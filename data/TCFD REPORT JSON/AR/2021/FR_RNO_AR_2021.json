They  merit  the  gratitude  and  appreciation  directed  at  all employees  of  the  Group.  You  have  shown  composure,  courage,  and great professionalism in an unprecedented crisis.\n\nThese results are in line with the meticulous work we have done over the past three years, which has strengthened the ties between governance and management considerably. The Board of Directors has hit its stride in cooperation with senior management, which has set the major steps of the recovery in motion: the savings plan rolled out in connection with a  commendable  dialogue  with  the  social  partners  and  the  local authorities, the relaunch of the Alliance, the choice to make France the foundation of our industrial base, and new governance appointments. Luca de Meo's drive and the power of the Renaulution plan have put the Group on a very good track with a clear, well-defined roadmap. I want to congratulate Luca and the management team.\n\nWe still  have  a  long  way  to  go  to  confirm  this  recovery  and  be  at  the same level as the top general automotive groups.\n\nOur momentum will continue in 2022 in circumstances that are just as uncertain, if not more so, than in 2021. In addition to the crises that will continue  this  year  related  to  health  conditions,  the  shortage  of semiconductors,  and  the  return  of  inflation,  uncertainties  due  to geopolitical  tensions  and  conflicts  are  having  painful  effects  on populations.\n\nThe  Group's  resilience  shown  in  recent  years  will  once  again  be  a condition for our continued recovery.\n\nWe have everything we need to achieve this, starting with the Alliance with Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, which demonstrated the remarkable momentum  of  our  collaboration  throughout  the  year.  The  decisions announced  on  January  27,  2022,  on  platform  sharing,  electrification, battery development, and electronic architecture are concrete proof of this.\n\nAnother  key  advantage  is  that  our  roots  in  France  are  even  stronger. Despite  the  competitiveness  gap  with  other  countries,  we  accept  this choice,  which  seems  all  the  more  relevant  in  the  face  of  the unpredictable  nature  of  globalisation.  The  decision  to  dedicate  nine vehicles  (mainly  electric)  to  France,  announced  when  we  signed  our labour deal, further strengthens our national base, already fortified by the initial achievements of the Refactory in Flins and the Electricity hub in the north.\n\nIn recent years, Renault Group has demonstrated its formidable ability to deal with internal and external crises. In what will again be a difficult environment,  I  have  every  confidence  in  the  talent  of  the  group's employees.  Driven  by  an  ambitious  product  plan  and  a  powerful strategy, we will make 2022 a new step in our recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group restored its profitability, achieving an operating margin  of  3.6%,  4.4  points  higher  than  in  2020.  It  generated  1.3  billion euros  of  free  cash  flow.  Renaulution's  targets  for  2021  were  met  and even  exceeded,  often  ahead  of  schedule.  The  breakeven  point  was lowered  by  40%,  with  a  target  of  -30%  by  2023,  and  fixed  costs  were reduced by \u20ac2 billions a year ahead of schedule.\n\nRenault is making one of the fastest turnarounds in automotive history, regaining its place in an increasingly tough race.\n\nThe hope for an end to the crisis was far from being realised last year. Inflation in raw material costs had an impact on Renault of half a billion euros. As for the electronic component crisis, it reduced our production by around 500,000 vehicles.\n\nThe  results  we  achieved  are  all  the  more  encouraging.  They demonstrate  the  strength  of  the  foundation  upon  which  the  Group  is being  rebuilt:  a  sound  commercial  policy,  the  ramp-up  of  a  product offensive to win back the market's most profitable segment, but also a new  enthusiasm  and  a  new  organisation-more  horizontal  and  more agile-fully focused on the market and our customers.\n\nAn  in-depth  transformation  is  underway,  laying  the  groundwork  for Renault's  competitive,  sustainable,  and  technological  future.  We  have already had success in high-profile projects. These include the launch of the  Refactory,  reinventing  Flins  around  the  circular  economy;  the Software  Factory;  and  the  inauguration  of  Electricity,  a  symbol  of  our spirit of conquest of the new automotive value chain.\n\nHowever,  the  quality  of  our  results  cannot  hide  the  magnitude  of  the challenges  ahead  with  the  growing  impact  of  inflation,  the  ongoing semiconductor crisis, and now the war in Ukraine.\n\nIn  this  volatile  environment,  we  will  continue  to  improve  our  pricing policy and cost control efforts in 2022 while counting on the expansion of  a  product  offensive  supported  by  seven  new  vehicles,  especially  in the C-segment.\n\nOur mobilisation is up against an environment that is more demanding than  ever.  The  strong  rebound  achieved  by  the  Group's  teams  in  2021 proves that Renault has all the resources to face these challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We do this because mobility is a source of fulfillment and freedom. We  believe  that  this  freedom  goes  hand  in  hand  with preserving the planet and living better together. That's why  we  challenge  ourselves  to  limit  our  impact  on  the climate  and  on  resources  and  to  make  mobility  more inclusive and safer for everyone.\n\n'A  company's  Purpose  is  both  its  roots  and  its  North Star.  The  roots  are  what  give  a  company  depth  and stability,  and  the  North  Star  is  the  desirable  future towards which all energy is turned'.\n\nJean-Dominique S\u00e9nard\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## We are daring, embracing the future with optimism.\n\nWe are a place where people can be themselves, playing their  part  in  a  shared  adventure.  We  are  proud  of  our diversity, our French  roots,  and  our  international presence,  which  makes  us  open  to  the  world.  We  are strengthened  by  the  Alliance  and  by  the  constructive relationships we forged with our partners. From our very beginning, our spirit of innovation has taken us further, creating value, anticipating mobility needs and bringing people closer.",

Across  the  brand,  electricpowered  vehicles,  all  technologies  combined,  represent 30% of private sales.\n\nSince its launch, with more than 354,000 units, ZOE is the best-selling electric vehicle in Europe.\n\nToday, it is  an  electric  revolution  that  is  picking  up  pace. A  dynamic  supported  by  the  Renaulution  strategic  plan and  the  'Nouvelle  Vague'  announced  by  Luca  de  Meo. A new era where all Renault brand electric vehicles will be popular and generate value.\n\nTo  continue  the  story  of  its  electric  revolution,  Renault unveiled the first model of its 'generation 2.0' of electric vehicles  at  the  IAA  Mobility  2021  in  Munich:  All-new Megane E-TECH Electric.\n\nThe new Megane E-TECH Electric is both an emotional and technological  breakthrough  in  Renault's  core  range. Connected and integrated into the EV ecosystem and the digital ecosystem of its users, it allows Renault to continue its history as the creator of 'cars for life and for living'.\n\nSporting Renault's new 'Nouvel'R' logo, the new Megane E-TECH Electric embodies the brand's transformation.\n\nTo cater to its customers, Renault continues to enhance its vehicles with innovative connected services.\n\nThe  new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  features  the  all-new openR\u00ae  HMI*,  which  brings  together  data  from  the instrument panel and the openRlink\u00ae multimedia system, offering Google Maps, Google Assistant and Google Store services, all within the same unit. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological on-board experience.\n\n*HMI = 'Human-Machine Interface'\n\n## E-TECH Hybrid and E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid\n\n## 'technical minute':\n\nHybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles are equipped with five main components:\n\n- \u25cf The  multi-mode,  clutchless  smart  gearbox  resulting  from our  Formula  1  experience  has  been  developed  to  reduce energy  losses.  It  has  a  total  of  15  modes:  three  for  electric and five for thermal, which can work together or not. It offers a  strong  acceleration  capacity,  intensity  in  mid-range acceleration and reduced consumption and CO2 emissions.\n- \u25cf An  e-engine,  the  main  electric  motor,  which  starts  the vehicle, ensures 100% electric driving, drives the wheels and allows the battery to be recharged.\n- \u25cf A  secondary  electric  motor  that  acts  as  a  starter  and high-voltage generator for the petrol engine. It also acts\n\nas a battery regenerator during hybrid driving and as a gear shift stabilizer to avoid jolts and vibrations.\n\n- \u25cf A  battery  that  stores  the  energy  necessary  for  vehicle travel  and  then  ensures  the  autonomy  of  the  vehicle  in electric  mode (battery size = 1.2 kWh for the hybrid and about 10 kWh for the plug-in hybrid).\n- \u25cf A  combustion  engine  specially  designed  to  reduce consumption  and  CO2  emissions.  It  is  equipped  with  a particulate filter and combines economy, efficiency and performance.\n\nThese features allow the E-TECH hybrid version to run in full-electric mode for up to 80% of city driving time. The ETECH  plug-in  hybrid  version  has  a  range  of  up  to  65  km (WLTP city) in full-electric mode.\n\n## Passenger cars (PC)\n\n## Passenger cars (PC) - EUROPE:\n\n## Renault's strategy to recapture the C segment:\n\nThe  'C'  segment  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Renaulution strategic plan. Renault has mobilized to win back ground on the market's most profitable segment. Renault Arkana began the offensive and has been very successful since its launch in March 2021. Renault continues the offensive in this  category  with  the  new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  and will  strengthen  its  position  in  2022  with  a  particularly ambitious  innovation:  Renault  Austral,  whose  name  was revealed on December 6, 2021. The vehicle was revealed in March 2022 during a 'digital world premi\u00e8re'.\n\n## Renault Arkana:\n\nWith  the  launch  of  its  sporty  Arkana  SUV  in  Europe  in spring 2021, Renault is reinventing market conventions. It has become the first volume manufacturer to offer an SUV coup\u00e9  in  Europe,  a  segment  that  until  now  has  been exclusive to premium brands.\n\nThis new offering, which complements the other models in the compact range (Megane, Kadjar and Scenic), is in line with a very fast-growing global SUV market - particularly in  the  C-segment.  It  is  a  precursor  to  the  renewal  of  the C-segment in the Renaulution plan.\n\nArkana  offers  a  range  of  multiple  hybrid  engines integrating  the  innovative  145  hp  E-TECH  hybrid  engine and its 1.3 TCe 12v mild-hybrid engines in 140 hp and 160 hp (since October 2021) versions.\n\nRenault  Arkana,  which  began  the  offensive  in  the C-segment,  has  been  very  successful  since  its  launch  in March 2021: 42,000 units have already been sold in Europe in less than a year, ranking it 25 th in its segment.\n\nThese  volumes  expand  on  those  already  achieved  in South Korea with 16,500 units in 2021, where the model is marketed under the name XM3.\n\nI\n\n01",

Thanks  to  the  Alliance-developed  CMF-EV  platform,  it rewrites the rulebook and pushes the boundaries in terms of design,  footprint/spaciousness  ratio  and  versatility.  The platform  fully  dedicated  to  electric  vehicles  also  brings exceptional  energy  efficiency  to  the  MEGANE  E-TECH Electric offering a range of up to 470 km WLTP.\n\nSporting  the  Renault's  new  'Nouvel'R'  logo,  the  New Megane E-TECH Electric embodies the brand's transformation.\n\nNew Megane E-TECH Electric symbolizes how the core of the market is being revolutionized, represents a gigantic leap forward in all aspects, and is exciting to drive each and every time. It features the all-new openR\u00ae HMI*, which merges dashboard data with the openRlink\u00ae multimedia system. Its two 12-inch large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological on-board experience.\n\n*HMI = 'Human-Machine Interface'\n\nThe New Megane E-TECH Electric is the first model to be 100%  'Made  in  ElectriCity',  Renault  Group's  new industrial  hub  and  European  leader  of  EV  vehicles located in the north of France.\n\nUnveiled  as  a  world  premiere  at  the  2021  IAA  Mobility  in Munich,  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  has  already been offered for pre-orders. Orders opened in December 2021 for initial deliveries in the first half of 2022.\n\n## Renault Austral:\n\nIn  2022,  Renault  will  refresh  its  offering  in  the  C-SUV category with a particularly ambitious product: Renault Austral.  This  Renaulution  compact  SUV  combines  the look  of  an  SUV  and  comfort  worthy  of  the  family minivans that have helped shape the history of Renault. Its elegant design is spiced up by a 'Esprit Alpine' finish, a  first  for  Renault.  This  version  offers  special  design aspects,  inspired  by  the  world  of  the  Alpine  brand, particularly dynamic and attractive.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, Renault Austral is the first Renault  vehicle  designed  on  the  CMF-CD3  platform jointly  developed  within  the  Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance.  It  benefits  from  a  fully  electric  engine  range,\n\nincluding two mild-hybrid units with 12v or 48v hybridization,  and  a  new  generation  of  the  E-TECH Hybrid system, developing up to 200 hp with a very low level  of  consumption  and  CO2  emissions  (105  g/km, subject to final approval).\n\nRenault  Austral's  generous  cabin  space  also  offers  an enhanced  driving  experience  thanks  to  high-tech equipment. The openR\u00ae HMI* brings together data from the  instrument  panel  with  the  openRlink\u00ae  multimedia system  all  within  the  same  unit.  Its  two  12-inch  large diagonal screens provide an unprecedented, technological  on-board  experience.  The  openRlink\u00ae multimedia system offers Google services. The 32 drive assistance  features  provide  peace  of  mind  and  safety for both the driver and the passengers.\n\nLastly,  quality  and  durability  have  been  at  the  heart  of Renault  Austral's  technical  specifications,  from  its development to its production.\n\n*HMI = 'Human-Machine Interface'\n\n## Renault Megane (C-sedan and estate segment):\n\nPending the launch of the New Megane E-TECH Electric, the Megane range continued to go electric in 2021 with the launch of the Megane E-TECH plug-in hybrid sedan. This  launch  achieved  a  mix  of  14%  of  the  Megane family's total sales of plug-in hybrids (sedan and estate).\n\nAcross  Europe,  Megane  maintains  its  number  10  spot and  its  market  share  of  4.1%  despite  the  crisis  in electronic components that affected its production this year,  especially  since  summer  2021.  For  the  first  time since  the  launch  of  the  4 th generation,  Megane  ranks number 1 in the C-sedan sub-segment in France with a market share of 16.6%.\n\nDriven by the success of its E-TECH plug-in hybrid offer, Megane Estate  remains  the  8 th best-selling  C-segment estate in Europe with a market share of 5.4%, up in the main countries where it is sold, including France Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands. The Estate version therefore  ends  its  first  year  in  France  with  a  market share of 24.5% (+3pts) in the C-estate sub-segment.\n\n## Renault Scenic and Grand Scenic (C-MPV segment):\n\nWith its seven seats, 718 L of boot space, 63 L of storage, its  modular  layout  allowing  all  the  seats  to  be  folded down  in  one  click,  and  its  numerous  driving  aids,  all combined with a fluid crossover silhouette, Grand Scenic offers a modern take on the minivan.\n\nIn 2021, the Scenic range attracted 20,695 customers on the continent, with a 13.7% segment share (-0.45 pts vs. 2020). This year, it occupied 4 th place in the European CMPV market and was leader in France and Belgium. In France,  the  SCENIC  (10,527  vehicles  sold)  represents  a segment  share  of  35.4%  (-4.2  pts  vs.  2020).  In  Belgium, SCENIC (1,985 vehicles sold) achieved a segment share of 21.7% (-11 pts vs. 2020).",

The  biggest  markets  for  Twingo  Electric  are France,  Germany  and  Italy,  which  together  account  for more than 70% of worldwide Twingo Electric sales. In 2021, there  was  a  general  shift  from  internal  combustion engines  to  electric  engines,  with  71%  Twingo  E-TECH vehicles in December.\n\nTwingo  Electric  benefits  from  Renault's  electric  vehicle expertise,  notably  through  ZOE,  Europe's  leader  in  electric vehicles for 10 years. Electric vehicle sales have increased to the point of achieving an equal share between the petrol and electric versions of the model in some countries.\n\nRenault  continues  to  market  its  longstanding  internal combustion version in parallel, with registrations reaching 18,247 units during the year.\n\nSales  of  Twingo  Electric  are  marked  by  a  significant proportion of top-of-the-range versions. This good distribution of sales allows the model's financial performance to exceed expectations.\n\nThe arrival of the new 'URBAN NIGHT' trim in the range at the  end  of  the  year  will  allow  Twingo  to  reach  a  wider, more  masculine  audience  and  satisfy  increasingly demanding design and urban mobility requirements.\n\n2022 will be an exciting year for Twingo, which will be able to  use  this  new  trim  to  satisfy  even  more  customers  and conquer new market shares in the electric vehicle sector.\n\n## On the B segment\n\n## Renault ZOE:\n\nCompetition  in  the  electric  vehicle  market  continued  to grow throughout 2021 with the arrival of many competitors. In this context, ZOE continues to be one of the leaders in terms of sales with 77,529 vehicles sold in 2021, placing it on the podium of electric vehicle sales.\n\nZOE  demonstrates  again  and  again  Renault's  desire  to build the future of vehicles thanks to the better autonomy of its segment, its top-level connectivity and its unequaled comfort.  ZOE  also  offers  many  passive  safety  features  as well  as  ADAS  up  to  market  standards,  such  as  automatic emergency braking with pedestrian and cyclist detection, lane keeping assist and an audible line departure warning.\n\nThe  biggest  markets  for  ZOE  are  France,  Germany,  the United Kingdom and Italy, all of which offer a wide range of products that perfectly match the needs of the market. In  Europe, ZOE performed well with a top place in France and in Turkey in particular.\n\nZOE  continues  to  write  the  Renault  electric  vehicle  story, which makes it a strategic vector for the brand. The model has  been  successful  for  10  years  thanks  to  the  many technical, technological and comfort improvements, allowing it to remain the segment's most attractive offering.\n\nIn a context of global shortage, ZOE managed to maintain a high delivery volume to satisfy its customers, holding the top spot in the European electric vehicle market, even for the months of January and October.\n\nZOE therefore remains an important pillar of the Renault range, and we continue to invest in this vehicle with design element  updates  planned  for  2022.  This  will  also  be  an opportunity to add a complementary wealth of equipment content  that  will  keep  ZOE  modern  and  attractive  for years to come.\n\n## Renault Clio:\n\nIn 2021, Clio was number 5 in global sales and number 3 in the  B-segment  with  nearly  257,530  vehicles  sold.  The steady  improvement  in  its  performance  throughout  the year  is  a  strong  testimony  to  the  impact  of  the  Renault brand on individuals. In addition, Clio remains the leader in the fleet market.\n\nIn  2021,  Clio  added a touch of elegance and modernity with the already recognized qualities of a well-equipped versatile compact with the launch of its limited edition 'LUTECIA' in September. This black and brass-toned version, accompanied by an innovative, unique interior textile (for its dashboard  and  door  panels)  derived  from  plant  fibers developed with Tencel\u2122, adds a new touch of sophistication.\n\nThis  reinforcement  of  Clio's  image  will  continue  in  2022 with the launch of a new range in April and a 100% hybrid limited edition in September.\n\nWith E-TECH hybrid, Clio ranked number 2 in the European hybrid  B  segment  in  2021  with  more  than  35,425  vehicles sold  as  of  the  end  of  December,  despite  a  negative downturn  starting  in  July  due  to  the  crisis  in  electronic components that led Renault to reduce its production.\n\nClio  E-TECH is expected to continue to grow in 2022. The resumption  of  production  at  the  end  of  2021  and  the reinforcement  of  the  communication  proposed  from December for Clio, 'A new chapter in a great story', should reassure  future  customers  about  the  simplicity  of  using hybrid technology for Clio and its advantages in terms of consumption while combining driving pleasure.\n\n## Renault Captur:\n\nIn  2021,  in  the  increasingly  contested  B-cross-over  subsegment,  Captur  expanded  its  range  and  bolstered  its dynamic  nature  with  the  R.S.  Line  trim  inspired  by  the motorsport  world  and  the  E-TECH  Hybrid  145  hp  engine introduced  in  the  first  half  of  2021.  Hybrid  technology means drivers can enjoy up to 80% electric driving on city roads  and  a  guaranteed  electric  start  100%  of  the  time. The  E-TECH  Hybrid  engine  also  saves  up  to  40%  on  fuel compared with an urban cycle thermal motor equivalent. This  hybrid  motor  rounds  out  the  range  of  plug-in  hybrid motors alongside the 160 hp Captur E-TECH Plug-in Hybrid.\n\nWith  a  choice  of  petrol  (TCe  90),  mild-hybrid  petrol (TCe 140, TCe140 EDC, TCE 160 EDC) or even bi-fuel petrolLPG motors (TCe 100 LPG), the Renault Captur range now offers a wide range of engine types, unique on its market, to meet all needs.\n\nI\n\n01",

Never before seen in the segment.\n\nAnother  new  feature  is  the  Easy  Inside  Rack  system, which  acts  as  an  interior  loading  rack  to  store  long objects  from  the  cargo  area  to  the  front.  Kangoo  Van offers a volume of 3.3 m 3 to 3.9 m 3 in the standard version and  4.2  m 3 to  4.9  m 3 for  the  long  version,  which  will  be launched in October 2022.\n\nKANGOO and KANGOO Z.E. are leaders in  Europe,  with 18.7%  of  the  small  van  segment. KANGOO  Z.E. -  the electric  model  -  took  17.9%  of  the  electric  LCV  market, with more than 10,600 vehicles sold over the year. More than 70,000 KANGOO Z.E. cars are on the road in Europe, making it a major contributor to sustainable mobility in the field of professional activities.\n\nIn  the  van  segment  (between  2  and  6.5  metric  tons), Renault is continuing its offensive with the TRAFIC and the MASTER, with 193,900 units sold in 2021.\n\nLaunched in January 2022, the New TRAFIC is a versatile van  with  a  refined  interior  design  and  expressive exterior (full LED headlights and light signature) and new Euro6DFull  engines  with  up  to  170  hp  and  an  EDC6 automatic gearbox.\n\nMore comfortable and designed to be used as a mobile office by professionals, the TRAFIC has record dimensions for usable length (4.15 m), with volume ranging from 5.2 to 8.6 m 3 .  The TRAFIC is available in 275 versions from  vans  to  flatbeds  to  crew  cabs  or  numerous  layout variations for panelwork and windows, lengths or heights.\n\nRenault TRAFIC is in the top 3 in Europe with annual sales of 79,100 in the Compact LCV segment in Europe (with a segment  share  of  15.4%).  It  is  manufactured  at  the Sandouville plant in France.\n\nIn the Large Van segment, Renault MASTER offers a new, larger and  more  robust  front  end,  a  completely redesigned  interior, new  ADAS  (Advanced  DriverAssistance  Systems)  and  new,  more  powerful  and quieter  engines.  It  makes  drivers'  lives  easier  with  new innovative  equipment  (extractable  dashboard  tablet, drawer-style glove box, induction smartphone charger, and for the first time in the segment, 'rear view assist', a rear view monitoring assistant).\n\nThe Renault MASTER offers 'made-to-measure' features,  with  over  350  versions,  four  lengths,  three heights,  vans,  combis,  platform  and  chassis  cab,  front and rear-wheel drive, etc., offering a working volume of between 8 and 22m 3 .\n\nIn  terms  of  engines,  the  Renault  MASTER  has  a  new range  of  Euro6DFull/EuroVI  for  engines  even  better suited for professional uses. They have increased power of up to 180 hp and increased torque of up to 400 Nm for a  more  dynamic  and  responsive  driving  experience while keeping fuel consumption low.",

It  is  sold  in  nearly 50 countries. In Europe, the share of the LCV Large Vans segment  stood  at  14.6%  (including  sales  of  Renault Trucks),  thus  allowing  Renault  MASTER  to  consolidate third  place  on  the  podium.  Internationally,  in  2021  the Renault MASTER positioned itself as a leader on strategic markets,  including  Brazil  (57.6%  segment  share)  and Morocco (25.8% market share).\n\nThe pick-up market represents a potential for the Group to win new customers. Renault ALASKAN and Renault OROCH form the backbone of this market offensive.\n\nIn the Americas, Renault ALASKAN is sold in Argentina and Colombia. In 2021, 5,300 ALASKAN units were sold in these territories.\n\nBefore  its  renewal  in  March  2022,  OROCH  represented 25,900 units in 2021. The OROCH remained the leader of its segment or among the top performers in most countries (number  1  in  Columbia,  number  2  in  Mexico,  number  3  in Argentina and number 4 in Brazil).\n\n## In the electric light commercial vehicle segment:\n\nFor the 11 th consecutive year, KANGOO Z.E. remains by far the leader in Europe, with electric segment share of 46.6%. In  May  2022,  the  new  KANGOO  E-TECH  electric  van  will take  over  with  the  innovations  of  the  New  KANGOO  van ('OPEN SESAME' side door, Easy Inside Rack, etc.) plus the best electric range in the segment with 300 Km WLTP.\n\nIn  June 2022, Renault will launch MASTER E-TECH electric with  a  new  52  kWh  battery  and  a  range  extended  to 204 Km WLTP.\n\nThe new range offers:\n\n- \u25cf three types of bodies (van, floor cab, chassis cab);\n- \u25cf a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 3.1 or 3.5 metric tons,  allowing  a  payload  of  up  to  1,700  kg  (before transformation);\n- \u25cf from 8 m 3 to 22 m 3 of effective volume.\n\nIn  addition,  in  July  2022,  HYVIA,  Renault  Group's  JV  with PLUG POWER, will launch a MASTER E-TECH H2, the Master Hydrogen  version,  which  offers  a  driving  range  of  up  to 500 km WLTP thanks to the addition of a fuel cell.\n\n## Dacia, the brand that constantly redefines what is essential\n\nFounded  in  1968  then  launched  from  2004  all  across Europe  and  Mediterranean  countries,  Dacia  has  always offered  the  best  value-for-money  cars  by  constantly redefining  the  essentials.  Dacia  is  a  game  changer offering simple, multipurpose, reliable cars in tune with its\n\ncustomers'  lifestyles.  Dacia  models  became  a  reference on the market: Logan, the brand-new car at the price of a used one; Sandero, the most sold car to European private customers;  Duster,  the  most  affordable  SUV;  Spring,  the champion  of  the  accessible  electric  mobility  in  Europe. Dacia is a brand of Renault Group, with a presence in 44 countries. Since 2004, Dacia has sold more than 7 million vehicles.\n\nDacia  was  founded  in  the  late  1960s  with  one  clear objective: to provide modern, robust, economical cars for all Romanians.\n\nIn  1999,  guided  by  Louis  Schweitzer,  Dacia  joined  Renault Group and opened up to new ambitions.\n\nThis turning point in the brand's history came in 2004 with the  launch  of  Logan,  a  modern,  robust  and,  above  all, affordable  family  sedan.  Initially  designed  for  emerging markets,  at  an  unbeatable  price  of  5,000  euros,  it  was  a great  commercial  success,  including  in  Western  Europe, where it went on sale in 2005. A new vehicle at a secondhand price, it was a revolution in the car market.\n\n2008 saw the arrival of the Sandero, Dacia's second major launch  under  Renault  Group.  It  also  proved  to  be  its biggest  commercial  success.  Its  many  advantages  -  an interior  volume  worthy  of  a  higher  segment,  a  practical, versatile spirit and an affordable price - have made it the top-selling car for individuals in Europe since 2017.\n\nIn  2010,  Dacia  launched  the  Duster,  an  attractive  vehicle with  true  off-road  capabilities.  It  was  once  again  a commercial  success,  selling  more  than  two  million  units worldwide.\n\nA new revolution is underway with the Spring. Launched in March  2021,  this  SUV-style  city  car  allows  Dacia  to  once again  shake  up  conventions  and  democratize  electric mobility.  With  remarkable  range  and  energy  efficiency, Spring  impressed  many  of  the  32  members  of  the AUTOBEST jury and won the 'AUTOBEST - Best Buy Car of 2022' award.\n\nThe latest addition to the range, Dacia Jogger, reinvents the family  car.  As  either  a  5-  or  7-seater,  Jogger  perfectly embodies  Dacia's  positioning  and  spirit.  With  versatility thanks to its record levels of space and modularity and an attractive,  rugged  design,  Jogger  is  made  for  adventure. This  model  reinforces  Dacia's  commitment  to  making mobility accessible to all: a sustainable mobility since it will soon  be  offered  with  a  hybrid  engine.  Jogger  is  the  ideal companion for all daily activities or family recreation.\n\nDacia  thus  offers  a  complete  range  of  light  vehicles equipped with efficient engines based on Renault Group's proven  technology.  Dacia  is  the  European  leader  in  this field, offering dual-fuel vehicles (LPG and petrol) across its entire range.\n\nI\n\n01",

From  design  to  sales,  manufacturing  and  transport,  the brand remains faithful to its strategy of optimizing costs at every step so that its customers pay only for what they need.\n\nIts  ambition?  To  conquer  new  territories  based  on  a unique and particularly effective business model, with a  wider  range  that  always  focuses  on  essential customer needs. In January 2021, at the presentation of the Renaulution strategic plan, the brand revealed the Bigster Concept, which heralded this opening up to the C-segment.\n\nWith the Bigster Concept, Dacia gives us the proof that it will be even more attractive, cooler, and more outdoors, yet  still  accessible  and  focused  on  the  essential.  Made for  the  open  air  and  dusty  roads,  the  Bigster  Concept offers just  the  essentials  for  an  SUV  of  its  segment.  No need for gimmicks, chrome, fake aluminum, it embodies the  essential  and  makes  bold  choices,  as  shown  using untreated recycled materials for the exterior protective components.  Its  simple  lines  and  timeless  proportions evoke  sturdiness,  reinforce  its  adventurous  side  and bring a wind of freedom to the brand. Dacia is becoming synonymous with escapism to  enable  its  customers  to enjoy unique, real, simple experiences.\n\nTo  embody  its  brand  vision,  Dacia  is  readying  itself  to write a new chapter in its history with a completely new visual  identity.  A  new  world  for  the  brand,  new  visual features  with  an  outdoor  spirit  to  fulfill  the  desires  for escape,  freedom  and  authenticity  and  to  express  the essentials of today: to reconnect with our environment and share simple pleasures with those closest to us.\n\n## In 2021, Dacia accelerated and rose on the European private sales podium.\n\nUp 3.1% on the previous year, Dacia's volumes will reach 537,095 units in 2021 in a stable market, heavily affected by the health crisis and the electronic components crisis. Within its sales scope, Dacia increased its market share by 0.1 pt to 3.5%.\n\nDacia's growth is due in particular to the success of its new  range  with  private  customers.  In  2021,  Dacia achieved  a  record  6.2%  share  of  the  European passenger  car  market,  making  it  for  the  first  time  the 3 rd best-selling brand in Europe in this channel.\n\nDacia is the number 1 passenger car brand in France and Romania  and  in  the  top  five  in  nine  other  European markets (Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary and Croatia). In Germany, the\n\nbrand  is  in  the  top  10,  and  Dacia  maintains  its  lead position in Morocco.\n\nThis  performance  is  based  on  the  success  of  the  new generations of Sandero and Duster .\n\nDacia Sandero sold 226,825 units in 2021, with almost 90% of the volume through the third generation of the model. In 2021, for the 5 th year in a row, Dacia Sandero is the bestselling  model  for  private  customers  in  Europe.  In  some countries, Sandero is  even  the  best-selling car across all customer  channels,  making  it  the  2 nd best-selling passenger car in Europe across all sales channels.\n\nDacia  Duster is  following  the  same  trend  by  being  the best-selling  SUV  for  private  customers  in  Europe  since 2018.  With  186,001  units  sold  in  2021  in  all  countries combined, Duster has  exceeded  2  million  units  on  the road since its launch in 2010.\n\nLaunched  in  the  spring, Dacia  Spring has  successfully entered the fully electric vehicle market with 27,876 units sold and received more than 46,000 orders as of the end of 2021. Designed for greater access to electric cars for everyday travel, Spring is becoming a city car leader on many  markets,  and  80%  of Spring buyers  were  not previously customers of the brand.\n\n## A product range moving up\n\nDesigned around customer essentials, the Dacia range is becoming increasingly attractive thanks to its betterequipped versions. For example, 90%  of Dacia Spring customers  opt  for  the  Comfort  Plus  trim,  the Stepway version accounts for 70% of Sandero sales, and 60% of Duster customers prefer the Prestige package.\n\nThis  enthusiasm  for  the  best-equipped  versions  is accompanied  by  a  conquest  rate  (excluding  Renault Group) of 60%. When it's time for a replacement, 75% of Dacia customers choose to remain with Renault Group.\n\n## LADA: continued steady development\n\nAn  iconic  leader  in  the  Russian  market  for  over  50  years, LADA is an integral part of Renault Group's family of brands.\n\nLADA  vehicles  are  designed,  produced  and  sold  by AVTOVAZ,  Russia's  leading  carmaker  and  a  partner  of Renault  Group  since  2008,  also  manufacturing  vehicles for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance for the Russian market and CIS countries. The AVTOVAZ group operates in Russia at the Togliatti industrial site with three vehicle assembly  lines  and  eight  mechanical  component  and unit  manufacturing plants and at the Izhevsk site with a vehicle assembly line and component lines. Revenues in 2021  totaled  \u20ac3.5  billion,  with  40,889  employees  and  an annual production of 433,430 vehicles and kits. The LADA distribution network  is  the  largest  in  Russia  with 300 dealerships. The AVTOVAZ  group also has 30 subsidiaries in operation.",

        "page_content": "With the launch of LADA Vesta in 2015 and LADA XRAY in 2016,  a  new  era  began  for  the  LADA  brand,  with  major ambitions: a fully renewed range of vehicles and services, accessible  and  adapted  to  the  needs  of  Russian  and export  markets,  attractive  new  design  concepts  and  a rapidly  changing  network.  At  the  end  of  2019,  with  the modernization of NIVA Legend, LADA marked a new step in the  enrichment  of  the  brand  and  confirmed  its leadership as the manufacturer of unbeatable, affordable all-terrain vehicles. At the end of 2019, AVTOVAZ took over all  shares  in  the  GM-AVTOVAZ  joint  venture,  with  the Chevrolet NIVA vehicle being rebranded as LADA in 2020 and NIVA Travel in early 2021.\n\nIn 2021, LADA confirmed its vitality and the implementation of its product strategy with the successful evolution of two key models: the popular 5 or 7 seat LARGUS (as well as the LCV  versions)  and  NIVA  Travel.  A  further  step  was  taken with  the  introduction  of  the  EnjoY/EnjoY  Pro  multimedia connected systems on LADA Vesta, XRAY and Granta.\n\nLADA  is  in  line  to  maintain  its  leadership  in  the  Russian market and expand abroad.\n\nIn  2021,  thanks  to  the  transformation  mentioned  above, but  also  taking  into  account  the  severe  electronic components crisis, LADA's worldwide sales increased by 0.3% to 385,391 vehicles*, of which 350,714 were sold on the Russian market and 34,677 to its importers across 17 export markets.\n\nThe LADA brand is the leader of the Russian automotive market with a market share of 21 % in 2021.\n\nThis  sustainable  growth  in  recent  years  is  driven  by  the success of its models in a very competitive environment, with  four  LADA  vehicles  among  the  Top  10  most  sold passenger  cars  in  Russia,  including  LADA  Vesta  at number 1, LADA Granta at number 2, the LADA NIVA family at number 6 and LADA LARGUS PC at number 10. LADA is on the top two steps of the podium with Vesta and Granta for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nIn a very difficult context, LADA maintained its leadership in Belarus with a market share of over 24.9 % (+4.9 pts vs. 2020) with the best-selling LADA Vesta and in Azerbaijan (+54.6 % vs. 2020) with the best-selling LADA Niva Legend.\n\nAVTOVAZ developed a new industrial project in Kazakhstan  with  a  new  industrial  partner  and  two distribution  partners  in  order  to  consolidate  its  position  in this important market. AVTOVAZ also started a new project with an industrial and commercial partner in Uzbekistan.\n\nGrowth  in  Egypt  thanks  to  the  success  of  the  locally assembled LADA Granta and the government's scrapping program.  Internationally,  sales  in  Bolivia  increased  by +51.4% over the previous year.\n\nAVTOVAZ  also  produced  more  than  51,621  vehicles  for Renault,  including  the  popular  models  Renault  LOGAN, LOGAN Stepway, SANDERO and SANDERO Stepway.\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## Alpine: a renewed ambition\n\nAs part of Renault Group's Renaulution, Alpine announced in  January 2021 its plans for long-term growth as Renault Group's  brand  dedicated  to  innovative,  authentic  and exclusive sports cars.\n\nIn  2021,  the  activities  of  Alpine  Cars,  Renault  Sports  Cars and Renault Sport Racing are united as one entity under the Alpine brand. The newly created entity intends to be a 'new  generation'  automotive  Brand  for  discerning, passionate early adopters. Alpine also leverages the scale and  capabilities  of  Renault  Group  and  the  RNM  Alliance including technology with the Alliance EV-native platform, a  global  manufacturing  footprint,  a  powerful  purchasing arm  ensuring  optimum  cost  competitiveness,  a  global distribution network, as well as RCI Bank and Services.\n\n## Alpine's 100% electric garage\n\nThe  new  organizational  structure,  the  intensification  of synergies  with  Renault  Group  and  the  Alliance  and collaboration with selected partners will be instrumental to support Alpine's product plan:\n\n- \u25cf a  100%  electric  compact  sports  car  (B  segment)  based on the Alliance's CMF-B EV platform;\n- \u25cf a  100% electric  sports  crossover  (C  segment)  based  on the Alliance's CMF-EV platform;\n- \u25cf a 100% EV to replace the A110 and developed with Lotus.\n\nThe  next  generation  of  Alpine  products  will  leverage Renault  Group's  latest  innovations  and  will  benefit  from F1's technology and expertise: efficient energy management, safety systems and connectivity solutions derived from F1's high performance in data analysis and processing  that  will  bring  a  significant  competitive advantage to the Alpine products.\n\n## New Alpine A110 range\n\nIn 2021, Alpine introduced the A110 Legend GT 2021, a limited edition of 300 units for Europe. This very exclusive version of the  A110  quickly  found  its  audience,  as  all  the  units  were sold out in less than a month. This version of the A110 was also named car of the year at the Automobiles Awards held in December at the Automobile Club de France.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Alpine unveiled its new A110 range with three philosophies but always the same driving pleasure:\n\n- \u25cf The Alpine A110 is  the  gateway into the Alpine universe. The 'Alpine' chassis and 252 bhp engine are as pleasant to  drive  as  the  Berlinette.  The  car  is  light,  lively  and precise, and stays agile and vibrant in all circumstances.\n- \u25cf The all-new  Alpine  A110  GT is  the  range's  touring  car sports coup\u00e9. Its 300 bhp engine paired with the 'Alpine' chassis strikes a blissful balance between performance and  comfort.  It's  hard  to  find  a  car  that's  this  versatile and  elegant.  It's  a  sports  car  for  everyday  and  longdistance driving alike.\n\nI\n\n01",

Its 'Sport' chassis is made to  measure for the 300 bhp engine's full might. It has a sports car's soul and comes with optional semi-slick tires and  a  custom-made  aerodynamic  kit  that  will  wow drivers  who  value  precision,  especially  on  tracks.  The New A110 S is uncannily gung-ho and packed with thrills and chills.\n\n## Competition at the heart of the brand\n\nIn September 2020, Luca De Meo, CEO of Renault Group, announced that Alpine, a brand born from motor racing, would develop and enter its name in the Formula 1 World Championship.  Starting  from  the  2021  season,  the Renault  Group  team,  one  of  the  most  successful  and longest-running in the history of Formula 1, has become the  Alpine  F1\u00ae  Team,  equipped  with  a  Renault  E-TECH hybrid engine.\n\nThroughout the season, Alpine F1\u00ae Team was regularly in the  points  thanks  to  the  work  of  the  Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon  and Enstone teams, but also the performance of its drivers, to convert opportunities into great victories. At the end of  the  11th  race  of  the  season  in  Hungary,  Alpine  F1\u00ae Team scored its first victory in Formula 1. Esteban Ocon won the race, taking the top step on the podium for the first  time in his career. The season was also marked by Fernando Alonso's first podium under the Alpine flag at the Qatar Grand Prix. The Alpine F1\u00ae Team finished the 2021  FIA  Formula  1  World  Championship  season  in  fifth place in the Manufacturer Championship with 155 points.\n\n2021  also  saw  the  return  of  Alpine  to  the  premier  class (hypercars) of the WEC (World Endurance Championship).  At  the  end  of  a  very  good  season, marked by a superb podium at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the  Team  Alpine  Elf  Matmut  Endurance  Team  finished 2 nd in the championship.\n\nThe customer competition is not left out with the Alpine Elf  Europa  Cup,  Alpine  A110  Rally  and  Alpine  A110  GT4 programs, which are still  performing well  and  continue to win in their respective classes.\n\nAlpine  reported  strong  earnings  growth  for  2021  with 2,659  vehicles  sold  in  2021,  up  74%  on  2020.  In  France, Alpine sales were up by +117% compared with 2020.\n\nAlpine  is  pursuing  its  internationalization  objectives, projecting its sales beyond the borders of France while targeting promising markets abroad. In 2021, sales in the United  Kingdom  increased  by  more  than  92%,  in  the DACH  market  (Germany,  Austria  and  Switzerland)  by around  24%,  in  the  Italian  market  by  79%  and  in  the Iberian market (Spain and Portugal) by 120%.\n\nWith  a  network  of  100  dealerships  at  the  end  of  2021 (25  new  outlets  vs.  the  end  of  2020),  mainly  in  France  and Europe, Alpine will continue to expand geographically with an additional 50 dealerships in 2022, in Europe and worldwide.\n\n## MOBILIZE: a new brand dedicated to mobility, energy and data services\n\nFounded  in  January  2021,  Mobilize  is  the  fourth  brand  of Renault  Group.  It  offers  mobility  services  for  people  and goods, for individuals, companies, operators and territories.\n\nMobilize  simplifies  access  to  new  mobility  through  a comprehensive, usage-based offering ranging from mobility solutions to energy and data.

The names of certain  services  were  changed  in  2021  for  better integration into the Mobilize offer:\n\n- \u25cf Zity, Mobilize's self-service car-sharing service becomes 'Zity  by  Mobilize'.  The  service  is  available  in  Madrid (since  2017)  and  in  Paris  /  Boulogne-Billancourt  /  Clichy (since 2020). New cities were added to the service area in the  Paris  region  in  2021  (Issy-les-Moulineaux,  Vanves, S\u00e8vres and Meudon).\n- \u25cf Renault Mobility,  Mobilize's  in-branch  and  self-service rental  service,  became  'Mobilize  Share'.  New  cities welcomed the service in 2021 in Italy (Bergamo and four neighboring  municipalities)  and  in  France  (Arcachon, Luitr\u00e9-Dompierre and Toulouse).\n- \u25cf The application  is  available  in  Germany,  Belgium  and Spain. Elexent solutions, dedicated to the recharging of electric fleets, became 'Mobilize Power Solutions'.",

The app is available in Germany, Belgium and Spain.\n- \u25cf 'Mobilize  Smart  Charge':  this  app  allows  Renault  EV owners  to  optimize  the  cost  of  charging  their  car  at home  while  reducing  their  carbon  footprint  and  is available in France, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n- \u25cf 'Battery  Certificate':  this  app  allows  owners  of  Renault and  Dacia  electric  vehicles,  in  France,  to  create  a certificate  showing  their  battery's  remaining  energy\n\ncapacity  directly  on  their  smartphone  or  the  internet. Objective: to facilitate the sale of used electric vehicles.\n\nMobilize  is  committed  to  carbon  neutrality,  the  circular economy and extending the life cycle of vehicles. Within the  Flins  Re-Factory,  Mobilize  is  centralizing  initiatives  to extend the life cycle of vehicles and batteries. It implements  solutions  for  the  reuse  of  batteries,  in particular for energy storage solutions, and thus supports the energy transition.\n\nMobilize solutions can be combined within the territories to help them achieve carbon neutrality, as is already the case in the  Smart  Islands,  in  Europe  (Porto-Santo,  Belle-\u00cele-en-Mer, Ile d'Yeu, etc.), and in Brazil (Fernando de Noronha).\n\nI\n\n01",

Business-to-business Powertrain activity\n\nThe  powertrain  business  provides  major  manufacturing R&D  synergies  with  the  other  Alliance  members  and Renault Group partners. A dedicated department oversees this B-to-B Powertrain activity, both in respect of exchanges  of  powertrain  parts  with  partners,  and  for related engineering activities. The aim of these synergies is  to  pool  development  costs,  absorb  fixed  production costs, and generate economies of scale in the industrial activities of Renault and its suppliers in order to optimize Renault Group's free cash flow. In addition to the alliance with  Nissan  and  MMC,  which  share  a  common  range  of products,  an  industrial  system  and  a  supplier  network, this activity  seeks  to  promote  and  offer  Renault's powertrain units in the context of automotive cooperation or third-party sales. These operations enable our partners to benefit from Renault technology and give Renault access, where useful, to its partners' developments and manufacturing capacity. This activity also  serves  to  identify  and  set  up  one-off  cooperation projects and to evaluate our competitiveness and level of quality compared with our competition.\n\n## Strengths\n\nA  modern,  CO2-efficient  powertrain  range:  with  its internal combustion, hybrid and electric range, Renault has  once  again  demonstrated  its  commitment  to reducing the environmental footprint of vehicles throughout  their  life  cycle.  The  qualities  of  the  Renault powertrain  range  have  convinced  our  partners  of  the advantages of using our engines for their vehicles.\n\nNissan, Renault's partner in the Alliance, has thus relied on the latest generations of Renault engines to reduce average CO2 emissions in its range of passenger cars in Europe.\n\nRenault Group is among the most efficient manufacturers in  Europe  in  terms  of  certified  CO2  emissions  (based  on 2021  CAFE).  For  more  details,  refer  to  chapter  2.2.2.1.2.3 'Tools  and  processes  in  place  to  manage  risks  and opportunities'.\n\n## The organization\n\nIn Renault's Strategy, Business  Development  and Business  Management  Department,  dedicated  teams work to detect opportunities, prepare bids and negotiate  contracts.  Sensitive  to  the  expectations  of carmaker  customers,  these  teams  allow  for  optimal responsiveness by interfacing with all Renault Engineering departments.\n\n## 1.1.5.4. Main manufacturing sites Production figures\n\nTo  meet  the  demands  of  its  customers,  Renault  Group relies on an industrial footprint consisting of 40 industrial sites located around the world as close as possible  to  the  markets  in  which  it  sells  its  brands' vehicles.\n\nAll these sites operate under common principles:\n\n- \u25cf making employee safety a priority;\n- \u25cf making customer satisfaction a priority;\n- \u25cf constantly working to improve the competitiveness of our  sites,  in  particular  through  convergence  towards our  industry  4.0  vision  (see  section  2.3.3.7  'Plants  that are transforming');\n- \u25cf integration of the value chain.\n\nThe Alliance and Renault Group's strategic partnerships offer opportunities for synergies based on the pooling of production  resources  and  enable  us  to  increase  the industrial activity of our sites. Thus:\n\n- \u25cf the  plants  in  Flins, Batilly, Maubeuge,  Sandouville, Moscow  and  Cordoba  produce  vehicles  for  Nissan.  In 2020,  Sandouville  started  the  production  of  a  van  for Mitsubishi;\n- \u25cf the  plants  in  Maubeuge  and  Novo  Mesto  produce vehicles for Daimler;\n- \u25cf Sandouville and  Batilly produce  light commercial vehicles for other partners such as GM, Renault Trucks or Fiat;\n- \u25cf finally, in India, Renault Group and Nissan share a plant common to both.\n\nFor  the  production  of  powertrain  parts,  the  crossutilization  of  Alliance  plants  makes  it  possible  to  share investments  and  optimize  the  use  of  our  production capacities. Some examples:\n\n- \u25cf for Nissan and Daimler, diesel engines are produced in the  Renault  Group  plants  in  Cl\u00e9on  and  Valladolid  as well as petrol engines in Valladolid and Pitesti;\n- \u25cf in Europe, Nissan's Sunderland plant produces engines for  Renault.  In  Japan,  Nissan's  Yokohama  plant  also produces  a  gasoline  engine  for  Renault.  In  India, Nissan's  Chennai  plant  produces  powertrains  for Renault;\n- \u25cf gearboxes  are  assembled  for  Daimler  and  Nissan  in Cl\u00e9on, for Nissan in Pitesti, Seville, Cacia and Los Andes;\n- \u25cf AVTOVAZ  assembles  engines  and  gearboxes  for Renault and Nissan;\n- \u25cf the  Le  Mans  plant  manufactures  chassis  for  Nissan, Mitsubishi,  Daimler  and  GM  as  well  as  for  Renault  Group brands.\n\nRenault  Group  also  relies  on  partnerships  and/or industrial cooperation for the production of vehicles:\n\n- \u25cf in  China:  in  Shiyan  (eGT)  for  production  of  Spring,  in Shenyang  (RBJAC)  for  production  of  the  Jinbei  brand and in Nanchang (JMEV) for production of vehicles for the EV Easy brand;\n- \u25cf In  Kazakhstan,  in  March  2021,  AVTOVAZ  and  Allur Group  signed  a  cooperation  agreement  for  the production of LADA models in Kostanay;\n- \u25cf In Lagos, Nigeria, Coscharis assembles DKD (Dismantled  Knocked  Down)  vehicles  for  the  Dacia brand.",

The Renault Group sales network\n\n## Organization of the distribution networks\n\nRenault  Group  distributes  vehicles  under  its  brands  through both primary and secondary distribution networks.\n\nThe primary network is contractually bound to Renault Group brands via a concession agreement (or agency or authorized  repair  center  agreement,  depending  on  the country) and comprises:\n\n- \u25cf dealers independent of Renault Group;\n- \u25cf establishments belonging to Renault Group through its subsidiary Renault Retail Group (RRG) or branches.\n\nThe  secondary  network  includes  mainly  smaller  sites, independent of Renault Group, and bound contractually to  the  primary  network,  most  often  through  an  agency contract or through an authorized distribution or repair\n\ncenter contract. These are generally smaller sites whose role  is  to  round  out  the  territorial  coverage  of  the primary networks of the Renault Group brands.\n\nIn the context of Renaulution presented at the beginning of 2021, the Renault and Dacia brands announced the renewal of their visual identity, the coordinated deployment of which will start in 2022. At the same time, in collaboration with the Renault  Enlarged  Dealership  Group  (GCRE),  Renault  Group has redefined the bases  of the future contractual relationship  with  its  Renault  and  Dacia  Networks,  whose new  contracts  will  enter  into  force  in  2024.  Renault  Group has thus confirmed its ambition to ensure sustainable and profitable growth for the Manufacturer and for its network by relying on strong independent players who promote the image of Renault Group's brands while optimizing territorial coverage in order to meet customers' expectations.\n\nCustomer  satisfaction  is  a  core  focus  of  Renault  Group's policy. The acceleration of sales of E-TECH vehicles relies on the continuous upgrading of methods, support for networks, the spread of E-TECH services and the necessary skills.\n\n|                                          | 2021   | 2021       | 2020*   | 2020*      |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|------------|---------|------------|\n| Number of Renault sites                  | Global | o/w Europe | Global  | o/w Europe |\n| Primary network                          | 5,152  | 2,619      | 5,161   | 2,668      |\n| o/w RRG dealers and branches             | 159    | 147        | 199     | 185        |\n| o/w Renault Pro+ specialized dealerships | 667    | 507        | 664     | 504        |\n| Secondary network                        | 5,288  | 5,007      | 5,474   | 5,186      |\n| Total Sites                              | 10,440 | 7,626      | 10,653  | 7,854      |\n|                                          | 2021   | 2021       | 2020    | 2020       |\n| Number of Dacia sites                    | Global | o/w Europe | Global  | o/w Europe |\n| Primary network                          | 2,986  | 2,626      | 3,049   | 2,679      |\n|                                          | 2021   | 2021       | 2020    | 2020       |\n| Number of LADA sites                     | Global | o/w Russia | Global  | o/w Russia |\n| Primary network                          | 470    | 311        | 470     | 296        |\n|                                          | 2021   | 2021       | 2020    | 2020       |\n| Number of Alpine sites                   | Global | Europe     | Global  | Europe     |\n| Primary network                          | 100    | 83         | 75      | 58         |\n|                                          |        | 2021       |         | 2020       |\n| Number of Renault Samsung Motors sites   |        | Korea      |         | Korea      |\n| Primary network* (*: change of scope)    |        | 670        |         | 715        |\n| Number of Jinbe\u00ef sites                   |        | 2021       |         | 2020       |\n|                                          |        | China      |         | China      |\n| Primary network                          |        | 255        |         | 246        |\n\n- * The 2020 data have been reviewed and revised.",

Its arbitrage  activity  allows  it  to  obtain  very  competitive quotes  for  financial  products  from  foreign  exchange markets,  interest  rates  or  raw  materials.  This  makes  it Renault's  natural  counterparty  for  most  automotive market  transactions.  By  extending  this  service  to  the Nissan group, Renault Finance has become  the Alliance's trading room.\n\nTo  optimize  the  quality  of  the  service  provided  to  the Alliance,  Renault  Finance  is  equipped  with  some  of  the most advanced tools on the interbank markets and has a wholly  owned  subsidiary  in  Singapore,  Renault  Treasury Services.\n\n## 1.1.5.8. Partnerships and cooperation\n\n## Strategic cooperation between the Renault-Nissan Alliance and Daimler AG\n\nRefer to the 'Strategic cooperation' paragraph, chapter 1.2.4 of this document.\n\n## Autonomous vehicles\n\nIn  2019,  Renault  Group  and  Nissan  signed  an  exclusive Alliance  agreement  with Waymo for  the  study  of autonomous mobility  services  for  people  and  goods  in France and Japan.\n\nThis  agreement  pools  the  three  partners'  strengths  and extends their expertise through the assessment of market opportunities and joint research work on commercial, legal and  regulatory  issues  related  to  autonomous  mobility service  offers  in  France  and  Japan.  Their  international\n\ndimension  and  the  complementary  fit  of  their  offers, covering every segment of light commercial vehicles and passenger  cars,  perfectly  position  Renault  Group  and Nissan to undertake this exploratory work with Waymo, a company specializing in driverless technologies with tens of millions of kilometers on open roads.\n\n## Electric vehicles\n\nIn  2021,  Renault  Group  signed  a  strategic  partnership with Envision  AESC to  set  up  a  gigafactory  in  Douai, integrated  into  the  new  ElectriCity  industrial  complex (grouping  together  the  three  sites  in  northern  France: Douai,  Maubeuge  and  Ruitz)  to  produce  low-carbon, cost-competitive,  state-of-the-art batteries, making electric  mobility  more  accessible  in  Europe.  For  more details, refer to chapter 2.2.10 of this document.\n\nIn  July  2021,  Renault  Group  acquired a minority stake in French start-up Verkor to  co-develop and manufacture high-performance batteries. The partnership also includes  the  development  of  a  pilot  production  line  in France  for  battery  cells  and  module  prototyping  from 2022. In a second step, starting from 2026, Verkor aims to build the first gigafactory  for high performance batteries in France, with an initial capacity of 10 GWh for Renault Group, potentially rising to 20 GWh by 2030.\n\nIn September 2021, the Group acquired a minority stake in  French  start-up Whylot ,  based  in  the  department  of Lot,  which  has  developed  a  unique  technology  in  the promising  sector  of  innovative  electric  motors.  This entry  into  the  capital  of  the  French  start-up  reinforces the  existing  strategic  partnership  between  the  two players.  Announced  at  Eways  2  in  June  2021,  this partnership  with  Whylot  aims  to  develop  and  massproduce  an  innovative  automotive  axial  flux  e-motor. This technology will be applied to electrified and electric powertrains,  with  the  goal  in  hybrid  powertrains  of reducing  costs  while  saving  2.5  g/km  CO2  emissions according to the WLTP standard (for passenger cars of the B/C segments). Renault Group will be the first OEM to produce axial flux e-motor on a large scale from 2025.\n\n## Used vehicles\n\nRenault  Group  and  its  subsidiary  RCI  Bank  and Services,  specialized  in  automotive  financing  and services,  acquired  an  equity  stake  in Mobility  Trader Holding  GmbH in  December  2021  to  contribute  to  the development of the Heycar platform in Europe and with a view to its launch in France.\n\nFounded  in  2017  by  Mobility  Trader  Holding  GmbH,  the Heycar platform has rapidly grown in the European used car market, with an international offering of more than 350,000 certified and guaranteed vehicles, a network of more  than  6,000  dealers  and  a  range  of  value-added services.

These offers are already deployed in 11 countries in Europe with local partners: in France with the company Solstyce, in Germany with GP Joule, in Belgium with Enersol and in Spain with IBIL. Since 2017, Renault has also been partnering with Jedlix, a Dutch technology startup with which Renault has developed an intelligent mobile charging  app  for  electric  vehicles,  guaranteeing  users carbon-free  electricity  and  savings  on  their  energy  bills. This  service,  already  operational  in  the  Netherlands, France  and  Belgium,  is  now  to  be  rolled  out  in  other European  countries.  In  France  (Tokai1)  and  Germany (Tokai2), Renault is developing an original and innovative solution called Advanced Battery Storage. Operational in Douai, Flins and Elverlingsen, it consists in using batteries of electric  vehicles  to  support  the  development  of renewable  energy  and  stabilize  the  electricity  grid  while improving  battery  warranty  costs.  The  Mobility  House, Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, Demeter and Mitsui are partners in this project. Also noteworthy is the creation in 2013 of start-up Gireve, which has developed a leading interoperability service platform for charging infrastructure operators to facilitate roaming for electric vehicle  drivers.  Renault,  CNR,  Caisse  des  D\u00e9p\u00f4ts,  EDF, Enedis and Demeter are partners in this company.\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## Alliance Ventures\n\nEstablished in January 2018, Alliance Ventures is a strategic venture  capital  fund  operated  by  the  Renault-NissanMitsubishi  Alliance,  a  strategic  alliance  that  is  among  the leaders in the zero-emission vehicle sector and is developing cutting-edge  technologies  with  the  ambition  of  offering advanced autonomous driving and connectivity features on a wide range of affordable vehicles.\n\nThe  fund,  which  was  launched  in  2018  with  an  initial investment  of  $200  million,  is  located  in  Amsterdam, where  it  targets  innovative  technologies  and  business models in the fields of new mobility, autonomous driving, connected services, electric vehicles and 'Enterprise 2.0' throughout the world.\n\nBy leveraging the business expertise and opportunities of one  of  the  world's  largest  automotive  alliances,  Alliance Ventures aims to support innovation and targets strategic investments,  at  all  stages  of  development,  in  start-ups developing disruptive technologies or businesses.\n\nAlliance Ventures has announced investments in a dozen holdings, including:\n\n- \u25cf WeRide.ai, a leader in autonomous driving, aims to achieve a large-scale commercial deployment of fully autonomous (Level  4)  vehicles  for  the  general  public.

AVTOVAZ\n\nAt the end of 2021, Renault and Rostec finalized the capital restructuring  operations  of  AVTOVAZ  initiated  in  2016  as\n\n## 1.1.6 Sales financing\n\nRCI  Bank  and  Services  offers  financing  solutions  and services  to  facilitate  access  to  automotive  mobility  for Alliance  customers.  As  a  partner  who  cares  for  all  its customers,  RCI  Bank  and  Services  builds  innovative financing services to create sustainable mobility for all.\n\n## 1.1.6.1. Customized offers for each of type of customer\n\nFor Private customers,  we  propose  offers  for  financing and services that are appropriate for their projects and their  usage  patterns,  to  facilitate  and  enhance  their driving  experience  throughout  their  entire  automotive mobility  adventure.

Savings bank activity: a pillar of corporate refinancing\n\nLaunched  in  2012,  the  savings  deposits  business  is present in seven markets: France, Germany, Austria, the UK, Brazil, Spain and, since July 2021, the Netherlands.\n\nSavings deposits are a key instrument in the diversification of the Group's sources of refinancing for\n\npart of a new stage of the partnership, while the company confirmed its commercial and financial recovery.\n\nThis  involved  Rostec's  write-off  of  a  20.6  billion  ruble loan  to  strengthen  AVTOVAZ's  equity  capital  and  the creation of a new joint entity in Russia.\n\nFollowing these transactions, the percentages of interest of Renault and Rostec in the new entity, LADA Auto Holding LLC,  remain  virtually  unchanged  at  the  end  of  2021,  with Renault holding 67.61% and Rostec 32.39% of the capital of the joint entity, the sole shareholder of AVTOVAZ.\n\nIn parallel, Alliance Rostec  Auto  BV,  which  was established in 2012 in the Netherlands, will be wound up.\n\nits operations. Deposits collected came to \u20ac21 billion, or approximately  47%  of  net  assets  at  the  end  of December  2021 1 .\n\n## 1.1.6.3. 4,000 employees active in 36 countries\n\nNearly  4,000  employees  are  fully  committed  to  the success of our 'together4 customers' strategic plan as well as Groupe Renaut's Renaulution.\n\nRCI Bank and Services focuses on three key priorities:\n\n- \u25cf offering a digital path to our customers by developing a fluid, single-channel customer experience;\n- \u25cf facilitating  access  to  cars  by  developing  usage-based leasing offers in addition to traditional financing products;\n- \u25cf strengthening and optimizing our business model.\n\nTo achieve all these objectives, RCI Bank and Services is developing new, more cross-functional working methods  that  rely  on  collective  intelligence  while encouraging risk-taking.\n\nTo  best  meet  the  needs  of  Mobilize,  RCI  Bank  and Services  has  created  an  organization  that  mirrors  the organization of the new Renault Group business unit. As part  of  our  strategic  plan,  and  building  on  nearly  100 years  of  car  financing  expertise,  we  aim  to  develop used-car financing as well as subscription and operational leasing offers, which will enable us to have used  vehicles  at  our  disposal  in  the  future,  thus facilitating  the  development  of  our  financing  and underwriting  activity  in  this  niche.  In  this  context, exposure to residual value risk will increase.",

Dacia  registrations  increased  by  4.0%  to 493,232 units and those of Nissan remained at 414,542  units.  As  a  result  of  a  change  in  Renault's  'from volume  to  value'  strategy,  volumes  fell  by  7.2%  to 1,543,350  units.  The  manufacturer  has  favored  the  most profitable sales channels.\n\nThe  financing  penetration  rate  of  RCI  Bank  and  Services reached 46.0% 2 , up 1.8 points from 2019, before the health crisis.\n\nRCI Bank and Services financed 1,415,841 contracts in 2021, down  6.9%  compared  with  2020.  Used  vehicle  financing grew  4.1%  compared  with  the  previous  year,  with 363,711 contracts financed.\n\nNew  financing  (excluding  cards  and  personal  loans) amounted  to  \u20ac17.8  billion,  down  0.2%  due  to  a  7.2% increase  in  average  amounts  financed.  Excluding  the negative  currency  effect  of  \u20ac92  million,  new  financing rose by 0.4%.\n\nAverage  performing  assets  (APA)  related  to  the  Retail Customer  business  amounted  to  \u20ac37.6  billion  in  2021. Excluding the negative exchange rate effect of -\u20ac59.1 million, they increased slightly by 0.2%, thanks to the good level of new financing in 2021 in a still constrained environment.\n\nAverage  performing  assets  related  to  the  Network business amounted to \u20ac7.1 billion, down -23.4% as a result of  the  impact  of  the  semiconductor  shortage  on  vehicle manufacturing  and  the  strategy  of  optimizing  network vehicle stocks implemented by the Renault Group brands. Overall, average performing assets amounted to \u20ac44.8 billion, a decrease of -4.6% compared with the end of 2020.\n\nA pillar of the group's strategy, the number of services sold over  2021  represents  4.7  million  insurance  and  service\n\n- 1 Excluding the negative currency effect of \u20ac92 million.\n- 2 Overall penetration rate excluding associates and joint ventures: Russia (RN Bank), Turkey and India.\n\ncontracts, up by 2.1%, of which 72% are associated with the customer and vehicle use-related services.\n\nThe Europe region remains the core business of RCI Bank and  Services,  with  new  financing  (excluding  cards  and personal loans) amounting to \u20ac15.4 billion, up 1.1% on 2020 and accounting for 87% of the group's new financing. The growth is concentrated in Italy and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Americas region recorded growth in new financing by 8.6%  compared  with  2020  at  \u20ac1.1  billion.  The  growth  is concentrated  in  Colombia  and  Argentina,  while  Brazil remains heavily impacted by the health crisis.\n\nNew  financing  in  the  Africa/Middle  East/India/Pacific region  totaled  \u20ac0.9  billion,  down  21.7%  from  2020. The  decrease  is  linked  to  the  38%  drop  in  sales  by manufacturers in South Korea, although the commercial performance  of  the  RCI  subsidiary  remains  very  good, with a 59.2% penetration rate.\n\nNew  financing  in  the  Eurasia  region  amounted  to \u20ac0.4 billion, down 8.3% on the previous year, reflecting the performance of Turkey, where new financing fell by 31.7% to \u20ac133.4 million. At the same time, new financing in Russia rose by 13.4% to \u20ac239.8 million, including \u20ac42.8 million for the LADA brand.\n\n## New financing contracts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n01",

The contribution of the Services activities to the NBI represents 35.7%, up 2.2 points compared with 2020.\n\nOperating  costs  amount  to  \u20ac570  million,  a  decline  of \u20ac15 million compared with 2020. RCI Bank and Services is fully  in  line  with  Renault  Group's  plan  to  reduce  fixed costs.  Due  to  the  sharp  drop  in  Dealer  APAs  (-23.4%), operating costs as a percentage of assets amounted to 1.27%, an increase of 3 points compared to 2020.\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  for  the  Customer  business  (financing  for private  and  business  customers)  is  0.26 %  of  APA  in  2021 compared with 0.89 % of APA at the end of 2020. This very good  level  is  explained  by  the  improvement  in  risk parameters  and  by  a  return  to  normal  in  the  recovery process. These had been negatively impacted by the strict lockdowns in 2020,  particularly  in  France,  Italy,  Brazil  and Spain. The update of the IFRS 9 forward-looking provisioning resulted in an allocation of \u20ac3.0 million in 2021 compared to an allocation of \u20ac66.8 million in 2020.\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  on  the  Networks  business  (dealer financing)  totaled  -0.52%  (reversal  of  provision)  of  the APA at the end of 2021 compared with an allocation of 0.18% at the end of 2020. This improvement is related to the  decrease  in  network  outstandings  and  also  to  the updating of the IFRS 9 forward-looking provisioning, with a  release  of  \u20ac14.5  million  over  2021  compared  with  an allocation of \u20ac22.7 million over 2020.\n\nThe total cost of risk stands at 0.14% of APA compared with 0.75% at the end of 2020.\n\nPre-tax  income  stood  at  \u20ac1,194  million  compared  with \u20ac1,003 million at the end of 2020. This increase is mainly due to  the  improvement  in  the  cost  of  risk.  Consolidated  net income  -  parent  company  shareholders'  share  -  reached \u20ac846 million in 2021, compared with \u20ac787 million at the end of 2020.",

The semiconductor shortage and the new optimization policy for vehicle inventories led to a decrease in outstanding Network Credit. At the end of December 2021, net assets reached \u20ac45 billion, compared with \u20ac47.2 billion at the end of December 2020 (-4.7%).\n\nConsolidated  equity  amounted  to  \u20ac6,222  million  compared with \u20ac6,273 million at the end of December 2020 (-0.8%).\n\n## Solvency\n\nThe  total  capital  ratio 1 came  to  17.68%  at  the  end  of December  2021  (Core  Equity  Tier  One  of  14.76%),  versus 19.83% at the end of December 2020 (Core Equity Tier One of 17.34%).\n\nThe  changes  in  the  CET1  ratio  are  mainly  due  to  the normalization of the level of equity following the \u20ac931 million payout in October, with the \u20ac846 million in net income almost offset by a forecast dividend of \u20ac800 million. The change in the  Risk  Exposure  Amount  (REA) 2 (-\u20ac1,282  million)  is  mainly 3 results  from  a  decrease  in  on-balance  sheet  exposures partially offset by an increase  in off-balance  sheet exposures 4 and  by  a  decrease  in  exposure  related  to  CVA and Operational Risk.\n\n## Financial policy\n\nThe decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and the United  States  has  allowed  governments  to  restore  nearnormal  economic  activity  in  2021.  Fueled  by  soaring energy  prices  and  supply  chain  tensions,  inflation  was  a key concern for investors in the second half of the year.\n\nInflation  figures  reached  a  10-year  high  in  the  euro  zone (+4.9% annualized in November, following increases of 1.8% and  2.8%  in  the  second  and  third  quarters  respectively), leading to a rise in long-term interest rates. Growth in global economic activity is slowing, partly due to persistent supply bottlenecks.  The  slowdown  in  growth  momentum  also reflects  a  normalization  from  the  post-COVID-19  rebound, with  base  effects  from  reopenings  fading  and  support measures being reduced.\n\nIn the United States, the economic recovery slowed down in  the  second  half  of  the  year  (annualized  growth  in  the third  quarter  of  2.3%  compared  with  6.7%  in  the  second quarter  of  2021)  due  to  supply  chain  constraints  and  the sharp increase in cases attributable to the delta variant. COVID-19  cases  increased  at  the  beginning  of  the  third quarter,  leading  to  decreased  consumer confidence and decreased spending, particularly in vulnerable sectors.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  December  15,  the  US  Federal  Reserve formalized the change in its monetary policy and showed its  determination  to  reduce  price  increases,  recognizing that the current inflation phenomenon (5.3% annualized in the third quarter, following increases of 1.9% and 4.8% in the first and second quarters respectively) can no longer be considered transitory. Starting in January, the tapering of monetary easing will be doubled, and purchases will be reduced by \u20ac30 billion, with a target date for the definitive end  of  the  economic  support  program  in  March.  It maintained its Fed Funds rate target at 0-0.25% but now expects three rate hikes of 25 bps each in 2022.\n\nThe  European  Central  Bank  has  maintained  its  broadly accommodative policy, believing that the inflation peak is temporary and that inflation will return to around 2% in the next  two  years.  The  ECB  has  left  its  main  policy  rate unchanged at  0%  and  does  not  expect  to  raise  it  in  the\n\n- 1 Ratio including interim profits net of forecast dividends, after approval by the regulator in accordance with Article 26 (2) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.\n- 2 Risk Exposure Amount: RWEA (Credit Risk) + CVA and Operational Risk.\n- 3 Other factors: decrease in RWEA due to improved asset quality in the advanced model and slight increase due to the implementation of new internal models following the implementation of the new definition of default.\n- 4 The increase in vehicle delivery times has led to an increase in financing offers awaiting disbursement, which are accounted for off balance sheet.\n\nI\n\n01",

It announced a further reduction in its bond purchases  while  promising  to  maintain  significant support for the economy in 2022. Purchases of securities under  the  Pandemic  Emergency  Purchase  Programme (PEPP) launched in March 2020 will continue to decline in the coming months and cease completely at the end of March 2022. Asset Purchase Programme (APP) purchases  will  be  doubled  in  the  second  quarter  to \u20ac40 billion per month before falling back to \u20ac30 billion in the third quarter and \u20ac20 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\nUnexpectedly, the Bank of England (BoE) raised its key interest  rate  by  15  bps  to  0.25%  at  its  December  policy meeting.  However,  it  is  keeping  its  asset  purchase program unchanged at \u00a3895 billion.\n\nAgainst  this  background  of  high  inflation,  bond  yields have risen since the beginning of the year. At the end of December, the German 10-year sovereign bond rate rose by 39 bps over the year to -0.19%.\n\nBuoyed  by  excellent  corporate  financial  results  and expectations  of  a  return  to  inflation,  the  major  stock market indices saw strong gains in 2021, as evidenced by the  21%  rise  in  the  Euro  Stoxx  50.  Credit  spreads  were stable around levels close to the lows seen in 2019 and early  2020.  In  a  context  of  low  volatility  and  abundant liquidity,  the  IBOXX  Corporate  index  stood  at  61  bps  at the end of December 2021, compared with 74 bps at the end of 2020 and 70 at the end of 2019.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  growth  in  the  commercial  portfolio, financing  requirements  remained  modest,  and  the group took a number of initiatives to reduce its liquidity reserve, which had reached an all-time high at the end of 2020.  In  this  context,  RCI  Banque  did  not  issue  bonds and  sought  to  slow  the  pace  of  growth  in  customer deposits,  which  nevertheless  increased  by  \u20ac0.5  billion since December to \u20ac21.0 billion, representing growth of 2.6%  compared  with  15%  for  2020.  To  diversify  its funding sources, in July the group rolled out its savings business in the Netherlands through the fintech Raisin.\n\nTo prepare for the future, we renewed and upsized our retained  securitization  in  Italy  from  \u20ac1.4  billion  to \u20ac1.8  billion.  We  also  set  up  a  new  private  securitization program  to  refinance  the  residual  values  of  finance\n\n- 1 Term Funding Scheme for SMEs (TFSME).\n- 2 Since 2021 and in accordance with the regulator's guidelines (2018 IRRBB Guidelines), the magnitude of rate shocks depends on the currency. Over 2021, the rate shocks for the following currencies were +100 bps for EUR, CHF, KRW, GBP, PLN, MAD, HUF, JPY, USD and SKK; +150 bps for SEK and DKK; +200 bps for CZK and RON; +300 bps for BRL; and +500 bps for ARS and RUB.\n- 3 Foreign exchange position excluding equity investments in subsidiaries.\n\nleases in  France.  This  program,  which  is  currently  used for a symbolic amount, can be increased and represents a  potential  new  source  of  secure  financing  for  the company.  In  the  second  half  of  2021,  a  new  public securitization  program  was  set  up  in  the  UK.  The \u00a3750 million of self-subscribed senior debt is expected to be  eligible  for  Bank  of  England's  long-term  monetary policy  operations,  allowing  RCI  Bank  UK  to  access  the Term Funding Scheme (TFSME) 1 and diversify its liquidity reserve. Lastly, RCI Banque placed a public securitization backed by vehicle loans in Germany and issued  \u20ac900  million  of  senior  securities  (of  which \u20ac200 million were self-subscribed).\n\n- \u25cf These  resources,  together  with  \u20ac4.3  billion  of  undrawn confirmed bank lines, \u20ac3.3 billion of eligible collateral for ECB monetary policy operations and \u20ac6.6 billion of High Quality  Liquid  Assets  (HQLA),  enable  RCI  Banque  to maintain the financing granted to its customers for more than  12  months  without  access  to  external  liquidity.  At December  31,  2021,  RCI  Banque's  liquidity  reserve (European  scope)  stood  at  \u20ac14.4  billion.  This  controlled reduction of \u20ac2.2 billion compared with the end of 2020 also makes it possible to reduce the cost of carrying cash surpluses.  The  liquidity  reserve  nevertheless  remains significantly above internal targets.\n\nRCI  Banque's  overall  sensitivity  to  interest  rate  risk remained below the group's limit of \u20ac70 million.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, a parallel rise in rates 2 would have an impact on the group's net interest income (NII) of:\n\n- \u25cf -\u20ac0.9 million in EUR;\n- \u25cf -\u20ac0.8 million in BRL;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 0.8 million in KRW;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 0.3 million in GBP;\n- \u25cf -\u20ac1.7 million in PLN;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac 0.3 million in CHF.\n\nThe absolute sensitivity values in each currency totaled \u20ac8.6 million.\n\nThe RCI Banque group's consolidated foreign exchange position 3 totaled \u20ac4.2 million.",

(Mobility  as  an  Industry),  was  able  to accelerate synergies, simplify the decision-making chain, clarify  existing  offers  and  create  new  ones,  with  the launch on  January 14, 2021, of the new Mobilize Business Unit , which now brings together all services (financial with RCI Bank and Services, Energy, Mobility and data).\n\n## Mobilize's offerings\n\nMobilize  offers  flexible  mobility  services  for  people  and goods, for individuals, companies, operators and territories.\n\nMobilize  simplifies  access  to  new  mobility  through  a comprehensive, usage-based offering ranging from mobility solutions  to  energy  and  data.  It  thus  encourages  the\n\necological transition and contributes to the achievement of Renault Group's carbon neutrality objectives.\n\nMobilize includes:\n\n- \u25cf mobility  solutions  with  100%  electric  vehicles,  designed specifically  for  shared  mobility,  car-sharing  solutions (Zity by Mobilize, Mobilize share, etc.) and services  related  to  the  use  of  these  vehicles  (payment solutions, digital platform, insurance, etc.);\n- \u25cf energy services to facilitate  the  deployment  of  electric vehicles: design, installation and  maintenance  of charging-station solutions with 'Mobilize Power Solutions'  or  'Mobilize  Charge  Pass',  a  European charging card that locates and gives access to  260,000 charging stations throughout Europe, with a single payment system;\n- \u25cf solutions  to  extend  the  life  cycle  of  vehicles  and batteries  within  the  Flins  Re-Factory  to  support  the energy transition.\n\nThese  solutions  can  be  combined  within  the  territories  to help them achieve carbon neutrality, as is already the case in  the  Smart  Islands,  in  Europe  (Porto-Santo,  Belle-\u00cele-enMer, Ile d'Yeu, etc.), and in Brazil (Fernando de Noronha).\n\n## 1.1.8 Management bodies\n\n## 1.1.8.1.

For  more  than  20  years,  this  partnership  has offered  a  unique,  pragmatic  and  agile  model,  always able to evolve and integrate new projects and partners. Extended  to  Mitsubishi  group,  it  forms  the  largest automotive alliance in the world.\n\n## 1.2.2 History\n\nOn  March  27,  1999,  Renault  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.  Ltd ('Nissan')  entered  into  the  founding  agreement  of  the Alliance, the Alliance and Equity Participation Agreement (the  'AEPA').  Under  the  provisions  of  the  AEPA,  Renault acquired  a  36.8%  stake  in  Nissan's  share  capital  and subscribed for share subscription warrants that enabled it  to increase its stake first to 39.9% and then to 44.4% of Nissan's  capital.  For  its  part,  Nissan  was  given  the opportunity to acquire a stake in Renault in the future.\n\nNissan's  turnaround  and  the  Alliance's  rapid  success led  the  partners  to  take  a  new  step  forward  by accelerating  the  implementation  of  their  financial agreements, and further institutionalizing their commercial and industrial cooperation.\n\nAccordingly, on December 20, 2000, Renault and Nissan entered into the Alliance's second framework agreement,  the  'Alliance  Master  Agreement'  (the 'AMA'), which was reiterated and updated on March 28, 2002, in the 'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' (the 'RAMA').\n\nUnder the AMA  and then the RAMA, Renault strengthened its stake in Nissan, and Nissan acquired a 15% stake in Renault's share capital:\n\n- \u25cf on March 1, 2002, Renault increased its stake in Nissan from 36.8% to 44.4%; on April 6, 2010, a share exchange agreement  between  Renault,  Nissan  and  Daimler resulted  in  Renault's  stake  in  Nissan  decreasing  from 44.4%  to  43.4%  at  the  same  time  as  Daimler  entered the capital of Renault and Nissan; and\n- \u25cf on March 29, 2002, and May 28, 2002, Nissan increased its stake  in  Renault  to  15%  through  two  capital increases reserved to Nissan Finance Co. Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Nissan.\n\nThe  Alliance  has  proven  its  leadership  in  zero-emission vehicles  and  is  developing  the  innovative  technologies  of tomorrow's autonomous, connected and affordable vehicles.\n\nThe Alliance aims to create value for each partner and for all stakeholders (employees, customers, suppliers, etc.).\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  233-31  of  the  French  Commercial Code, the Renault shares held by Nissan Finance Co. Ltd. are  not  taken  into  account  in  the  calculation  of  the quorum, and do not confer voting rights, i.e., the voting rights  attached  to  such  shares  cannot  be  exercised  at Annual General Meetings.\n\nIn application of the RAMA, Renault-Nissan B.V. ('RNBV') was formed on March 28, 2002. This Amsterdam-based company  has  been  owned  equally  by  Renault  and Nissan  since  2002.  It  was  formed  to  coordinate  the common activities  on  a  global  scale  and  contribute  to the  preparation of the Alliance's strategy and mid and long-term  planning  (see  section  1.2.3.2  'Powers  of RNBV').\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  increase  by  the  French  State's stake in the share capital of Renault in 2015 and then the introduction  of  double  voting  rights,  the  Board  of Directors  of  Renault  authorized,  on  December  11,  2015, the  signing  of  the  following  agreements,  which  the Annual General Meeting approved on April 29, 2016:\n\n- \u25cf a  governance agreement entered into on February 4, 2016, between Renault and the French State, aimed at restricting  the  free  exercise  of  the  French  State's voting  rights  for  certain  decisions  submitted  to Renault's Annual General Meeting.\n- This agreement  is  described  in  section  6.2.6.2 'Shareholders'  agreements  on  shares  and  voting rights of the Company; and\n- \u25cf a third amendment  to  the  RAMA,  signed  on December  11,  2015,  between  Renault  and  Nissan  that enshrines  in  particular  the  constant  practice  of  noninterference of Renault in the governance of Nissan.",

On that occasion, and in accordance  with  applicable  regulations,  Renault  bought back 1,400,000 shares (i.e.,  10%  of  the  shares  sold  by  the French  State)  with  the  aim  of  implementing  an  offer reserved  for  employees  and  former  employees  of  the Group.\n\nThe  agreements  concluded  between  with  the  French State and Nissan remain in force.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn  October  20,  2016,  Nissan,  which  is  43.4%  owned  by Renault,  acquired  a  34%  stake  in  Mitsubishi  Motors,  thus becoming its largest shareholder.\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nOn March 12, 2019, Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi Motors formed  the  Alliance  Operating  Board,  the  body  that oversees  operations  and,  in  practice,  performs  the governance  functions  of  the  Alliance,  signaling  a  new beginning for the world's leading automotive alliance.\n\nIn 2020, the three partner companies reaffirmed that the Alliance  is  essential  for  strategic  growth  and  improving their  respective  competitiveness.  Thus,  on  May  27,  2020, the  Alliance  announced  the  adoption  of  a  new  business model for cooperation.\n\nAlliance  partners  use  the  leader-follower  model  to enhance  the  efficiency  and  competitiveness  of  vehicles and technologies.\n\nEach member becomes a reference in the regions where it has the best strategic assets, and acts as a facilitator and provider of support for the competitiveness of the others.\n\nThe  three  members  build  on  the  Alliance's  existing strengths,  such  as  joint  purchasing,  by  leveraging  their respective leadership positions and geographic strengths to support their partners' development.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Mitsubishi  Motors  by  Nissan  enabled the expanded  Alliance  to  consolidate  its  industrial position.\n\n## 1.2.3 Functioning of the Alliance in 2021\n\n## 1.2.3.1. The Alliance Operating Board\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board, created on March 12, 2019, is in  charge  of  operational  coordination  between  Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and will take new initiatives that will create value for their respective shareholders and employees.\n\nThis new  Alliance  Operating  Board  comprises  four members, appointed by Renault (two members, including the Chairman of the Alliance Operating Board), by Nissan (1 member), and by Mitsubishi Motors (1 member).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Alliance Operating Board was composed  of  Jean-Dominique  Senard,  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  of  Renault  and  Chairman  of  the Alliance Operating Board, Makoto Uchida, Chief Executive Officer of Nissan, Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Renault,  and  Takao  Kato,  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Mitsubishi Motors (following the resignation and death of Osamu Masuko in August 2020).\n\nThe decisions of the Alliance Operating Board are made by  all  members  by  consensus.  The  Alliance  Operating Board  meets  monthly,  and  as  often  as  the  Alliance's interest requires, in Paris or Yokohama, or by videoconference when necessary.\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board oversees the operations and performs the governance functions of the Alliance. In any event,  RNBV  continues  to  exist  and  supports  the  Alliance Operating  Board,  particularly  for  decisions  and  proposals that fall within the power of RNBV under the RAMA.\n\nThe Alliance Operating Board's General Secretary, V\u00e9ronique  Sarlat-Depotte,  appointed  in  April  2021,  is tasked  with  coordinating  and  facilitating  the  Alliance's major  projects  launched  to  accelerate  the  operating efficiency of the respective companies. and reports to the Alliance Operating Board.\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board  is  assisted  by  specific operating committees that make recommendations on new sources of value creation between the three carmakers.\n\nDuring  2021,  Alliance  members  were  always  at  the forefront  of  the  industry  in  terms  of  their  performance, products,  technologies  and  markets,  while  continuing  to benefit  from  joint  purchasing  and  development.  During the  AOB  from  May  to  July,  three  Alliance  Strategy  Days were  implemented  to  share  product  opportunities,  take stock of platforms, the EV strategy, electronic equipment packaging, and major technologies such as batteries.\n\nOpportunities  were  clearly  identified,  the  work  plan  was established,  and  technical  roadmaps  were  recognized and shared.\n\nA  global  product  plan  for  2025  (ICE  +  xHEV  +  BEV),  80% based on common platforms, is being rolled out, as is the BEV-specific product plan, increased to 90% by common platforms (vs. 0% at the end of 2020).\n\nRegarding  the  future  battery  strategy,  the  Alliance  is converging  towards  shared  common  technology/cost/ capacity  roadmaps.  For  a  next  generation  of  electric vehicles,  the  Alliance  has  selected  a  single  supplier  to produce its  batteries  for  Renault  and  Nissan  in  France,  the UK, Japan and China.\n\nI\n\n01",

In Europe, for  example,  Renault  is  working  closely  with  MMC  on several  cross-badging  projects  in  the  B-segment  with regular follow-up meetings and milestones.\n\nAn 'Alliance Com' event was held on January 27, 2022, during  which  Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors announced a  common  roadmap  for  2030 (described below) dedicated  to  electric  vehicles  and  smart  and connected mobility, sharing investments for the benefit of its three members and their customers.\n\n## Alliance vision for 2030\n\n## Moving together for the benefit of each: the Leader-Follower strategy\n\nThe  Alliance  members  have  developed  a  'smart differentiation'  methodology  that  defines  the  desired level  of  commonality  for  each  vehicle,  integrating several parameters  of  possible  pooling,  such  as platforms,  production  plants,  powertrains  or  vehicle segment.  This  is  supplemented  and  enhanced  by  a stricter approach to design and upper-body differentiation.  For  example,  the  common  platform  for the  C  and  D  segment  will  carry  five  models  from  three brands  of  the  Alliance  (Nissan  Qashqai  and  X-Trail, Mitsubishi Outlander, Renault Austral and an upcoming seven-seater  SUV).  Strengthening  this  process,  the Alliance  members  will  enhance  usage  of  common platforms in the coming years from 60% today to more than  80%  of  its  combined  90  models  in  2026.  This  will allow  each  company  to  deepen  their  focus  on  their customers' needs, their best models and core markets, while also extending innovations across the Alliance, at a lower cost.\n\nAs  part  of  this,  Mitsubishi  Motors  will  reinforce  its presence in Europe with two new models, among them the New ASX based on Renault best-sellers.\n\n## Five common EV platforms: the largest global offer of the industry\n\nRenault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  have  pioneered  the EV market, with more than \u20ac10 billion already invested in the field of electrification. In the main markets (Europe, Japan, the US, China), 15 Alliance plants already produce parts, motors, batteries for 10 EV models on the streets. More  than  one  million  electric  cars  have  been  sold  to date and 30 billion kilometers driven.\n\nBuilding  on  this  unique  expertise,  the  Alliance  is accelerating with a total \u20ac23 billion more investment in the next five years on electrification, leading to 35 new EV models by 2030.\n\n90% of these models will be based on five common EV platforms, covering most markets, in all major regions:\n\n- \u25cf CMF-AEV ,  the most affordable platform in the world, is the base for the new Dacia Spring.\n- \u25cf KEI-EV , (mini vehicle) platform  family  for  ultracompact EVs.\n- \u25cf LCV-EV , family platform family for professional customers,  as  the  base  for  the  Renault  Kangoo  and Nissan Town Star.\n- \u25cf CMF-EV, the global, flexible EV platform will  be on the roads in a few weeks as the base for the Nissan Ariya and  Renault  Megane  E-TECH  Electric.  The  CMF-EV platform,  with  its  technological  innovations  and  the potential  offered  by  its  modularity,  is  a  benchmark platform for  a  new  generation  of  electric  vehicles  for the  Alliance  partners.  The  platform  has  been  created to integrate and optimize all the elements specific to a 100%  electric powertrain, hosting a new, highperformance motor and an ultra-thin battery. By 2030, more  than  15  models  will  be  based  on  the  CMF-EV platform,  with  up  to  1.5  million  cars  produced  on  this platform per year.\n- \u25cf CMF-BEV , the  most  competitive  compact  electric platform in the  world,  to  be  launched  in  2024. It  provides  up  to  400  km  range;  its  aerodynamics performances are outstanding, helping reduce cost by 33%  and  power  consumption  by  more  than  10% compared with the current Renault ZOE. It  will  be  the base  for  250,000  vehicles  a  year  under  the  Renault, Alpine and Nissan brands. Among the vehicles are the Renault R5 and the new compact EV that will replace the Nissan Micra. Designed by Nissan and engineered by Renault, the new  model  is  planned  to  be manufactured  at  Renault  ElectriCity:  the  electric industrial center in northern France.",

Based  on  its  deep expertise  and  unique  experience  as  a  pioneer  in  battery technology, Nissan will lead innovations in this area that will benefit all Alliance members.\n\nASSB will double the energy density versus current liquid lithium-ion  batteries.  Charging  time  will  also  be  greatly reduced to one third, enabling customers to make longer trips with more comfort.\n\nThe aim is to mass produce ASSB by mid-2028 and, in the future beyond that, to realize cost parity with ICE vehicles by bringing costs down  further  to  $65  per  kWh, accelerating the global shift to EVs.\n\nThe Alliance also has a state-of-the art battery management  system.  Unlike  others  in  the  industry,  the Alliance has chosen to control 100% of its hardware and software,  benefiting  from  very  valuable  predictive  data, allowing for monitoring the state of health of the battery and improving technology.\n\nThe Alliance is working with strategic partners to offer the best  solutions  to  customers  for  public  charging.  Mobilize Power  Solutions  provides  to  B2B  customers  a  complete end-to-end  service  including  project  design,  installation, maintenance and management of optimized recharging infrastructure  and  all  related  services  to  meet  their business needs.\n\nA recent agreement is with Ionity via the Alliance Emobility Service  Provider  Plug  Surfing,  which  will  allow  its customers  to  access  at  preferential  pricing  to  the  Ionity ultra-fast charging network in Europe.\n\nWith  more  than  10  years'  experience  in  the  EV  business, Alliance members have deep knowledge that allows them to  be  ahead  of  the  competition  in  optimizing  battery reuse,  notably  with  second-life  battery  applications,\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\nrecycling and achieving efficient and sustainable solutions over the full battery life cycle.\n\n## 25 million cars connected to the Alliance Cloud by 2026: the best-in-class digital experience for customers\n\nIntelligent  and  connected  mobility  are  critical  areas  for increased shared innovation across the Alliance.\n\nWith  20  years'  experience  in  ADAS  (advanced  driverassistance systems) and autonomous driving, the Alliance keeps  improving  real-world  driving  safety,  convenience, and  enjoyment  by  delivering  innovations  in  intelligent vehicle  and  driver-assistance  technologies,  with  an example being Nissan's award-winning ProPILOT system.\n\nWith  shared  platforms  and  electronics,  by  2026  Alliance members expect to have more than 10 million vehicles on the  road  across  45  Alliance  models  equipped  with autonomous driving systems.\n\nToday,  3  million  vehicles  are  already  connected  to  the Alliance Cloud with ongoing data exchanges.\n\nBy 2026, more than 5 million Alliance cloud systems will be delivered  per  year,  with  a  total  of  25  million  connected cars on the road. The Alliance will also be the first global, mass-market OEM to introduce the Google ecosystem in its cars.\n\nUnder  Renault's  leadership,  the  Alliance  is  developing  a common  centralized  electrical  and  electronic  architecture converging electronics hardware and software applications to offer maximum  benefits  and  an  optimal  level  of performance.\n\nThe  Alliance  will  launch  its  first  full  software  defined vehicle by 2025. With this vehicle, the Alliance will improve the performance of its cars 'Over The Air' throughout their life cycle.  This  will  mean  greater  value  added  for customers, in particular with the integration of the car into their  digital  ecosystem  to  offer  them  a  personalized experience, new enhanced services and reduced maintenance costs. This will also allow Alliance members to  boost vehicle resale values. In addition, these vehicles will  be  able  to  communicate  with  connected  objects, users,  and  infrastructure,  opening  new fields  of  value  for the Alliance companies.\n\nThe  Alliance's  unique  digital  experience  will  be  the gateway to an unprecedented amount of data, paving the way  to  the  automotive  industry's  next  frontier,  with Renault  Group,  Nissan  Motors  and  Mitsubishi  Motors positioned at the forefront of this revolution.\n\nI\n\n01",

(RNBV)\n\nSince  2002,  under  the  RAMA,  RNBV  has  had  decisionmaking and recommendation powers that it exercises in consensus  with  each  partner  and  in  compliance  with their interests.\n\nThese  decision-making  and  recommendation  powers are exercised in areas that affect Alliance-wide strategy and planning.\n\nFurthermore, RNBV has control over Alliance Purchasing Organization  (APO),  created  in  April  2001  under  the corporate name Renault-Nissan Purchasing Organization (RNPO), of which RNBV has been the sole shareholder since June 24, 2003.\n\nRNBV does not intervene in the operational management of Renault or Nissan and does not share in the  profits  or  bear  the  associated  risks.  Operational decisions are made and implemented by each company to the extent that such company is affected by them.\n\nThis  company  is  not  consolidated  due  to  its  nonsignificant  nature  in  accordance  with  the  accounting principles  described  in  note  2-C  of  the  consolidated financial statements presented in section 5.2.2.6.2.\n\n## Powers of RNBV\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  RAMA  and  Article  15  of  the Renault s.a.s articles of association, Renault and Nissan have  delegated  certain  powers  to  RNBV  pursuant  to  a management agreement signed on April 17, 2002, for an initial period of 10 years (the 'Management Agreement').\n\nIn April 2012, the Management Agreement was renewed for  another  10-year  period  pursuant  to  an  agreement entitled Renewal  Agreement  of  the  Management Agreement,  the  provisions  of  which  are  identical  to those  of  the  Management  Agreement  (the  'Renewal Agreement of the Management Agreement'). Renault's shareholders  were  informed  of  this  at  Renault's  2012 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Management Agreement will expire on April 16, 2022. Any  renewal  of  the  Management  Agreement  will  be communicated to the Renault shareholders.\n\nAt the end of the Management Agreement, RNBV will still have the decision-making and recommendation powers listed in the RAMA. However, these decisions will no longer be directly applicable within Renault s.a.s. and will  have  to  be  formally  ratified  by  the  governance bodies of Renault s.a.s. on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe  list  of  RNBV  powers  under  the  RAMA  is  restrictive and has not changed since the creation of the Alliance.\n\nFirst  and  foremost,  RNBV  has  decision-making  powers that cover:\n\n- \u25cf adoption of 3, 5 and 10 year plans (strategic Company projects, with quantified data);\n- \u25cf approval of product plans (phase of strategic projects corresponding to the design, manufacturing and sale of current or future products, vehicles and components);\n- \u25cf decisions  concerning  the  sharing  of  products  and powertrains  (such  as  platforms,  vehicles,  gearboxes, engines and other components);\n- \u25cf principles of financial policy, including:\n- \u25cf discount  rates  used  for  profitability  studies  and hurdle  rates,  applicable  to  future  models  and investments,\n- \u25cf risk management rules and the policy applicable to them,\n- \u25cf financing and cash management rules,\n- \u25cf debt leverage strategy;\n- \u25cf management  of  common  subsidiaries,  and  the creation,  modification,  steering  and  disbandment  of Cross-Company  Teams  (CCTs)  and  Functional  Task Teams  (FTTs).  These  teams  operate  in  all  the  main sectors  and  areas  of  activity  and  are  tasked  with exploring new synergies between the two companies. Team managers report regularly to the Alliance Board on the progress made in their specific area of activity; and\n- \u25cf any  other  subject  or  project  assigned  to  RNBV  on  a joint basis by Nissan and Renault.\n\nRNBV also has the exclusive power to propose a set of decisions  to  Renault  and  Nissan.  Both  manufacturers remain free to follow those proposals or not.\n\nThese proposals relate to:\n\n- \u25cf creation and scope of joint subsidiaries;\n- \u25cf supplementary financial incentive schemes for management;\n- \u25cf significant changes in scopes involving total expenditure of $100 million or more;\n- \u25cf strategic investments exceeding $500 million; and\n- \u25cf strategic cooperation between Nissan or Renault and third parties.\n\n## Governance of RNBV\n\nThe  functioning  of  the  Management  Board  of  RNBV  is described  in  Articles  14  et  seq.  of  the  RNBV  articles  of association.\n\nA French translation of the RNBV articles of association is available on the Renault website.\n\nThe composition of the Management Board of RNBV has always followed a principle of balance in the representation of Renault and Nissan.",

These  strategic  cooperations  make  it possible to increase economies of scale, accelerate growth in  new  regions,  gain  access  to  new  technologies,  share costs and jointly  fund  research  and  development of nextgeneration  vehicles  and  engines.  Existing  and  potential partners of the Alliance especially appreciate its ability to deepen collaboration over several business cycles.\n\nThe  Alliance's  most  significant  strategic  collaboration  is by far the one with the premium manufacturer Daimler in April 2010.\n\nThis cooperation is managed by a Cooperation Committee co-chaired  by  Jean-Dominique  S\u00e9nard,  Chairman  of  the Alliance  Operating  Board,  and  Ola  K\u00e4llenius,  Chairman  of the  Management  Board  of  Daimler  AG  and  CEO  of Mercedes-Benz  AG,  comprises  the  senior  executives  of Renault,  Nissan,  Mitsubishi  Motors  and  Daimler.  This committee,  which  meets  several  times  per  year,  ensures the  implementation  of  the  agreed  projects  and  makes proposals  for  new  ones.  No  specific  areas  of  potential collaboration are excluded. When teams suggest projects that could benefit all partners, they then launch feasibility studies.  If  senior  executives  and  Board  members  of  all companies agree, then the project is approved.\n\nIn  2018,  Mitsubishi  Motors  was  fully  integrated  into  the cooperation  with  Daimler.  The  cooperation  between  the Alliance  and  Daimler  now  covers  projects  developed  on three  continents.  The  key  projects  in  which  Renault  is currently participating are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf Renault and Daimler have developed a joint platform for SMART  and  TWINGO.  The  2-  and  4-seater  SMART Electric  was  launched  in  2017,  followed  by  the  Twingo Electric  in  2020.  The  electric  engines  are  being  built  at the  Renault  plant  in  Cl\u00e9on.  The  battery  of  the  electric SMART is  produced  by  a  Daimler  subsidiary,  Deutsche ACCUmotive,  in  Kamenz,  Germany,  and  the  TWINGO battery is produced in Novo Mesto (Slovenia);\n- \u25cf Renault  developed  a  small  light  commercial  vehicle based  on  KANGOO  for  Daimler.  This  vehicle,  named CITAN, has been manufactured in the Renault Maubeuge plant since 2012. The successors of KANGOO and CITAN in thermal version were launched in 2021, and the electrical version is currently being developed;\n- \u25cf the  Alliance  and  Daimler  have  jointly  developed  a direct-injection  turbocharged  small  gasoline  engine family (1 L and 1.3 L). These new, more compact engines feature state-of-the-art technology enabling improvements  in  fuel  economy,  as  well  as  significant reductions  in  emissions.  The  new  engines  debuted  in Daimler, Renault and Nissan vehicles in late 2017.\n\nI\n\n01",

By  2030,  it  aims  to reduce its CO2 emissions by 50% compared with 2010.\n\nBy  2022,  all  new  models  sold  will  have  an  electric  or electrified version, in a market that in five years' time will see 50% of vehicles sold running on electric or hybrid power.\n\n## The battery\n\nSince the announcement of its electric vehicle offensive in place since early 2007, Renault Group has been able to rely  on  recognized internal expertise (electrochemistry, materials science, thermal modeling, control electronics,  mechanical  packaging,  etc.)  to  make  the wisest choices in terms of cells, modules and lithium ion\n\n(Li-ion)  battery  packs  in  order  to  offer  solutions  in  its electric and hybrid vehicles at the best level in terms of autonomy  (energy  density),  performance  over  time (durability), reliability, safety and cost.\n\nThis upstream expertise has also extended to taking into account  the  entire  life  cycle  of  Li-ion  batteries  (from extraction of raw materials to dismantling and recycling): again,  Renault  Group  has  chosen  to  be  a  pioneer  in  this global approach and to participate in the development of more  virtuous  industrial  sectors,  as  well  as  in  the emergence of 'second life' applications for batteries.\n\nThis expertise accumulated over time has enabled Renault Group  to  build  up  particularly  effective  cooperation  with world-class cell suppliers in order to optimize the performance and cost of its batteries without compromising  safety  and  to  carry  out  -  with  a  view  to creating  ecosystems  -  promising  collaborations  on  the various  stages  of  the  life  cycle  or  on  the  emergence  of energy services associated with vehicle charging.\n\nThe  Group's  Research  and  Innovation  departments  are now  continuing  their  work  to  push  current  Li-ion technology to the limit along several lines: energy density (to further increase the vehicle's autonomy or to be able to  reduce  the  volume  of  the  battery  pack),  but  also  the charging power or the cost of  batteries  -  depending  on the uses and services targeted for each vehicle.\n\n'Post-Li-ion'  alternatives  are  also  being  looked  at,  in particular 'all-solid state' technologies ('ASSB' - All Solid State Battery').",

        "page_content": "Renault Group is the first carmaker to act on the entire life cycle of the battery .  The Group's ambition is to develop a 'made  in  France'  battery  that  is  green,  low-carbon  and responsible : up to 35% reduction in the carbon footprint of batteries by 2025.\n\nBacked  by  a  decade  of  experience,  the  Group  is accelerating  the  development  of  this  experience  with Mobilize to  increase  their  durability,  extend  their  uses, generate  additional  value  at  each  step  of  the  life  cycle and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nDuring the first life of the battery in the vehicle, the Group is  developing vehicle-to-grid (V2G)  solutions  that  enable energy  to  be  pushed  back  to  the  power  grid  from  the battery  of  an  electric  car.  Grid  operators  are  very interested in these power storage solutions brought by car battery  to  balance  load  at  all  times.  This  way,  a  car connected  8  hours  per  day  could  generate  a  value potentially up to 400 euros per year through V2G, allowing EV drivers to offset part of their annual leasing cost and Renault Group to capture recurrent profits related to car fleets.\n\nAt the end of their first life in the vehicle, batteries may still contain  around  two  thirds  of  their  capacity  and  can  be reused  for  a second  life . Mobilize  is  developing  new applications around stationary battery storage to manage punctual power needs, mobile electricity storage or generators for use in other industries. Through Mobilize, the  Group  is  pioneering  this  market  and  has  defined  a unique industrial setup to lead this market in Europe:\n\n- \u25cf the collection of end-of-life batteries with the support of its dealer network;\n- \u25cf the ability to assess their condition ,  thanks to real-time technical monitoring;\n- \u25cf the industrial capacity to refurbish batteries at competitive prices and repackage the upcoming 250,000 units of ZOE leased batteries.\n\nExpanding the value chain, the Group plans to collaborate with  car  rating  agencies  so  that  the  residual  value  of batteries  is  taken  into  account  in  used-car  market transactions  for  a  value up  to  500  euros  per  car . To reassure  owners  of  used  electric  vehicles,  Mobilize  will offer 'health  certificates' (battery  SOH),  the  extension contracts  and  trade-in  offers  made  possible  by  the connected vehicle.\n\nEnd  of  life: through  its  subsidiary  Indra  and  its  longstanding partnership with Veolia, the Group benefits from a robust know-how in EV battery collection and recycling . It has already recycled a cumulative 75 MWh of batteries, half of which in 2020 alone. To go even further, the Group is deploying  battery  retrofitting,  reuse,  dismantling  and\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\nrecycling facilities  through  its Re-Factory project in Flins with the aim of generating more than \u20ac1 billion in revenues from  these  end-of-life  and  recycling  activities  by  2030 . Going  further  in  recycling,  the  consortium  recently announced  with Solvay  and  Veolia will enable  the recovery  of  strategic  battery  materials  such  as  cobalt, nickel and lithium with a very high efficiency and batterygrade quality so that they can be reused in the production of new car batteries.\n\nEvolutions  in  its  overall  battery  collection  and  recycling process will allow Renault Group to divide the net cost of recycling by three by 2030 and secure an alternative and sustainable sourcing of battery materials at a competitive cost  for  part  of  its  needs,  while  preserving  these  natural resources.\n\n## Reducing the carbon footprint upstream:\n\nThe  Group  aims  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  from  its purchases  by  30%  (in  CO2/kg  of  material)  by  2030.  This involves:\n\n- \u25cf an agreement with Vulcan (manufacturer in Germany):  supply  of  6,000  to  17,000  metric  tons  of European zero-carbon lithium annually. Vulcan Energy will produce  battery-grade  lithium  from  renewable  energy and geothermal brine. These facilities reduce the carbon and water footprint of lithium during the production phase, which  will  allow  Renault  Group  to  avoid  300  to  700  kg  of CO2 emissions per 50 kWh battery;\n- \u25cf an agreement with Terrafame (manufacturer in Finland) to secure low-carbon and ensure the traceability  of  the  entire  supply  chain  (an  annual capacity  of  around  15  GWh).  The  carbon  footprint  of nickel sulfate produced by Terrafame is  more than 60% smaller  than  industry  average.  The  bioleaching-based production process (extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms) uses about 90% less energy  in  the  production  of  nickel  sulfate  than  the industry average.\n\nLeveraging  its 10-year  experience  in  the  electric  vehicle value chain ,  Renault  Group's battery strategy led to bold standardization  choices  within  the  Alliance  to  unleash competitiveness.  With NMC-based  chemistry (Nickel, Manganese  &  Cobalt)  and  a  unique  cell  footprint,  the Group will cover 100% of the future BEV launches across all segments .  It  will cover all ranges with up to one million electric  vehicles  Alliance-wide  by  2030.

It  is  in  this context that the Network of Experts was asked to lead a Hydrogen Technology Workshop in 2021 involving all the engineering  professions.  A  wide  range  of  topics  were covered,  from  the  ecosystem  to  the  technical  and economic  definition  of  hydrogen  systems  to  their integration into our range of vehicles. The production of this  project  and  the  conclusion  of  the  Experts  enabled the  launch  of  an  offensive  in  the  deployment  of Hydrogen projects by creating HYVIA (joint venture with the  American  Plug  Power)  but  also  the  launch  of  an ambitious strategic plan for a set of Hydrogen solutions for the next ten years.\n\nThe changes that will affect the world in the decade that begins  with  this  21 st year  of  the  21 st century  will  be  of  a nature and magnitude never before seen for the planet and  the  automotive  sector.  Market  fundamentals  and regulatory  and  technological  bases  are  or  will  all  be called  into  question.  For  our  company,  staying  in  the race means standing out by knowing and listening to our markets  -  translated  into  permanent  innovation  -  and gaining a position on new sectors of activity, with a high degree  of  scientific  and  technical  knowledge.  In  this context  where  the  mobilization  and  facilitation  of knowledge  are  increasingly  important,  the  question  of expertise has become crucial, if not vital: Identifying and then capturing the value created by knowledge to put it at  the  service  of  Renaulution  and  offer  a  competitive advantage to our company is the mission of the network of experts and especially that of the leading experts.\n\n## The network of experts\n\nThese are 50 areas of strategic expertise with a strong emphasis on engineering functions. It is organized into four levels of expertise:\n\n- \u25cf the Expert Fellow responsible for defining and ensuring the consistency of the strategic areas of expertise and coordinates  the  Experts  Leaders  network  in  order  to structure production both at the strategic level and the operational level regarding technical or methodological  innovations  and  support  for  projects under development. The collaborative work carried out during expert workshops contributes to a dynamic of shared progress for the affected business activities as regards  the  Company's  main  challenges,  which  are largely  technical  (hydrogen,  coupling  of  complex systems, additive manufacturing, etc.). The network of experts can thus be described as an agile organization serving  the  cross-business  and  the  construction  of shared  roadmaps  up  to  CEO  level  for  strategic technologies;\n- \u25cf the Expert  Leaders , each  reporting  to  a  Department Head,  are  responsible  for  their  roadmap.  Responsible for  one  of  the  50  areas  of  strategic  expertise.  They\n- structure  and  guide  their  internal  network  of  experts and use an external network consisting of universities, other manufacturers, associations, incubation structures,  etc.,  to  enable  the  Company  to  work  in  an 'extended' way;\n- \u25cf the  250 Experts are  in  charge  of  secondary  fields  of expertise,  responsible  for  benchmarks,  identifying relevant  partners  and  investing  in  the  protection  of know-how  through  patents.  They  are  responsible  in particular  for  defining  and  promoting  standards  and processes;\n- \u25cf the 500 Consultants further the state of the art in their practice,  developing  standards  on  which  the  teams can then capitalize.\n\nThe organization of the network of experts and its agile mode of operation allow the way ahead to be mapped out using a set of coherent roadmaps, the enhancement of knowledge to be accelerated through innovation and the  performance  of  operations,  thus  allowing  the business  activities  to  excel  in  their  various  areas  of expertise.\n\n## Academic partnerships\n\nRenault Group has always worked with leading schools and  the  best  academic  partners.  In  2021,  the  CIFRE campaign allowed the collection of 34 thesis subjects.\n\n## Examples of theses addressed for 2021:\n\n- \u25cf Perception  and  processing  of  data  through  machine learning for an enhanced user experience.\n- \u25cf Contextual energy optimization of a hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle.\n- \u25cf Systemic  coherence  in  the  construction  of  the abatement  cost of innovations to decarbonize mobility.\n- \u25cf Comprehensive  medium-  and  long-term  driving  risk prediction with deep neural networks.\n- \u25cf All-solid, green, inexpensive and fast-charging battery.\n- \u25cf Algorithms for firm and forecast dispatch issues.\n\n## FOCUS on a flagship collaborative project: NeVeOS to ensure the digital transition\n\nIn addition to technological developments, the Research Department  must  also  enable  Renault  Group  to anticipate  and  prepare  for  changes  in  customer  uses and  expectations  in  the  years  to  come:  changes  that could  be  rapid  and  far-reaching,  whether  towards  a different  'consumption  mode'  for  the  car  (shift  from ownership  to  use),  towards  mobility  thought  of  as  a whole and integrating the different modes of travel, or towards increased driving automation.\n\nThis role of 'guide' for the Group also includes the study of  the  business  models associated with these changes in  order  to  better  identify  the  place  that  Renault  Group could  take  in  these  areas,  particularly  within  the ecosystems of players that are bound to emerge.",

In  order  to better prepare for the technologies of tomorrow, we must be  able  to  work  with  the  best  companies  on  the  market and constantly explore new opportunities for innovation.\n\nWith regard to battery cells, the Group has chosen to:\n\n- \u25cf partner  with Envision  AESC,  which  will  develop  a gigafactory  in  Douai with  a  capacity  of  9  GWh  in  2024 aiming  at  reaching  24  GWh  by  2030.  Close  to  Renault ElectriCity,  Renault  Group's  partner  will  produce  latest technology,  cost-competitive,  low-carbon  and  safe batteries  for  electric  models,  including  the  future Renault 5;\n- \u25cf signed  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  become shareholder of the French start-up Verkor with a stake of over 20% .  The two partners intend to co-develop a highperformance  battery  suitable  for  the C  and  higher segments of the Renault range, as well as for the Alpine models. The partnership also includes the development of  a  pilot  production line in France for battery cells and\n\nmodule prototyping from 2022. In a second step, starting from 2026, Verkor aims to build the first gigafactory for high  performance  batteries  in  France,  with  an  initial capacity of 10 GWh for Renault Group, potentially rising to 20 GWh by 2030.\n\n## Electric powertrains: from sourcing to manufacturing in-house e-powertrain:\n\nRenault  Group  keeps  one  step  ahead  of  competition  by being the first OEM to develop its own e-motor - with no rare earth (no-permanent  magnets)  and  based  on electrically excited synchronous motor (EESM) technology,  along  with  its  own  reducer.  Having  already done most of the investment, the Group has been able to cut the battery cost by two over the past ten years and will divide it by two again in the upcoming decade. The Group will  gradually  embed new  technological  improvements from 2024 on  its  EESM:  stator  hairpin,  glued  motor  stack, brushless  and  hollow  rotor  shafts;  lowering  costs  and improving the efficiency of the motor.\n\nI\n\n01",

This  technology  will  first  be  applied  on  hybrid powertrains  aiming  to  reduce  the  costs  by  5%  while saving  up  to  2.5  g  CO2  on  WLTP  (for  B/C-segment passenger  car).  Renault  Group  will  be the  first  OEM  to produce axial flux e-motor on a large scale from 2025.\n\nOn  Power  Electronics,  the  Group  will  extend  its  value chain control by integrating the inverter, DC-DC converter and the on-board charger (OBC) into a unique box produced in-house. With a compact design, this One Box Project will be 800 V compliant, with fewer parts to reduce  the  cost,  and  will  be  used  across  all  platforms and  powertrains  (BEV,  HEV,  PHEV)  for  further  scale\n\neffect. Power modules for inverter, DC-DC converter and OBC  will  rely  respectively  on  silicon  carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) thanks to our strategic partnership signed with STMicroelectronics .\n\nOn  top  of  these  new  technologies,  the  Group  is  also working  on  a more  compact  e-powertrain called  the all-in-one system. This e-powertrain consists in integrating  the  e-motor,  the  reducer  and  the  power electronics  (One  Box  Project)  in  a  single  package: enabling -45% volume in total (equivalent to the volume of the current-generation Clio fuel tank), -30% cost of the overall  powertrain  (this  saving  in  value  being  the equivalent  of  the  e-motor  cost),  and -45%  on  wasted energy on WLTP giving an extra EV range of up to 20 km.\n\n## 1.3.3 Engineering performance\n\nEngineering performance is assessed at two levels:\n\n- \u25cf the ability to innovate and anticipate;\n- \u25cf its ability to standardize to reduce diversity.\n\n## Engine strategy\n\nAs part of the Renaulution strategic plan, Renault Group has  embarked  on  one  of  the  most  extreme  powertrain rationalization  exercises  in  the  automotive  industry: fewer powertrains, equipping more vehicles and covering a wider power range with increasing levels of electrification; from micro-hybrid (mHEV), full hybrid (HEV) and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) to full electric (BEV) vehicles.\n\n- In Europe,  the  number  of  powertrain  families  will decrease from 8 to 4.\n\nThanks to this strategy, Renault Group will offer a range of competitive powertrains capable of using many types of fuels, compliant  with  emission  regulations  and capable  of  achieving  our  CO2  ('CAFE')  targets  in  2025 and beyond with very limited additional investments.\n\nRenault  Group  will  rely  on  a  fully  optimized  range  of batteries: from normal range to extra-long range, based on two affordable and premium Lithium ion NMC (Nickel Manganese  Cobalt)  electrochemicals  and  using  two shared module footprints in the Alliance.\n\n## Alternative energies\n\nRenault Group is actively working on the integration of competitive hydrogen technology and the adaptation of\n\ncurrent  internal  combustion  engines  for  use  with alternative  fuels  such  as  LPG  (low-pressure  gas)  and CNG (compressed natural gas).\n\n## Hydrogen\n\nIn  January 2021, Renault Group and Plug Power Inc., the world  leader  in  fuel  cell  systems  and  hydrogen-related services,  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding (MOU), which was formalized in June with the creation of a 50/50 joint venture named HYVIA .  This  new company based in France, with its headquarters and R&D center based  in  Villiers-Saint-Frederic,  aims  to  achieve  a  30% market  share  of  hydrogen-powered  light  commercial vehicles (LCVs) in Europe by 2030.\n\nHYVIA offers a unique range of services on the market: complete  turnkey  solutions,  including  the  supply  of hydrogen vehicles, recharging stations, refueling, as well as services adapted to these new needs.\n\n## Petrol engines\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  TCe  115  (HR10DDT)  engine was  launched  on  the  Renault  Megane.  This  1-liter, 3-cylinder, turbo engine shared with Nissan (an Alliance development) is available on the Nissan Micra.\n\nRenault Group continued to roll out petrol engines that comply with the Euro 6D Full standard, including the full range  of  new  cars  to  be  launched  in  2021:  Renault Arkana & Dacia Jogger",

This unprecedented combination was launched on the new Nissan Juke, made in England\n\nThe new HR12VDV petrol engine (1.2 ltr, 3cyl, variable valve lift, direct injection, turbo) is entering its pre-industrial phase at  the  Cl\u00e9on  plant  for  a  launch  in  2022.  Intended  to  equip the next cars of the C/D range in mild hybrid (48v) as well as full hybrid for the second generation of E-TECH hybrid.\n\n## Diesel engines\n\nRenault  Group  continued  to  roll  out  diesel  engines  that comply  with  the  Euro  6D  standard,  preparing  for  the switch to Euro6d FULL for the entire LCV (N1) Euro6D FULL range in early 2022: Kangoo, Trafic and Master.\n\n## Electric powertrains (eGMP)\n\nIn November 2021, the new electric powertrain code 6AM went  into  series  production.  This  eGMP  is  intended  to power  the  upcoming  cars  based  on  the  new  CMF-EV platform for the Alliance's C/D range of electric cars. The first  such  car  for  Renault  Group  will  be  the  new electric Megane E-TECH .\n\nThis eGMP (coiled motor, radial flow) can have more than 200  patents.  Available  at  launch  with  batteries  (the thinnest  on  the  market  at  110  mm  high)  in  40  kWh  and 60 kWh capacity and an e-motor in two versions, 96 kW/ 130  HP and 160 kW/220 HP, with the potential to go up to 185 kW/252 HP.\n\nRenault  Group  has  developed  a  new  charging  system called AC3 (22kW AC / 130kW DC COMBO) based on silicon carbide (SiC) to enable super-fast charging:\n\n- \u25cf under  a  'normal'  AC  load  -  charging  up  to  22kW  -  full vehicle charging (60 kWh) can be achieved in less than 3 hours, or 130 km of range can be recovered in 1 hour;\n- \u25cf 'rapid' direct current charging: up to 130 kW DC, 80% of the range can be recovered in 30 minutes.\n\n## Platform strategy\n\nUnder  the  Renaulution  strategic  plan,  80%  of  Renault Group  vehicles  will  be  produced  on  the  4  Alliance platforms by 2025. They are CMF-A, CMF-B, CMF-CD and CMF-EV.  Together  with  the  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi volumes, these 4 platforms will be able to produce more than 6 million vehicles per year within the Alliance. These are unprecedented strategic choices made possible by a robust  product  strategy  developed  in  'family'  mode  (a 'parent'  vehicle  and  multi-brand  variants)  based  on modular platforms covering all energies and all vehicle segments.\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\n## The Alliance's 4 common platforms\n\nCMF-A is  the  multi-energy  platform  for  small  urban  cars (excluding  the  specific  'kei  cars'  market  in  Japan).  Its architecture  is  compatible  with  thermal  and  electric motors. For example, it accommodates the Dacia Spring and Renault Kiger models.\n\nCMF-B is  the multi-energy modular platform of reference. In addition to thermal engines, this platform is compatible with  LPG  and  enables  the  electrification  of  vehicles: hybrids and plug-in hybrids. It is designed to accommodate advanced driving aids leading to the first levels of driving autonomy. Its modular architecture allows it  to  offer  models  ranging  from  B-segment  sedans  to  Csegment SUVs adapted in terms of performance and cost to  suit  the  markets.  For  example,  it  accommodates  the Renault  Clio,  Captur,  Arkana,  Dacia  Sandero,  Logan  and Jogger models.\n\nIn  2021,  the  CMF-B  platform  is  undergoing  development  to accommodate 4x2 and 4x4 SUVs. Its modularity is preserved with  several  wheelbases  or  overhangs.  Its  main  technical evolutions  will  incorporate  modifications  to  better  meet  the proportions of the C-segment, the extension of weight limits, the  upgrade  of  its  electrical  and  electronic  equipment packaging system, the 4x4 transmission and the extension of its hybridization offer. It will eventually house the future Duster/ Bigster family.\n\nAlso,  as  announced  at  the  end  of  June  2021  during  the E-Ways  event,  Renault  Group  has  chosen  to  electrify  its CMF-B platform. This strategy will reduce the development cost of  future  vehicles  by  33%  compared with the current generation of ZOE. A result achieved with the interchangeability  of  the  battery  module,  a  right-sized powertrain  of  100  kW  at  lower  cost,  and  all  non-EV components from the CMF-B platform. The electric version of CMF-B will offer outstanding performance: a range of up to  400  km  in  WLTP  with  no  compromise  on  design, acoustics  and  driving  behavior.  It  will  also  feature  the group's Plug & Charge innovation based on the NF -C 15118 regulation. It will eventually house the New Renault 5.\n\nCMF-CD is the platform dedicated to vehicles in the C and D segments. In 2021, the platform is being upgraded to be compatible with internal combustion and hybrid engines. It will carry the next generation of Renault Group's C-SUV family  with  a  complete  technological  renewal:  driving aids,  connected  services  with  remote  system  updates (FOTA: Firmware Over The Air), rear multi-link steering and predictive  damping  control.  It  will  be  home  to  Austral  in 2022, the first model in the Renault C-SUV family.\n\nCMF-EV is  the  platform  dedicated  to  C  and  D  segment electric  vehicles.  This  100%  electric  platform  frees  itself from the constraints generated by thermal architectures and offers greater freedom of design (reduced overhang, large  wheels),  a  passenger  compartment  in  the  upper segment  in  relation  to  its  exterior  dimensions  and  an unprecedented  level  of  performance:  energy  efficiency for autonomy, acoustic insulation and first-class dynamic behavior. It accommodates Megane E-TECH.\n\nI\n\n01",

It covers  software  and  electrical/electronic  equipment architecture, connected services, multimedia and driving aids in vehicles across the board. It provides the physical platforms and vehicles with a large part of the on-board intelligence of Renault products and, more widely, of the Alliance.  This  logic  helps  reduce  costs  and  the  price  of engineering and helps increase carry-over while remaining focused on the expectations of our customers.\n\nRenault  continues  to  roll  out  the  SWEET  100  generation, which is fitted to all new vehicles from the new Clio onwards.\n\nThe  new  generation,  SWEET  200,  comes  with  the  new CMF-EV  platform  and,  in  particular,  the  100%  electric Megane  E-TECH.  This  new  generation  introduces  26 driving  aids  on  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric divided into three categories: driving, parking and safety.\n\n## Here are some examples of the driving aids made possible by the new SWEET electronic platform:\n\n- \u25cf Active  Driver  Assist combines  contextual  adaptive cruise control with 'Stop & Go' and Lane Keeping Assist. While adaptive cruise control remains much the same, by default it is set to Auto mode, to automatically adapt to  the  speed  detected  by  the  camera  and  navigation system. Active Driver Assist also uses geolocation data and specific maps that include commonly encountered features  on  interurban  roads  such  as  roundabouts, speed limit changes and sharp turns.\n- \u25cf Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), which is even more advanced than  ever  with  its  latest  iteration:  Emergency  Lane Keeping  Assist  (ELKA).  It  combines  data  from  the  front camera  and  side  radar  to  automatically  recenter  the vehicle in the lane when about to cross a line, it detects a possible  collision  from  the  front,  the  side,  or  when  the vehicle  is  about  to  drive  off  the  road.  The  Emergency Lane  Keeping  Assist  operates  between  65  km/h  and 160 km/h (maximum possible speed of the vehicle) when crossing  a  line  and  there  is  a  risk  of  a  side  collision  or when about to drive off the road, and between 65 km/h and 110 km/h when there is a risk of a front-on collision.\n- \u25cf Rear  Automatic  Emergency  Braking (Rear  AEB):  this  is the part of automatic emergency braking that activates when the driver is reversing. If the rear ultrasonic sensors detect a potential obstacle (pedestrian, cyclist, pole), the system  gives  the  driver  a  visual  and  audible  initial warning.  If  the  driver  does  not  react,  the  system automatically applies the brakes for two seconds in an emergency  to  avoid  the  collision.  The  system  is  active when reversing between 3 km/h and 10 km/h.\n- \u25cf Occupant  Safe  Exit (OSE):  as  an  occupant  opens  the car door, it warns of an oncoming vehicle, motorcycle or cyclist in order to avoid hitting or being hit. A visual and  audible  warning  system  that  also  helps  avoid dooring accidents that often affect cyclists in the city.\n- \u25cf Around View Monitor 3D (360\u00b0 3D vision camera): this system uses four cameras to display a 3D model of the vehicle  and  view  its  surroundings  close  to  360\u00b0. The driver can then view the exterior by turning around the vehicle via the touch screen with a panoramic view of the front and rear of the vehicle in order to help him to confidently park the car.\n- \u25cf The Full  Auto  Park feature  is  an  improvement  on  the Easy Park Assist semi-automatic parking system. This time, the system is nearly entirely autonomous as the driver  is  no  longer  required  to  even  change  gears between drive and reverse, or to use the accelerator or the  brakes  during  an  assisted  maneuver.  The  driver role  is  limited  to  monitoring  the  environment  and  to press  down  on  the  accelerator  to  indicate  to  the system to either continue or stop the maneuver.\n- \u25cf Smart Rear View Mirror :  this system runs on a camera located at the top of the rear window. It provides a realtime  view  of  the  road  behind  on  the  vehicle's  interior rear-view mirror, giving an entirely unobstructed view, in addition to that seen in the door mirrors.\n\nIn terms of multimedia and connectivity: with SWEET 200 comes the new generation of the platform of connected services and OpenR Link services:\n\n- \u25cf It combines,  in  an  inverted  L-shape,  the  digital instrument  panel  and  central  console  multimedia screen.  This  is  the  first  time  such  technology  will  be standard  issue  for  such  cars  and  has  been  made possible  thanks  to  many  long  years  of  work  from  the Renault Design, Product and Engineering teams. It also houses the central air vents, in keeping with the flush finish of the car's interior.\n- \u25cf It  is  made  using  reinforced  glass  for  a  more  robust finish  that  is  pleasing  to  touch  and  to  look  at.  Screen brightness  and  light  reflectiveness  have  both  been optimized to ensure good visibility even in full sunlight, enhanced  by  the  anti-reflection  coat.  The  traditional dashboard sun guard has therefore been removed as no  longer  necessary,  saving  space  and  making  the final look more streamline and modern.\n- \u25cf It  has  a  display  area  like  no  other:  321  cm\u00b2  for  the 12.3-inch dashboard screen (1,920 x 720 pixels, landscape)  and  453  cm\u00b2  for  the  12-inch  multimedia screen (1,250 x 1,562 pixels, portrait). The on-board digital interfacing  therefore  measures  a  total  of  774  cm\u00b2, unlike  any  other  vehicle  in  the  category,  more  in  line with  the  much  larger  top-end  sedans.  The  entry-level model features a 9-inch multimedia screen (1,250 x 834 pixels, landscape).\n- \u25cf It incorporates state-of-the-art technology for a smooth and  immersive  experience.  This  includes  the  thirdgeneration  Snapdragon  Automotive  Cockpit  Platform by Qualcomm  with multiple display capabilities, advanced  connectivity  with  USB-C  ports  and  all essential  technology  for  on-board  safety  and  drive assistance.\n- \u25cf As for on-board software, the new OpenR Link system with  Google  built-in  for  an  intuitive  and  optimized connected experience.",

An  E-TECH  Plug-in Hybrid model can be driven up to 65 km/h in 100% electric mode  and  with  the  pleasure  of  the  electric  motor  up  to 135 km/h.\n\nThe  powertrain  common  to  Renault  Group's  hybrid powertrains is available in two varieties: E-TECH Hybrid for  'full  hybrid'  (HEV  or  'hybrid')  and  E-TECH  Plug-in Hybrid for 'plug-in hybrid' (PHEV or 'plug-in hybrid'). It can  be  easily  integrated  into  these  models  thanks  to their  modular  CMF-B  and  CMF-C/D  platforms,  which were designed from the outset to enable electrification. In  addition,  the  unprecedented  compactness  of  the E-TECH hybrid technology allows it to fit into the engine compartment of a versatile city car such as Clio.\n\nRenault's  engineers  have  developed  a  revolutionary solution  to  offer  a  relevant,  original,  exclusive  hybrid vehicle,  which  has  been  patented  more  than  150  times. It  is  based  on  a  'series-parallel'  hybrid  architecture  to offer  the  maximum  number  of  operating  combinations between  the  various  engines  and  maximize  the  CO2 savings in use.\n\nThis hybrid technology also benefits from the expertise provided by the Alpine F1 Team. This allows the sharing of  technologies  developed  for  F1,  adapted  to  standard hybrid  vehicles.  This  technology  has  been  recognized with prestigious awards such as the Argus 'Special Jury Prize' and Technobest.\n\n## Innovation services\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  Renault  Group  is  preparing  for  the launch of the new electric Megane E-TECH (early 2022) with  the  interior  adorned  by  its  crowning  jewel,  the innovative OpenR screen,  which  brings  together  data from the instrument panel and the multimedia interface all within the same unit.\n\n## A unique connected experience\n\nIn  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH Electric,  the  new  OpenR Link  multimedia  system  with  Google  built  in  provides helpful  and  familiar  apps  and  services  as  well  as  a system that is always up to date. It makes for a unique connected experience similar to the one of a smartphone  or  a  tablet  and  is  always  up  to  date.  This goes with smarter driving aids and a brand-new sound experience thanks to a new partnership with specialist Harman Kardon.\n\n## OpenR Link: The multimedia system that makes your car as intuitive as a smartphone\n\nInside  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric,  the  OpenR screen  stands  as  the  interior  design's  crowning  jewel. It features  the  brand's  new  OpenR  Link  multimedia system,  which  integrates  with  the  best  of  Google  for  a helpful, personalized and seamless experience.\n\nOffering maximum intuitiveness, the OpenR Link system is powered by Android Automotive OS, which is based on Android  OS,  the  same  operating  system  used  to  run more  than  75%  of  smartphones  around  the  world*. Developed  by  Google,  the  software  is  open  source, scalable, and always up to date.\n\nIn  addition  to  Google  Assistant  and  Google  Maps, OpenR  Link  supports  many  applications  developed  by third-party  developers  on  Google  Play.  On  the  12-inch version,  in  addition  to  the  main  display  (with  Google Maps navigation), the interface has been customized to accommodate  two  widgets  among  those  made available: charging, energy flow, air quality, tire pressure, music, etc. The interface on the 9-inch version features a screen split between four widgets.\n\nSimple and intuitive, OpenR Link integrates all the functions that  can  be  found  in  a  smartphone  or  tablet,  making  the All-new Megane E-TECH Electric an intuitive experience, as it is fully integrated into the digital ecosystem of its user. It can  also  be  used  as  a  tablet,  with  either  a  single  finger (short  press,  long  press,  scroll),  multiple  fingers  (pinch, zoom,  etc.),  or  by  using  the  voice  recognition  software.  It receives and displays notifications and allows you to easily navigate between its different spaces (Home/Navigation, Music, Phone, Applications, Vehicle) all thanks to the menu bar at the top of the screen.\n\nThe  OpenR  Link  system  can  also  be  customized  like  a smartphone, in particular through user accounts. These allow you  to define exhaustive  personal  profiles including the vehicle settings, Google Account preferences,  My  Renault  account  settings,  automatic smartphone  mirroring,  etc.  OpenR  Link  is,  of  course, compatible with Android Auto (for Android smartphones)  and  Apple  CarPlay  (for  iPhones)  and operates by cable link-up or as a wireless system. In this case, however, some of the most important services or functions of the OpenR Link system, such as the Electric Route Planner, are no longer available.\n\nFinally,  just  like  when  using  a  smartphone  or  tablet, OpenR Link updates automatically, via FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air)  technology.  No  need  to  schedule  an update with a dealership (even though you still can if you wish),  you  just  have  to  approve  the  warning  message that pops up on the screen to tap into a state-of-the-art system and applications, to make quality improvements and, as the life of the vehicle continues on, to get access to  new  features  for  the  multimedia  system  and  the vehicle itself.",

        "page_content": "The OpenR Link system integrates the best of Google apps and services built-in in order to build an overall experience residing on three main pillars:\n\n- \u25cf Google  Maps for navigation,  with  real-time  traffic information,  POI,  favorite  restaurants,  voice  activation, always up-to-date directions, and more.\n- \u25cf Google Assistant for hands-free help in the car (weather, help,  miscellaneous  requests)  and  voice  control  of multimedia system  functions and certain vehicle functions  such  as  climate  control  and  MULTI-SENSE settings.  There  are  a  few  ways  to  interact  with  Google Assistant:  saying  'Hey  Google',  pressing  the  voice control  button  on  the  steering  wheel,  or  tapping  the Google  Assistant  icon  on  the  infotainment  system through  the  system  menus.  Google  Assistant  can  also act  proactively,  for  example  to  suggest  a  destination based on daily habits or to suggest music to play.\n- \u25cf Google Play for  a  catalogue  of  more  than  40  apps that are  designed  to  be  used  with  a  car:  music,  media, podcasts and more.\n\nGoogle  Maps  also  includes  features  to  assist  electric vehicle  drivers.  The  New  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  route planner  programs  and  optimizes  the  route  of  long journeys  by  natively  integrating  the  recharging  stations. If an  entered  destination  has  an  insufficient  battery charging  level,  it  will  automatically  propose  a  choice  of available  compatible  charging  stations  along  the  route and the best combination to reach the destination as soon as  possible.  During  the  journey,  it  updates  automatically according to  the  vehicle's  data  (e.g.,  energy  use,  battery information). It also warns the driver if the planned route needs to be changed, should a charging station be out of order,  for  example.  As  with  a  smartphone,  a  4G  bundle with data is necessary to benefit from all these functions. An initial subscription will be included with the purchase of the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric,  and  it  can  be renewed via another package or replaced by connecting to the customer's smartphone.\n\n## Megane E-TECH Electric\n\nWith  the  all-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric,  Renault  offers the first model of its 'generation 2.0' electric vehicles.\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\n## Record-breaking powerful proportions\n\nWith  the  extended  wheelbase  (2.70  m  for  a  total  length  of 4.21  m)  and  reduced  overhang  offered  by  the  new  CMF-EV modular  platform,  the  all-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric displays unprecedented  proportions  that  have  given designers the opportunity to design a powerful sedan with a mastered  footprint.  The  battery  is  thinner  than  ever  (only 110  mm),  meaning  that  designers  could  refine  the  external proportions while also boosting the car's interior roominess to  footprint  ratio  and  lowering  the  center  of  gravity  for  a more fun and exciting driving experience.\n\nLastly,  the  all-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  combines  a compact design with a contained height (1.50 m), and yet the  considerable  space  inside  is  still  clearly  felt  from outside the vehicle.\n\n## Aerodynamics and efficiency\n\nFeatures  directly  inspired  from  the  world  of  crossovers give a sense  of  robustness:  large  20-inch  wheels, protective strips on the lower side and wheel arches, high belt  line.  The  dropping  line  of  the  roof,  wide  tracks,  and flush  door  handles  (as  standard)  feel  more  like  a  coup\u00e9. The contained height, spaciousness and boot volume are reminiscent of traditional of C-segment sedan models.\n\nImproving  the  aerodynamic  performance  thanks  to  an efficient  styling  was  a  main  aspect  of  the  design  process behind the all-new Megane E-TECH Electric. The contained height,  the  narrow-rimmed tires, sculpted bumper with air vents  at  the  front  and  character  lines  being  part  of  the bumper sides, all give a streamlined feel to the vehicle, but also help improve its overall fuel efficiency.\n\nEquipped  with  high-tech  lights  and  new  light  signature, the all-new Megane E-TECH Electric is a 'LIVING native': it comes to  life  when  you  approach  it,  displaying  a  unique welcome sequence that  is  enhanced  by  a  string  of  light and sound effects.\n\n## Automatic door handles\n\nEach  version  of  the  all-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric incorporates flush door handles. When the driver or front passenger approaches to open a door, or when the vehicle is unlocked,  the  handles  hidden  in  the  body  are automatically  and  electronically  pushed  out.  They  pop back into place after two minutes of remaining stationary, when the car begins to move forward, or when the doors are locked.\n\nI\n\n01",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## Renault Group\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n## OpenR, the largest screen around\n\nThis includes the third-generation Snapdragon Automotive  Cockpit  Platform  by  Qualcomm  with multiple  display  capabilities,  advanced  connectivity with  USB-C  ports  and  all  essential  technology  for  onboard safety and drive assistance (for example, Around View  Monitor  3D).  As  for  on-board  software,  the  new OpenR Link  system  with  Google  built-in  for  an  intuitive and  optimized  connected  experience.  The  'instrument panel' section of the OpenR screen accommodates four different  displays  according  to  the  driver's  priorities: Driving design (meters) - Navigation design (mapping) Zen design (minimalist) - Battery design (charge status).\n\n## Optimized steering and agility\n\nIn  designing  the  CMF-EV  platform,  particular  attention was  paid  to  ensuring  that  vehicles  built  around  the platform could combine the pull of an electric motor and a  lively  chassis  without  any  impact  on  comfort.  Brandnew  power  steering  has  been  added  so  the  steering ratio is now only 12 (lowest market value), for more agile, more  direct  feedback.  The  combined  effect  of  these features is that the all-new Megane E-TECH Electric has a clean and fast response to movements applied to the steering column, making maneuvering a breeze.\n\nIn addition to these features, there is also the Parallel Link multi-arm coupling on the rear axle. Together with the new steering column, it ensures solid traction for a safer drive, while still guaranteeing the best in precision steering.\n\n## Patented sound cocoon\n\nThe  innovative  'Cocoon  Effect  Technology',  developed and patented by Renault engineers, brings a level of audio comfort  while  driving  that  is  unparalleled,  even  for  a 'naturally' silent electric car. A layer of sound-absorbing foam  has  been  pressed  in  between  the  car's  floor  and across  the  whole  battery.  Improvements  are  best  felt above 30 km/h as it creates a sort of sound cocoon most often found on upper segment models so passengers can better  enjoy  the  silence,  their  music  or  conversational moments  with  other  passengers  even  on  motorways. Moreover,  the  'Cocoon  Effect  Technology'  is  very lightweight;  it  weighs  3  kilos  less  than  regular  sound proofing. It is enhanced by additional door lining, the sort of 'privilege' reserved for more premium models.\n\n## Ultra-thin battery\n\nMuch like its new power train, the All-new Megane E-TECH Electric also has a brand-new 395 kg battery designed to fit perfectly on the CMF-EV platform. At 110 mm (for 1,960 mm length  and  1,450  mm  width)  -  40%  smaller  than  the  ZOE battery - it is  the  thinnest  on  the  market.  It  contributes  to\n\nlowering the total height of the vehicle at 1.50 m for better aerodynamism  and  efficiency.  In  order  to  attain  such  a compact  size,  engineers  had  to  turn  to  a  new  chemical make-up for its batteries with the lithium-ion NMC (Nickel, Manganese,  Cobalt)  batteries  by  LG,  which  have  more nickel and less cobalt for greater energy density. Reaching 600  Wh/L,  it  is  20%  more  than  the  ZOE.  They  also  benefit from a new liquid coolant system located in the battery's lower housing unit - a Renault first - that makes the battery more  compact  and  efficient  thanks  to  the  extruded aluminum  tubes.  Measuring  only  18  mm  high,  it  makes fitting  the  battery  pack  on  the  platform  much  easier, leaving more room for overall design and space.\n\nBalanced  performance:  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH Electric comes with a choice of two battery capacities:\n\n- \u25cf 40 kWh for a range of 300 km (WLTP cycle);\n- \u25cf 60 kWh for a range up to 470 km (WLTP cycle, depending on each version).\n\nThe  40  kWh  battery  is  made  of  8  modules  of  24  cells each, distributed over a single layer. The 60 kWh battery consists of 12 modules of 24 cells each, spread over two layers.  In  both  cases,  the  battery's  dimensions  remain unchanged, including the record height of 110 mm. They come with an 8-year guarantee. In this interval, they will be  replaced  free  of  charge  if  they  deteriorate  to  less than 70% of their nominal capacity.\n\n## High energy efficiency\n\nThe  range  of  the  All-new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric  in everyday  use  is  increased  in  all  conditions,  in  summer and winter. This is thanks to the vehicle's high efficiency. This  has  been  made  possible  thanks  to  the  many affordable  charging  possibilities  (see  below),  but  also thanks to optimized energy recovery management and heat  exchange that  harnesses  a  new,  patented,  threepart system:\n\n- \u25cf new generation heat pump that improves the battery's coefficient of performance by 30% (-10 \u00b0C) compared with  ZOE.  It  incorporates  a  completely  new  heating, ventilation  and  air  conditioning  (HVAC)  system  and now uses electronic valves;\n- \u25cf an intelligent system for managing energy lost by the batteries  and  powertrain,  which  reuses  it  to  heat  the cockpit. This has been made possible by the arrival of a liquid cooling system for the batteries and powertrain (water-cooled oil);\n- \u25cf predictive  charging  management  uses  the  route  on the  vehicle's  navigation  system  to  set  the  battery  at the  appropriate  temperature  as  the  car  nears  a planned charging station. It makes the best use of the specific charging point's capabilities for a faster and/ or fuller charge.",

Two  of  the  latest  innovations  are  as clever  as  they  are  practical,  making  loading,  unloading and accessing cargo easier than ever.\n\nOpen Sesame by Renault :  the  widest  side  access  around at 1,446 mm\n\nBy  removing  the  central  body  pillar,  the  All-New  Kangoo Van  offers  the  widest  right-hand  side  access  on  the market with an opening 1,446 mm wide, twice that of the previous model. Extra convenient on city roads, this latest innovation known as 'Open Sesame by Renault' makes it easier  to  load  and  unload  cargo  via  the  side  access, avoiding any limitations brought on by rear access in tight parking  spaces  (city  street  parking,  car  parks,  etc.).  The pros:\n\n- \u25cf the  front  passenger  door  extends  open  90\u00b0  for  even easier access;\n- \u25cf the entire loading area is easily accessible;\n- \u25cf the folding passenger seat and swivel partition allow for a flat loading bed up to 3.05 m long;\n- \u25cf the passenger door and sliding door can be opened and closed in any order.\n\nEasy  Inside  Rack :  an  exclusive  innovation  for  overhead storage\n\nThe All-New Kangoo Van brings innovation to the fore with a retractable and lockable interior rack located just above the  passenger.  Known  as  the  'Easy  Inside  Rack',  it  makes better  use  of  the  storage  area  by  adding  upper  storage space for long objects (2 m - 2.5 m in the long version).\n\nA  feature  that  serves  multiple  purposes  (ladders,  pipes, etc.) and is right where it is meant to be without getting in the way. It frees up precious floor space to transport cargo or  passengers  safely  and  comfortably.  The  rack  has  a bearing  capacity  of  up  to  30  kg  and  does  not  exceed height limits often encountered in parking lots or tunnels. The pros:\n\n- \u25cf the rack can be folded away when not in use;\n- \u25cf stored items are protected against theft and inclement weather;\n- \u25cf unlike roof racks, these do not cause aerodynamic noise or reduced fuel efficiency.\n\nThe passenger seat can remain upright and usable, which is not possible when long items are stowed directly on the floor (swivel partition and folding seat).\n\nTowards the end of 2021, the Renault Kangoo was named 'International Van of the Year' (IVOTY).\n\nI\n\n01",

The Group constantly ensures that it has appropriate tools to enable it to respond to these requirements.\n\nThe regulatory framework of the European Union, which is applicable  by  extension  to  around  40  countries geographically  in  or  close  to  Europe,  allows  approval granted in one European Union country on the basis of a common list of technical regulations to be recognized in  another  European  Union  country  and  registration  in all European Union countries without additional technical constraints.\n\nThe  European  framework  is  historically  the  pioneer  of many  national  technical  regulations  around  the  world. It  is  based in particular on Regulation (EU) No. 2018/858 on  the  approval  and  market  surveillance  of  motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles , amended by Regulation (EU) No. 2019/2144 of November  27,  2019,  type-approval  requirements  for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended for such  vehicles,  as  regards  their  general  safety  and  the protection  of  vehicle  occupants  and  vulnerable  road users , called  the  'General  Safety  Regulation'  (GSR), which  has  reinforced  approval  checks  and  production process  controls,  as  well  as  statistical  and  continuous oversight  of  vehicles  placed  on  the  market  and  many passive  and  active  safety  technical  requirements from 2022.\n\nCarmakers, and more generally the automotive sector, are involved in this continued strengthening of European technical  regulations,  within  the  framework  of  working groups  organized  by  the  European  Commission  and made up of the industries involved in the Member States. The  automotive  sector  is  also  involved  within  the broader framework of the UN working groups, made up of  around  60  countries  and  international  organizations (including  the  European  Union),  to  ensure  regulatory changes are made while taking into account technical and  industrial  challenges  and  opportunities,  as  well  as implementation deadlines.\n\nIt should be noted that the health situation experienced in 2020 and extended to 2021 resulted in some delays in the drafting of regulatory texts, but without delaying the adoption  dates.  Nor  has  it  had  any  influence  on  the determination  of  the  levels  of  regulatory  requirements whether in terms of active and passive safety or in terms of emissions and pollutants.\n\n## 1.4.1.2. Pollutant emissions and CO2\n\nIn  the  last  few  years  there  has  been  a  considerable change in regulatory requirements set out on pollutant emissions by Regulation (EC) No. 715/2007, amended by (EU)  No.  2018/858  on  type  approval  of  motor  vehicles with  respect  to  emissions  from  light  passenger  and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information , supplemented by Commission regulation (EU) No. 2017/ 1151 of June 1, 2017, amended by (EU) No. 2018/1832.\n\nSince  September  1,  2018,  the  pollutants  of  all  new passenger cars (PC) and light commercial vehicles (LCV) are measured using the Euro 6 and CO2 limits, during a new cycle that is more representative of use, called the WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light Duty Test Procedure). The WLTP was implemented one year later for new, heavier LCVs.\n\nIn  addition  to  WLTP,  which  measures  pollutants  in  the laboratory,  a  procedure  known  as  RDE  (Real  Driving Emissions) was introduced in two stages, after an initial monitoring phase. This procedure allows emissions to be checked  under  real  road  conditions  (driving,  road profiles, weather, etc.).\n\nThe  first  interim  stage,  called  Euro  6d  TEMP,  sets  controls for  NOx  (nitrogen  oxide)  emissions  using  a  compliance factor  of  2.1  and  particulates  by  number  (PN)  using  a compliance factor of 1.5, taking measurement uncertainties into  account. Euro 6d TEMP has been applicable to all new PCs and small LCVs since September 1, 2019, and to all heavy LCVs from September 1, 2020.\n\nA second step, known as Euro 6d, provides for reducing this compliance factor to 1.00 for NOx and PR and takes into  account  a  measurement  uncertainty  margin  of 0.43  for  NOx  and  0.5  for  PR,  it  being  specified  that  the latter  factor  will  be  revised  each  year  in  the  light  of progress  in the Portable Emissions  Measurement System  (PEMS)  procedure  and  equipment.  Euro  6d  has been  applicable  to  new  models  since  January  1,  2020, and will be applicable to all PCs and small LCVs, as well as new heavy LCVs from January 1, 2021, and lastly to all heavy PCs since September 1, 2020.",

This is one of the few industries that produce consumer goods for which vehicle inspection is required  at  between  six  months  and  five  years,  or 15,000 km and 100,000 km.\n\nA new intermediate stage called Euro 6e making corrections and amendments to the Euro 6d procedures (WLTP 3 rd Act / RDE package 5), without changing the limits, could appear in January 2023 according to our internal scenario, with a vote expected in 2022.\n\nThe next major regulatory milestone is Euro 7. The European Commission has commissioned a consortium of consultants to develop a substantiated proposal for the Euro 7 technical requirements.\n\nThe co-decision proposal to be submitted to the European Parliament  and  the  Council  is  expected  in  early  2022. The  Commission's  aim  is  for  Euro  7  to  be  the  last  step before zero emissions.\n\nThe health situation did not have a significant impact on regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  emissions,  either  on their content or their timing.\n\nIn addition, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 setting CO2 emission performance  standards is  applicable  to  new  passenger cars  and  light  commercial  vehicles.  It  represents  a  very important component of climate protection in Europe.\n\nThe regulation (EU) 333/2014 had stipulated a limit of 95 g of  CO2/km  applicable  to  95%  of the  passenger  car  fleet starting from 2020. Starting from 2021, the regulation (EU) No.  2019/631  defines  the  targets  to  be  reached  by  2030. It  stipulates  achievement  by  2025  of  a  reduction  of  15% compared  with  a  start  point  calculated  in  2021  and,  in 2030, a reduction of 37.5% compared with this same start point.  These  objectives  cannot  be  achieved  without  a significant  increase  in  the  share  of  hybrid  and  electric cars in the Renault range. In addition, regulation No. 2019/ 631 introduces an incentive to exceed a minimum level of zero- or low-emission vehicles (ZLEVs) as a percentage of the range in 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe  same  principles  apply  to  light  commercial  vehicles, with a target of 147 g of CO2/km in 2020 and ambitions for a reduction of 15% in 2025 and 31% in 2030, compared with a base defined in 2021.\n\nIn  2020, the European Union made a strong commitment to  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  As  a  result,  it  significantly increased  its  CO2  emissions  targets  (from  -37.5%  to  at least  -55%  for  passenger  cars  for  instance)  for  the transport segment. This stringent CO2 reduction trajectory means  an  ambition  of  -100%  reduction  starting  in  2035, which, as the proposal stands, would also prohibit the sale of PHEVs.  These  risks  are  closely  monitored,  and counterproposals  have  been  brought  to  the  attention  of the  European  Commission.  These  tightening  measures are already included in Renault's scenarios for 2030.\n\nThe regulation No. 2019/631 also stipulates a penalty of \u20ac95 per gram of CO2 and per vehicle sold in the event of failure to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. However, this regulation provides a certain amount of flexibility, such as the  possibility  of  forming  a  pool  between  manufacturers and benefiting from gains made through eco-innovations or vehicles with zero and very low consumption.\n\nThe  revision  clause  of  2023  introduced  into  regulation No.  2019/631  lays  down  the  principle  of  setting  new objectives for 2035 and 2040, in order to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050.\n\nThis  desire  to  combat  global  warming  is  found  in  other countries where Renault operates, such as China, Brazil and India.  In  addition,  China  in  particular  has  comprehensive regulations for electric vehicles (pure and hybrid electric).\n\n## 1.4.1.3. Passive safety and active safety\n\nThe  entry  into  force  of (EU)  regulation  No.  2019/2144  on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical  units  intended  for  such  vehicles , will  require manufacturers  to  incorporate  an  entire  series  of  safety systems  and  to  design  the  structure  of  new  vehicles taking into account new requirements aimed at minimizing the severity of accidents in head-on, side and rear impact collisions.\n\n## 1.4.1.3.1. Passive safety\n\nAll newly approved PCs and small LCVs from July 2022 will have to meet new requirements for head-on, side and rear impact  collisions.  The  requirements  will  be  applicable  to all  newly  registered  vehicles  in  the  European  Union  from July 2024.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  requirements  for  the safety of pedestrians will apply to the front end of these vehicles, in order to extend the protection zones up to the windscreen.\n\nI",

Active safety\n\nFrom July 2022, all newly approved PCs and small LCVs (classes M1 and N1) will be required to be equipped during manufacture with:\n\n- \u25cf an  AEB  (Advanced  Emergency  Braking)  system  to reduce the risk of collision with other vehicles, whether stationary or in motion;\n- \u25cf an  Emergency  Lane  Keeping  system  that  brings vehicles  back  into  their  lane  before  an  involuntary crossing (without indicator signals) of an unbroken line and  alerts  drivers  in  the  event  of  an  involuntary crossing of a broken line;\n- \u25cf an  Intelligent  Speed  Adaptation  system  capable  of alerting the driver when vehicle speed exceeds the limits;\n- \u25cf a  Driver  Drowsiness  &  Attention  Warning  system, which  should  be  based  on  analysis  of  activity  at  the steering wheel, pedals, etc.\n\nThese advanced driver aid systems (ADAS) will become obligatory  from  July  2024  for  all  newly  registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nTwo  years  after  these  dates,  new  ADAS  will  become mandatory in turn, such as the AEB system, which takes pedestrians and cyclists into account, and the Advanced Driver Distraction Warning system, which will require  technologies  that  use  cameras  and  image analysis algorithms.\n\nFrom July 2022, all newly approved PCs and commercial vehicles  (LCVs  and  public  transit)  must,  depending  on their PC, public transit, light LCV or heavy LCV category, be  equipped  with  pedestrian  and  cyclist  proximity detection  and/or  vision  systems  on  the  front,  side  and rear of the vehicle.\n\nThese systems will become obligatory from July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\n## 1.4.1.4. Cybersecurity\n\nRegulation 661/2009 also introduced vehicle cybersecurity requirements (all categories) through the adoption of the new Geneva regulation that codifies this area.  These  requirements  will  become  effective  in July 2022 for newly approved vehicles and in July 2024 for all newly registered vehicles in the European Union.\n\nThese  new  provisions  require  manufacturers  to  put  in place a very well structured Cyber Security Management System  to  ensure  traceability  and  transparency  for  all decisions  and  approvals  in  respect  of  the  inspection authorities and require incorporation in vehicles of state-\n\nof-the-art technical solutions to limit cyber risks as soon as these are designed.\n\nVarious  countries,  such  as  Japan,  South  Korea,  Turkey and Israel, will adopt similar requirements with the same timelines.\n\nAlongside  these  requirements  for  setting  up  a  system  of governance  of  the  cybersecurity  of  their  products, manufacturers will have to set up a system for managing software developments in order to ensure the traceability of update decisions and vehicle configurations.\n\n## 1.4.1.5. Autonomous and/or connected vehicles\n\nAlthough  not  a  compulsory  feature,  regulations  for vehicles with driverless operation services cover, in the initial  stages,  systems  that  help  drivers  to  stay  in  lane and  to  drive  in  congested  traffic  and  on  highways (Advanced Lane Keeping Systems).\n\nExtensions to more ambitious use cases should become reality by 2025.\n\n'Driverless'  vehicles  are  a  special  case  that  will undoubtedly be handled through testing carried out at the national level, and authorizations issued locally, for public transport and other uses.\n\nIn parallel, the rules of the road are gradually beginning to  be  changed  in  order  to  authorize  the  use  of  these autonomous  driving  systems.  The  amendment  to  the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which was adopted in  2020  and  formalized  in  2021,  thus  paves  the  way  for developments in this direction in Germany, France and the UK.\n\nConnectivity is also a special case, insofar as it calls on a number of players outside the automotive sector.\n\n## 1.4.1.6. Prohibited substances and materials and recycling\n\nThe substances regulation governs the registration of all substances and materials present in  vehicles  and  sets out prohibitions and limitations of these substances and materials,  with  monitoring  of  each  vehicle  to  avoid distribution  on  the  market  of  harmful  or  prohibited products and facilitate recycling of end-of-life vehicles and their batteries.\n\nGlobal guidelines on regulatory substances and recycling of vehicles and batteries are mainly set by the European Union.",

This  accelerated process  applied  for  the  first  time  to  this  PFAS  family  is expected  to  be  extended  rapidly  to  phthalates  and  all substances  and  their  families  since  they  are  endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and to any substance that has a negative effect on the reproduction of living  organisms  (CMR  substances),  bioaccumulative  and toxic  substances,  substances  that  develop  respiratory  or skin allergies, or immunotoxic or neurotoxic substances.\n\nThe European Commission is expected call for any ban on the European Union to be extended worldwide as soon as an  international  convention  of  the  UN  environmental program allows it. This is the case for persistent organic pollutants (POP).\n\n- \u25cf For  batteries , transformation  of  the  current  regulation limited  to  recovery  criteria into  a  regulation  covering their entire life cycle from the supply of raw materials to the treatment of batteries as end-of-life waste. This new regulation would introduce:\n- \u25cf technical  requirements  for  performance,  durability, carbon  footprint,  recyclability  and  introduction  of recycled materials for construction with new batteries; and\n- \u25cf industrial  organization  requirements  imposing  on  us the  implementation  of  ethical  rules  throughout  the supply chain (due diligence) to be periodically audited by the authorities.\n- \u25cf For vehicles, transforming, like for batteries ,  the current regulations  limited  to  recovery  and  recycling  into regulations covering their entire life cycle with requirements  on  the  content  of  recycled  plastic products and ethical requirements on our supply chain. This  new  regulatory  content  should  be  extended  to  all vehicles including large commercial vehicles.\n\nOther countries such as China, Korea, Japan and India could also  adopt  specific  requirements  for  the  recycling  of batteries and vehicles and/or emissions of materials present in vehicles to guarantee passenger cabin air quality.\n\n## 1.4.1.7. Stronger oversight\n\nThe  unique  legal  environment  in  European  Union  Member States  shows  a  general  trend  towards  more  stringent requirements and oversight of them by regulatory authorities, whether through stricter monitoring of approval tests,  maintaining  the  performance  of  vehicles  throughout their life via engine compliance inspections, maintaining the general  condition  of  the  rolling  vehicle  population  via reinforced  technical  controls,  enhanced  verification  of  the compliance  of  production  (COP)  and  monitoring  the compliance of new vehicles put on the market.\n\nFor example, through the new EU Regulation 2018/858, the European  Union  has  decided  to  implement  market oversight from September 2020 that consists of requiring each  Member  State  of  the  European  Union  to  conduct vehicle compliance inspections that include performance of  approval tests on a sample of vehicles representative of  their  national  market.  Another  purpose  of  market oversight is the monitoring of the functioning of technical services and approval authorities in each European Union Member State to detect and correct malfunctions in the European approval system.\n\nI\n\n01",

Industrial emissions management\n\nDirective  No.  2010/75  of  November  24,  2010,  known  as the  Industrial  Emissions  Directive  (IED) , replaced  the Integrated  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control  (IPPC) Directive  and  six  sector  directives,  including  the  large combustion plants directive (2001/80/EC).\n\nThe  IED  strengthens  a  number  of  requirements  for  the prevention  and  reduction  of  pollution  emitted  by industrial installations into the air, water and soil. It also establishes thresholds that are not to be exceeded.\n\nIt states that certain industrial facilities must first obtain administrative authorization. This authorization cannot be  issued  by  the  competent  administrative  authority unless certain environmental conditions are met (adequate preventive measures against pollution being undertaken  by  the  operator  and  ensuring  that  the facilities are not a significant source of pollution).\n\nOne of the guiding principles of this directive is the use of best  available  techniques  (BAT)  to  prevent  pollution  of all kinds. Activities that require administrative authorization must meet the BAT standard established, reviewed  and  updated  by  the  European  Commission, which  publishes  the  conclusions  in  the  'BREF'  (best available techniques reference document).\n\nMost of the Group's industrial sites depend on the BREF STS  (surface  treatment  using  solvents)  for  automotive paint activities, which has been revised and whose new conclusions  were  published  on  December  9,  2020,  in EU  Decision  2020/2009.  After  submitting  the  review dossier,  the  sites  concerned  will  have  to  put  in  place BATs  by  December  2024  to  comply  with  the  new\n\nthresholds  established  in  this  document.  Moreover,  the revision  of  the  BREF  SF  concerning  foundries  also started in 2019. Following the same logic as the BREF STS, this revision will eventually set the future emission limits for this activity.\n\nMonitoring requirements for facilities that may contaminate the soil and groundwater are provided.\n\nThe  IED  also  provides  for  the  requirement  to  draw  up  a 'base  report'  on  the  condition  of  the  site  before  the installation  is  commissioned  or  before  the  first  update  of the  authorization  issued  and  for  a  redefinition  of  the requirement to restore the site upon cessation of activity.\n\n## 1.4.2.2. Air emissions management\n\n## European Directive (EU) 2015/2193 of November 25, 2015 ,\n\nregulates  emissions  from  medium-sized  combustion plants.  It  sets  emissions  thresholds  for  sulphur  dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust into the atmosphere  from  combustion  plants  with  a  nominal thermal  power  greater  than  or  equal  to  1  MW  and  less than 50 MW, regardless of the type of fuel that they use. It  also  establishes  rules  to  monitor  carbon  monoxide (CO) emissions.\n\nOperators  must  implement  emissions  monitoring  in accordance with the requirements set out in Annexe III to this directive and periodic measurements  in particular. CO  measurements  are  required  for  all facilities.\n\nEuropean  regulation  (EU)  517/2014  of  April  16,  2014, (F-Gas) , which  repealed  regulation  (EC)  842/2006  on January  1,  2015,  aims  to  contain,  prevent  and  reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThis regulation:\n\n- \u25cf discourages  the  use  of  fluorinated  gases  with  a  high impact on the climate and encourages energy efficient and safe substitutes;\n- \u25cf continues to improve the containment and end-of-life treatment  of  products  and  equipment  containing fluorinated gases;\n- \u25cf promotes  consensus  on  an  international  agreement under the Montreal Protocol to gradually reduce HFCs, which are the main group of fluorinated gases;\n- \u25cf ensures that the European Union takes into account the latest  scientific  results  obtained  at  the  international level, as recorded in the IPCC fourth Assessment Report, as  regards  in  particular  the  substances  covered  by  the regulation and their global warming potential (GWP).",

Its  application  for  the 4 th phase that has started (2021-2030) is mainly governed by Implementing  Regulation  (EU)  2018/2066  on  the  monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThis  system  requires  sites  subject  to  the  regulation  to report  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions  each  year  and return a number of 'allowances' equivalent to the metric tons  of  CO2  emitted.  A  certain  number  of  allowances  is allocated free of charge, and additional allowances may be purchased on the primary or secondary markets.\n\nFor  the  4 th phase,  the  allocation  of  free  allowances  is governed by strict rules, specified in Delegated Regulation (EU)  2019/331.  Annual  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are verified  by  an  independent  accredited  third  party  as described in Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067.\n\nChanges  to  this  regulation,  in  particular  the  loss  of  the 'carbon leakage' exposure status since the entry into the 4 th phase,  has  greatly  reduced  the  number  of  free allowances for sites subject to the regulation.\n\nIn Korea, an exchange system was put in place in 2015, by a 2012 law (Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emissions  Allowances)  and  an  associated  decree.  The Busan site (RSM) is subject to this law.\n\n## 1.4.2.3. Water management\n\nRenault Group is subject to applicable European regulations  on  the  use  and  protection  of  water  since  it abstracts, uses, and discharges water during its production processes.\n\nEuropean Directive No. 2000/60/EC of October 23, 2000, known  as  the  Water  Framework  Directive  (WFD) , establishes a framework for a community water policy.\n\nThe  WFD  defines  a  framework  for  the  management  and protection  of  waters  by  major  hydrographic  basin  at  the European level. It plays a strategic and founding role in water policy,  setting  ambitious  objectives  for  the  preservation  and restoration of the condition of surface water (freshwater and coastal water) and for groundwater.\n\nThe main objectives of the directive are:\n\n- \u25cf achieving,  starting  in  2015,  a  good  condition  for  all  of these  waters,  which  means  a  good  ecological  and chemical condition for surface water, as well as a good qualitative and quantitative condition for groundwater;\n- \u25cf adopting  a  combined  approach  of  environmental quality standards (Directive 2008/105/EC of December  16,  2008)  through  removal  of  hazardous substances and emission thresholds based on the best available techniques, using the approach leading to the most stringent standards;\n- \u25cf immediately  implementing  this  approach  for  priority hazardous substances for the Community, i.e., identifying  them  and  establishing  emission  thresholds and quality standards for them;\n- \u25cf establishing a management plan for each hydrographic basin;\n- \u25cf taking into account the principle of recovering the costs of  water-related  services,  integrating  the  polluter  pays principle established by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union;\n- \u25cf increasing public participation, through more and better information and involving the public in decision-making.\n\nPublic  authorities  are  also  imposing  strict  regulations  on industrial  wastewater  that  may  be  discharged  into collection systems and on treated wastewater and sludge from urban wastewater treatment plants.\n\nThe  WFD  set  targets  for  2015,  but  its  implementation timetable runs until 2027. Discussions are still underway on the  issue  of  water,  and  on  the  reuse  of  domestic wastewater  in  particular.  Better  treatment  of  this  water could  significantly  increase  the  use  of  wastewater, especially for agricultural irrigation.\n\nEuropean Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of December 16, 2020, on the quality of water intended for human consumption aims  to  ensure  high-quality  tap  water  throughout  the European  Union.  This  directive  is  in  response  to  the demands  of  over  1.8  million  Europeans  who  signed  the first-ever successful European Citizens' Initiative, 'Right2Water',  in  support  of  improving  access  to  safe drinking water for all Europeans.\n\nBy early 2022, the Commission will draw up and monitor a list  of  substances  or  compounds  of  public  or  scientific concern  to  health.  These  will  include  pharmaceuticals, endocrine-disrupting compounds, and microplastics. We are waiting for the transposition texts in each of the countries  where  Renault  is  located  to  meet  these  new requirements, which are incumbent, among others, on the owners of water distribution networks (companies) and, in particular,  the  new  drinking  water  quality  standards. The theoretical time frame for transposing this Directive into local law is two years.\n\nLastly, the scarcity of water resources is a major issue for the  coming  years.  India  has  already  put  in  place obligations in this regard. In that country, domestic water must be treated and reused in toilets.\n\nI\n\n01",

Waste management\n\nEuropean  Directive  2008/98/EC  of  November  19,  2008, known  as  the  Waste  Framework  Directive  (WFD) , defines  the  rules  applicable  to  the  treatment  of  waste within  the  European  Union.  It  applies  to  all  objects  or substances  that  the  holder  discards  or  that  he  or  she intends  or  is  required  to  discard.  The  WFD  reaffirms,  in the name of the polluter pays principle, the responsibility of a waste producer to manage its waste in a way that does not endanger  human  health  or  harm  the environment.\n\nThe  Directive  also  introduces  a  requirement  for  waste producers to limit their impact on the use of resources by preventing and reducing waste with a view to transitioning to a circular economy.\n\nIt  establishes  a  hierarchy  of  waste  treatment  methods, requiring  waste  producers  to  prioritize,  in  the  following order:\n\n- \u25cf waste prevention;\n- \u25cf preparation for its reuse;\n- \u25cf recycling;\n- \u25cf other forms of recovery, in particular energy recovery;\n- \u25cf disposal.\n\nIt also clarifies the concept of recovery, disposal, end of waste  status and by-products and requires the establishment of separate collections for paper, metal, plastic, and glass, as a minimum.\n\nThe Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements  of  waste  and  its  disposal , which  was adopted  on  March  22,  1989,  and  entered  into  force  on May  5, 1992, regulates and  limits transboundary shipments of waste.\n\nIt calls  on  the  187  Parties  to  observe  fundamental principles such as proximity to waste disposal, environmentally sound management, prioritize recovery, and prior informed consent to the importing of potentially hazardous substances.\n\nEuropean Regulation (EC) 1013/2006 of June 14, 2006 ,  on the shipment of waste transposes the principles of the Basel Convention into European law.\n\nIt  requires  the  limitation  of  cross-border  shipment  of waste through observance of the principles of proximity and prioritization of recovery. To determine if transfer of waste is possible, and the applicable procedure (communication or notification), the following need to be considered:\n\n- \u25cf the origin of the waste (country of production);\n- \u25cf the destination and route of the waste (transfer inside or outside the EU/EFTA/OECD);\n- \u25cf the  type  of  treatment  to  be  applied  to  the  waste (recovery or disposal);\n- \u25cf the type of waste transferred;\n- \u25cf non-hazardous  waste:  green  list  (Annex  III  of  the regulation);\n- \u25cf hazardous  waste:  orange  list  (Annex  IV  of  the regulation).\n\nUnder 'extended producer responsibility' (EPR) regimes , producers who place waste-generating products on the market must take responsibility for management of that waste financially and/or operationally. This responsibility can  be  implemented  through  individual,  shared,  or collective systems (eco-organizations).\n\nSeveral European directives have introduced this type of obligation  for  certain  types  of  waste  (sectors).  In  the course  of  its  activities,  Renault  Group  is  particularly concerned  by  regulations  relating  to  batteries  and accumulators (particularly for electric vehicle batteries) and end-of-life vehicles.\n\nDirective 2006/66/EC of September 6, 2006, on batteries and  accumulators  as  well  as  battery  and  accumulator waste prohibits  the  marketing  of  certain  batteries  and accumulators  with  a  mercury  or  cadmium  content above a determined threshold.\n\nIn  addition,  it  encourages a high level of collection and recycling for battery and accumulator waste as well as an  improvement  in  the  environmental  performance  of all actors in the life cycle of batteries and accumulators, including  during  the  recycling  and  disposal  of  battery and accumulator waste.\n\nThis Directive prohibits the landfilling or incineration of industrial  and  automotive  battery  and  accumulator waste.  Only  their  residues  from  both  treatment  and recycling may be landfilled or incinerated.\n\nThe  net  costs  of  collecting,  processing,  and  recycling industrial  and  automotive  batteries  and  accumulators must be paid by the producers.\n\nDirective 2000/53/EC of September 18, 2000, on end-oflife vehicles (ELVs) defines the measures to be taken to prevent  and  limit  waste  from  end-of-life  vehicles  and their  components,  and  to  ensure  that  they  are  reused, recycled or recovered.\n\nVehicle  and  equipment  manufacturers  must  take  into account the dismantling, reuse, and recovery of vehicles in the design and production of their products, limit the use of hazardous  substances,  and  integrate  an increasing share of recycled materials into vehicles.\n\nThe  reuse  and  recycling  rate  for  end-of-life  vehicles  must reach a minimum of 85% by weight per vehicle per year on average.  The  reuse  and  recovery  rate  must  reach  a minimum of 95% by weight per vehicle per year on average.\n\nProducers (manufacturers or importers) must set up ELV collection systems, and owners may drop off their ELVs at authorized treatment facilities only, at no cost to them (unless the vehicle is incomplete).",

Renault  Group  ensures  that  the  regulations applicable to it are identified as soon as possible and taken into account in its production system. The European Union's Green Deal is a new European roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The policy is aimed notably at the circular\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\neconomy and the preservation of resources and biodiversity, which  are  also  central  to  the  Group's  concerns.  Renault Group is therefore preparing to meet the new challenges by showing  vigilance  and  continuing  to  pursue  an  approach designed  to continuously reduce  its impact  on  the environment.\n\nEven though the European Union is still the leader in this area,  countries  like  Korea,  China,  and  India,  which  are strongly  impacted  by  the  scarcity  of  resources  (water  in particular)  and  increasing  pollution  (air  and  waste)  are beginning to introduce more stringent regulations.\n\n## 1.4.3 European regulations applicable to the distribution of new vehicles and spare parts\n\nRenault  Group  is  subject  to  European  competition  law. Among  other  things,  this  law  prohibits  agreements  that prevent, restrict or distort competition. By way of exception, agreements  limiting  competition  (in  particular  through selection  of  resellers  or  provision  for  exclusive  terms  for them)  are  authorized  when  they  may  contribute  to improving the production and distribution of products or to promote technical or economic progress.\n\nThe  purpose  of the European  Commission's  block exemption regulations No. 330/2010 of April 20, 2010, and No. 461/2010 of May 27, 2010 ,  which are applicable to the distribution  of  new  vehicles  and  the  supply  of  spare automotive parts and to repair and maintenance services for  motor  vehicles  respectively,  is  to  exempt  from  the prohibition  of  cartels,  agreements  presumed  to  improve distribution without eliminating competition.\n\nThe  criteria  for  this  automatic  exemption  depend  on  the market  shares  of  the  parties  to  an  agreement  (maximum threshold  of  30%)  and  the  absence  of  any  marked restrictions  on  competition.  As  applied  to  the  automotive sector,  this  exemption  is  in  principle  applicable  to  the selection  by  manufacturers  of  their  network  of  authorized distributors and repairers.\n\nHowever,  the  presence  of  one  of  the  following  restrictions may prohibit the exemption from being applied:\n\n- \u25cf setting the price (fixed or minimum) at which distributors can  resell  vehicles  or  spare  parts  (prohibition  of  resale price maintenance);\n- \u25cf the  distribution  of  geographic  markets  or  customers between distributors (market distribution);\n- \u25cf the ban on sourcing by authorized distributors from other authorized distributors (restriction of cross-deliveries);\n- \u25cf the ban on the resale by authorized distributors of spare parts  to  independent  repairers  for  use  in  repair  or maintenance services; and\n- \u25cf the ban on the use by authorized repairers of spare parts of  a  quality  equivalent  to  original  parts  for  repair  or maintenance services.\n\nSimilarly,  under  regulation  No.  461/2010,  any  restriction concerning  access  by  independent  repairers  to  the technical  information  necessary  for  the  repair  and maintenance  of  vehicles  is  presumed  to  exclude  the benefit of exemption from the selection by Renault of its network of authorized repairers.\n\nRegulation No. 330/2010 expires on May 31, 2022. Following an evaluation  phase,  the  European  Commission  published,  on July 9,  2021,  the  draft  exemption regulation and guidelines on vertical  restraints,  preparing  the  revision  of  the  currently applicable  rules.  While  maintaining  the  overall  coherence  of the  existing  framework,  these  new  rules  are  intended  to provide updated guidance to take into account the growth of e-commerce and online platforms, to enhance the effectiveness of the fight against anti-competitive practices and to simplify their implementation.\n\nRegulation  No.  461/2010  expires  on  May  31,  2023.  Its effectiveness has been under evaluation by the European Commission, and it will decide no sooner than the second quarter  of  2021  whether  to  let  the  regulation  lapse  or  to extend or revise it.\n\nI\n\n01",

Some  countries,  such  as  the United  Kingdom,  Poland,  Spain,  and,  since  January  1, 2020,  Germany,  have  adopted  the  repair  clause  as national  law.  However,  other  countries  such  as  France, Slovakia  and  Croatia  refuse  this  deregulation  and therefore do not apply the repair clause principle.\n\nThe  repair  clause  could  become  applicable  to  all European  Union  countries.  In  late  2018,  the  European\n\nCommission  launched  a  public  consultation  on  the overall assessment of the design and model system with questions relating to the repair clause.\n\nThe extension of the repair clause to all European Union countries would have a significant economic impact on Renault Group's after-sales market share.\n\nFrance has just taken a first step towards this liberalization by passing a law that, starting on January 1, 2023:\n\n- \u25cf removes copyright protection for spare parts;\n- \u25cf reduces  the  duration  of  protection  of  spare  parts  by designs to 10 years (instead of 25 years);\n- \u25cf allows original equipment manufacturers to manufacture spare parts for replacement without the manufacturer's prior agreement.\n\n## 1.4.5 Banking regulations\n\nSeveral banking  sector  regulations applicable to Renault Group via its subsidiary RCI Bank and Services may significantly influence its activities.\n\nDirective  2013/36  of  June  26,  2013,  on  access  to  the activity of credit institutions and  the  prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment companies , known  as  the  'CRD  IV  Directive'  was transposed  in  France  by  Order  2014/158  and  by  the Decree of November 3, 2014. These texts have redefined the  rules  governing  the  approval  conditions  for  credit institutions, the governance  of  credit  institutions, internal  control  and  senior  executive  compensation, with the aim of harmonizing the regulations applicable to  credit  institutions  in  these  areas  at  European  level. They  are  therefore  an  essential  step  towards  the achievement  of  the  internal  market  in  the  banking sector. Directive 2019/878 amended Directive 2013/36 as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed  financial  holding  companies,  compensation, supervisory measures and powers, and capital conservation  measures.  This  directive  was  transposed into French law by Order No. 2020-1635 of December  21,  2020,  bringing  in  a  number  of  provisions adapting  the  legislation  to  European  Union  law  on financial matters.\n\nEuropean  Regulation  575/2013  of  June  26,  2013,  on prudential  requirements  for  credit  institutions  and investment companies , known as the 'CRD IV Directive',  introduced  new  requirements  for  capital, liquidity,  and  leverage  ratios.  This  regulation  aims  to strengthen the solidity of European banking institutions by improving the qualitative and quantitative aspects of capital.  This  text  was  amended  by  regulation  2019/630 as  regards  the  minimum  coverage  of  losses  on  nonperforming exposures. This new regulation also supplements  the  existing  prudential  rules  as  regards capital  with  provisions  for  a  deduction  from  capital  if non-performing  exposures  are  not  sufficiently  covered by provisions or other adjustments. The CRD IV Directive was  also  amended  by  Regulation  (EU)  2019/876  of May  20,  2019,  as  regards  the  leverage  ratio,  the  net stable  funding  ratio,  requirements  for  own  funds  and eligible  liabilities,  counterparty  credit  risk,  market  risk, exposures  to  central  counterparties,  exposures  to collective  investment  undertakings,  large  exposures, reporting  and  disclosure  requirements,  as  well  as Regulation  (EU)  2020/873  of  June  24,  2020,  as  regards certain  adjustments  in  response  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic.",

This  text  aims  to  ensure that  bankruptcies  of  European  banks  are  managed  in such a way as to preserve financial stability and minimize costs for taxpayers. It gives the competent authorities the means  to  intervene  before  difficulties  arise  and,  where necessary,  at  the  start  of  the  resolution  process.  The directive  entered  into  force  on  January  1,  2015.  These measures  were  supplemented  by  regulation  806/2014  of July 15, 2014, which  established  a  single  resolution mechanism  (SRM)  and  a  single  resolution  fund  (SRF). Finally,  this  directive  was  amended  by  Directive  2019/879 of May 20, 2019, as regards the capacity to absorb losses and recapitalize credit institutions. This directive clarifies the  fixing  of  the  MREL  (Minimum  Requirement  for  own funds and Eligible Liabilities specific to each establishment)  and  was  transposed  into  French  law  via Order  No.  2020-1636  of  December  21,  2020,  on  the resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nDirective 2008/48 of April 23, 2008, on credit agreements for consumers was transposed in France by Law 2010-737 of July 1, 2010, on consumer credit reform. The purpose of these texts is to provide better consumer protection and to harmonize national credit distribution rules. These texts require credit institutions to strengthen consumer information  by  providing  them  with  a  standardized European pre-contractual information sheet.\n\nDirective 2018/843 of May 30, 2018, amended Directive 2015/ 849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing .  This text was  transposed  in  France  by  Government  Order  2020-115  of February 12, 2021. This system:\n\n- \u25cf strengthens the transparency of complex legal entities and legal  structures  by  broadening  access  to  registers of beneficial owners;\n- \u25cf sets  out  the  enhanced  due  diligence  measures  to  be implemented  with  respect  to  business  relationships  or transactions involving high-risk third countries;\n- \u25cf sets  out  the  guarantees  to  be  put  in  place  to  mitigate high  money  laundering  risks  associated  with  entering into a remote business relationship; and\n- \u25cf establishes  the  principle  of  consolidated  supervision  of AML-CFT procedures by banking and insurance groups.\n\n| General presentation   | Sustainable   | Corporate   | Risk and   | Financial   | Annual general   | Additional   |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|\n| of Renault Group       | development   | governance  | control    | statements  | meeting          | information  |\n\nGeneral presentation of Renault Group\n\nDirective  2016/97  of  January  20,  2016,  on  insurance distribution , transposed  in  France  by  Decree  2018-361  of May  16,  2018,  aims  to  ensure  better  consumer  protection and  harmonize  national  rules  for  the  distribution  of insurance products. This text requires the establishment of governance procedures for the design and distribution of insurance products and the delivery of a new standardized information document (IPID) to customers.\n\nOn  February  25,  2019,  the  European  Banking  Authority published Outsourcing Guidelines (EBA/GL/2019/02). These guidelines set forth a governance  framework  for outsourcing  operations.  Accordingly,  they  require  an evaluation  of  each  subcontractor,  the  keeping  of  a register  of  services  outsourced,  and  the  inclusion  in contracts  with  subcontractors  of  a  certain  number  of clauses to ensure good control of the risks associated with the outsourcing.\n\nOn  January  18,  2017,  the  European  Banking  Authority published guidelines on the application of the definition of default (EBA/GL/2016/07).  The  purpose  of  this  text  is  to harmonize the definition of default by providing a detailed clarification  of  the  various  reasons  for  default  (including the counting of days in arrears), the conditions for a return to non-default and the associated processes. The text will be applicable starting January 1, 2021.\n\nIn addition, on September 28, 2016, the European Banking Authority  published  a  text  entitled  'Final  report  on materiality  threshold  of  credit  obligation  past  due' (RTS/2016/06).  This  text  introduces  a  single  methodology for the counting of days in arrears (Day past due counting) based  on  the  application  of  absolute  and  relative materiality thresholds.\n\nIn  its  Regulation  2018/1845  of  November  21,  2018,  the  ECB set the absolute threshold at 100 euros for retail exposures and  500  euros  for  other  exposures.  These  rules  must  be obeyed starting December 31, 2020.\n\nFinally,  the  European  Banking  Authority  also  published guidelines  for  estimates  of  probability  of  default  and estimates of loss given default (EBA-GL-2017-16).\n\nThese  guidelines  are  part  of  the  wider  work  of  the European Banking Authority to reduce unjustified variability in the results of internal models  while preserving the risk sensitivity of capital requirements.\n\nI\n\n01",

It  marks  a  major  shift  for  the  company:  from  a volume approach to a value approach. The new sustainable development strategy, announced at the General Meeting in  April  2021,  is  part  of  this  dynamic  approach:  doing  more with less and, above all, doing better.\n\nThe  Group's  sustainable  development  action  is  now based  on  three  pillars.  These  three  pillars  support Renaulution's transformation into a greener, more techintensive company driven by data, energy and services.\n\nThe  first  pillar  is  reduction  of  the  carbon  footprint  and optimized use of resources through the development of our circular economy activities.\n\nThe  second  pillar  is  leveraging  the  technology  in  our vehicles  to  improve  the  safety  of  users  of  our  vehicles and  services  on  the  roads.  This  pillar  also  covers  the safety of employees in the workplace.\n\nLastly, inclusion: the shift toward the new businesses of electrification,  data  and  the  circular  economy  will  be achieved by supporting the transformation of skills and promoting diversity within the group.\n\n'Carmaker and caremakers': we build cars while taking care of those who design and manufacture them, those who  use  them,  and  the  planet  on  which  they  are produced and driven.\n\nThis announcement marked the end of a review begun in 2019  and  a  major  collaborative  and  unifying  process involving  the  Company's  management  bodies,  the Group Works Council and all employees worldwide (via an  open  global  survey)  as  well  as  external  stakeholder panels.  A  study  on  the  company's  culture  was  also carried out at this time. The members of the Ethics & CSR Committee as well  as  the  Board  of  Management  were regularly informed of the progress of the work.",

The CSR Division has  become  the  Sustainable  Development Department and now reports to the Strategy Department.  The  25  objectives,  divided  into  the  three\n\npillars of the strategy (environment, safety, inclusion), are steered  by  identified  cross-disciplinary  working  groups, and  a  key  performance  indicator  has  been  defined  for each of them.\n\n## A dedicated governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe sustainable development action areas are linked to an Executive  Committee  member  or  a  Group  Management Committee member  and are coordinated by the Sustainable  Development  Department.

This department  reports  to  the  Strategy  and  Business Development Department, whose director is a member of the Renault Group Executive Committee.\n- \u25cf Also  covered  by  the  company's  strategy,  the  Strategy and Environmental Planning Department aims to reduce the  environmental  footprint  and  the  health  impacts  of activities,  products  and  services  over  the  lifecycle  and introduce circular economy business models to boost the Company's medium- and long-term competitiveness.\n- \u25cf The  Human  Resources  Department  is  responsible  for optimizing allocated resources, skills development, employee  involvement,  social  dialog  and  health,  safety, ergonomics  and  environmental  matters  (HSEE),  which implements  Renault  Group's  Health  and  Safety  policy.  Its aim is to achieve zero accidents and occupational illnesses. The  HSEE  Department  also  includes  the  Environment Department,  which  implements  the  strategy  to  reduce\n- environmental risks and impacts (including carbon neutrality)  by  defining  rules,  monitoring  their  application, and leading a network of correspondents.\n- \u25cf The Purchasing Department, in charge of decarbonizing purchased materials and components and implementing the responsible purchasing policy.\n- \u25cf The Engineering Department, which is jointly responsible with the Product Planning Department for the deployment  of  on-board  safety  commitments  in  the Group's vehicles as well as the objectives of electrification and decarbonization of the range.\n- \u25cf The  Manufacturing  Department,  which  is  responsible  in particular for the decarbonization of production sites and more generally for the environmental impact of activities.\n- \u25cf Lastly,  the  management  bodies  of  the  brands  (Renault, Dacia, Alpine, Mobilize) are also deploying the objectives of the new strategy within their business unit.\n- \u25cf Individually or jointly, depending  on  the  crossfunctional  nature  of  the  subjects,  the  Sustainable Development  Department  and  these  operational departments bring issues relating to strategic orientation  before  the  decision-making  bodies  at  the Chief Executive Officer or Group Executive Committee member  level.  These  departments  then  roll  them  out within  the  Company  through  the  programs,  functions and  business  lines,  using  internal  networks  and  by developing external partnerships if necessary.\n\nI\n\nSustainable development\n\n02",

Each year, members must attest to the effective implementation of these  principles  in  a  'progress  communication'  report, which is posted on the Global Compact's website.\n\nTwenty years later, the United Nations Global Compact is the  world's  largest  voluntary  corporate  sustainability initiative, bringing together more than 13,000 participants in 170 countries. Nearly 70 local networks around the world ensure  a  close  relationship  with  members  and  national mobilization.\n\nThe  Global  Compact  is  also  the  starting  point  for  any organization  seeking  to  support  the  17  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015 by the  UN.  These  goals  provide  a  universal  agenda  to  be achieved  by  the  year  2030  for  a  more  sustainable  and inclusive world.\n\nThese 10 principles are inspired by:\n\n- \u25cf the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n- \u25cf the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work;\n- \u25cf the International Labour Organization;\n- \u25cf the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;\n- \u25cf the United Nations Convention against Corruption.\n\n## Our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015 by the Member States of the United Nations, is an  action  plan  designed  to  eradicate  poverty,  protect  the  planet  and  ensure  that  all  human  beings  live  in  peace  and prosperity.  It  is  structured  around  17  Sustainable  Development  Goals  and  169  targets  that  take  into  account  the three aspects of sustainable development: the economy, social aspects and the environment. The latter are aimed at all stakeholders: States, local authorities, civil society, and economic and financial actors.\n\nThrough its geographical footprint, the diversity of its businesses and its commitment to ESG, Renault Group contributes to a greater or lesser extent - to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals identified by the United Nations. Its contribution is highlighted  in  the  table  below,  which  lists  the  targets  to  which  the  company  is  committed  together  with  examples  of initiatives, and highlights the SDGs to which the Group contributes directly: SDGs 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 13 and 16.\n\nI\n\n02",

Spearheaded by  the  Sustainable  Development  Department,  a  groupwide  steering  committee  supervised  the  methodological approach and the key stages  of  the  project.  This  matrix was  validated  in  January  2020  by  the  Group  Executive Committee and by Jean-Dominique S\u00e9nard, Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Methodological approach\n\nThe  materiality  matrix  was  defined  by  management representatives  from  the  Company's  main  departments/ functions, based on internal and external data.\n\nThe  first  stage  of  the  process  was  to  define  the comprehensive list of ESG issues to which Renault Group is faced  as  a  car  maker  and  supplier  of  mobility  services. Numerous  sources  were  consulted  to  prepare  this  list, particularly the ESG rating criteria, competitors' materiality matrices, press articles and interviews with experts.\n\nAll  of  the  issues  collected  were  grouped  into  14  coherent macro-issues.  The  importance  of  each  issue  along  each axis of the matrix was then assessed.\n\nThe  y-axis  represents  the  influence  on  stakeholders' opinions or behavior and classifies the issues according to the  ESG  expectations  of  the  Group's  stakeholders.  The importance of issues along this axis was determined from interviews  with  stakeholder  representatives  (employees, NGOs,  suppliers,  car  dealerships,  start-ups,  researchers, public  sector,  investors)  as  well  as  a  survey  of  3,500 customers in seven countries.\n\nThe  x-axis  illustrates the impact  on  the  Company's sustainable performance and represents the contribution of each  theme  to  long-term  value  creation.  To  assess  the importance of each issue along this axis, internal interviews took place with the Group's General Management,\n\nemployees  in  the  main  departments/functions  and  an internal survey with 200 of Renault Group's top managers.\n\nThe issues were then refined and placed on the materiality matrix during a collaborative workshop bringing together the representatives of the company's main business lines/ functions.\n\nAs in 2015, reducing the total carbon footprint and reducing the impact of the use of vehicles on air quality are Renault Group priorities. Internal and external stakeholders expect the group to continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution due to road transport. They also assessed the impact of these two issues on Renault's longterm  sales  performance  as  critical,  notably  due  to tightened  regulations  and  the  decrease  in  the  societal acceptability of vehicle emissions.\n\nSimilarly,  Improving passenger and road user safety and Limiting the impact on resources particularly through the circular economy remain two major stakeholder expectations,  as  well  as  being  important  issues  to guarantee the Company's performance. These expectations  were  taken  into  account  in  the  new sustainability strategy announced in April 2021.\n\nSome  issues  increased  in  importance  in  the  2020 materiality  matrix.  One  of  the  main  changes  compared with 2015 concerns stakeholder expectations (particularly for investors and  the  public  sector)  on  corporate governance. Guaranteeing robust governance was considered to be an essential prerequisite when undertaking  any  transformation  of  Renault  Group  and was,  therefore,  prioritized  both  in  terms  of  stakeholder expectations and impact on Company performance.\n\nIn a context of changes in skill requirements (related to the electric vehicle, connected and autonomous technologies, etc.) and growing employee expectations in terms of the environment and working methods, Ensuring employee well-being and development is also a growing issue  for  Renault.    This  expectation  was  also  taken  into account  in  the  new  sustainable  development  strategy with the creation of ReKnow University.\n\nIn response to the ongoing transformation of the mobility industry and the growing search for optimization of urban areas,  the  internal  stakeholders  expect  the  Contribution of Renault Group to the transformation of urban mobility to  have  a  more  significant  impact  on  the  Company's performance than in 2015.\n\nStakeholder  expectations  concerning  the  Company's actions  on  Ensuring  respect  for  human  rights  and  work throughout  the  supply  chain  were  also  reinforced compared with 2015.\n\nI\n\nSustainable development\n\n02",

In this context, the Group has introduced a whistleblowing system open to  employees.  The  Group  has  also  chosen  to  open  the whistleblowing  system  to  external  and  occasional employees,  as  well  as  to  suppliers  and  subcontractors with  which  an  established  commercial  relationship exists.  The  global  whistleblowing system is available in\n\n14 languages in the countries. This platform is managed by an external service provider and can be accessed at any  time,  any  day  of  the  week,  on  a  professional  or personal  computer,  tablet  or  smartphone,  via  the Internet at https://renault.whistleb.com. A telephone line managed  by  this  service  provider  is  also  available. It ensures confidentiality of communication  and therefore allows the whistleblower to remain anonymous  subject  to  local  law.  During  2021,  new awareness-raising  initiatives  were  carried  out,  notably on  the  Group's  intranet,  to  remind  people  how  the system works.\n\nThe system enables suppliers and subcontractors to raise an alert in the event of risks concerning  serious infringements  to  human  rights,  fundamental  freedoms, health  and  safety  of  persons  or  the  environment,  in accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  in  force. A reminder of the available possibilities was made in 2021.\n\nEach  report  is  examined  and,  depending  on  the  case, handled locally or by the Deputy Director for Whistleblowing.  The  Whistleblowing  Committee  (CTA), composed  of  seven  members  and  three  experts, collectively  handles  whistleblowing  reports  concerning France  and  the  Corporate  Departments.  In  other countries, alerts are handled by the Country Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECP), chaired by the Country Director.  A  detailed  report  containing  statistics  on whistleblowing  worldwide  is  presented  annually  to  the Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  (CECG)  and the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR).\n\n## 2.1.6 Extra-Financial Performance Declaration\n\nRenault  Group  prepares  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  risks  to  which  the  Company  may  be  exposed,  including  the  extrafinancial risks that may call into question the group's ability to maintain its overall performance. The complete approach and comprehensive information on risks in general are presented in chapter 4 this Universal registration document.\n\n## 2.1.6.1. Extra-financial performance reporting methodology\n\n## Regulatory context\n\nIn  accordance  with  Order  No.  2017-1180  of  July  19,  2017, and  Decree  No.  2017-1265  of  August  9,  2017,  Renault Group has established the Extra-Financial Performance Declaration ('EFPD').\n\nIdentification of the main social, societal and environmental risks of the Group is based on international standards  and  norms  -  such  as  INERIS  and  the  GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) - as well as internal mapping (Group  major  risks,  corruption  risks,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the French 'Sapin II' act, risks relating to the vigilance  plan,  as  well  as  issues  identified  in  the materiality matrix (see 2.1.4)).",

Certain topics have not been identified as  pertinent  principal  risks  in  respect  of  the  Group's activities and shareholders' known expectations, notably those relating to food (food waste, fighting food insecurity, respect  for  animal  welfare  and  responsible,  fair  and sustainable food).\n\nThis  list  of  risks  was  reviewed  by  the  Strategy  and  CSR Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nThis  work  enabled  identification  of  a  list  of  30  principal extra-financial  risks  grouped  within  the  following  five areas:\n\n- \u25cf social;\n- \u25cf societal;\n- \u25cf environmental;\n- \u25cf human rights;\n- \u25cf the fight against corruption and tax evasion.\n\nPolicies,  procedures and the results of these procedures, including performance indicators, have been established for each of these risks.\n\nThe 30 principal risks were categorized as E for the main Environmental  risks,  S  for  Social  and  Societal  and  G  for Governance  and  related  to  the  issues  in  the  materiality matrix (see table in 2.1.4 below).\n\n## Data collection process\n\nEach indicator is associated with a coordinator, generally a  business-line  expert,  who  has  collected,  checked  and consolidated the data within his/her reporting scope.\n\nThe indicators are then initially validated by the manager responsible  for  producing  the  indicator  within  his/her activity, then validated again by the manager of the entity concerned.\n\nAll of  the  data  is  consolidated  by  the  Sustainable Development Department. .\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe  EFPD  target  scope  is  identical  to  that  of  Renault Group's consolidated financial reporting (see section  5.2.2.6,  note  31  to  the  consolidated  financial statements),  namely  Renault  SA,  its  subsidiaries  and controlled entities (within the meaning of Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code). When an indicator does not cover the entire scope, clarifications are provided with the indicator.\n\nDetails on the indicators that are included and excluded from  the  reporting  scope  can  be  found  in  section  2.3.2 and 2.5.1.3.\n\n## True and fair and verifiable data\n\nRenault  Group  has  voluntarily  asked  one  of  its  statutory auditors  to  certify  a  selection  of  the  environmental impacts  of  its  main  industrial,  office  and  logistics  sites since  1999.  This  verification  is  carried  out  with  an equivalent  level  of  assurance  to  the  financial  data (reasonable  assurance  within  the  meaning  of  the  IFAC's ISAE 3000 for extra-financial verification). The indicators covered by the reasonable assurance report are listed in note 2.5.6.\n\nIn  accordance with Order No. 2017-1180 of July 19, 2017, on the  publication  of  extra-financial  information  by  certain large  companies  and  groups  of  companies,  amended successively by Act No. 2018-771 of September 5, 2018, Act No. 2018-898 of October 23, 2018, and Act No. 2018-938 of October 30, 2018, Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017, to implement  Order  No.  2017-1180  of  July  19,  2017,  and  the decision of September 14, 2018, amending the decision of May  13,  2013,  the  Group  appointed  an  independent  third party to verify the compliance of the EFPD (Extra-Financial Performance  Declaration)  and  the  accuracy  of  the information contained therein. This information is incorporated in the Renault SA management report.\n\nI\n\n02",

Top priority: ensuring the health and safety of our employees, customers and partners  DV1a   DV1b\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the Group has been adapting  its organization, in accordance  with  the authorities' instructions, by putting in place the appropriate health measures.\n\nWeekly health committee meetings of all the players (HR, physicians, experts, HSE representatives, general services, site managers, etc.) are held, where decisions are made on the measures to be taken on the sites according to  the  evolution  of  the  pandemic.  They  assess  both  the national  and  international  health  situation  and  issue  a classification  based  on  the  epidemic  situation  of  the countries.  Depending  on  the  country  classification,  the rules are either relaxed or tightened.\n\nThe global health guidelines , developed by the occupational health physicians and services and the HSE (health, safety and environment) Department, are always adapted  and  shared  with  the  sites.  Health  measures include the provision of masks for work and for commutes, the provision of hand sanitizer and the redesign of certain work areas.\n\nInternal communication dedicated to the unfolding health situation  has  been  provided  since  the  beginning  of  the crisis,  notably  via  the  Group's  intranet  portal,  but  also  by e-mail, managerial information kits and posters.\n\nInformation  on  COVID-19  safety  precautions  is  always widely communicated to employees throughout the Group.\n\nThe Group has set up a mask production line, certified to current  standards,  to  meet  its  needs  and  guarantee  the health  and  safety  of  its  employees  at  all  sites  and throughout  the  sales  network  in  Europe (industrial  and tertiary  sites,  the  Renault  dealership  network  and  the private network). This unit, located at the Renault plant in Flins (France), is at full production capacity and can meet the needs of our French sites.\n\nCommercial  activities  have  gradually  resumed  with  the systematic implementation of health measures adapted to  the  development  of  the  epidemic  and  local  laws,  and priority is given to employee health and safety.\n\nIn France ,  the 'Solidarity and Future Contract', signed on April 2, 2020,  has  been  modified  following  further negotiations. The 'Solidarity  and  Future  Contract  2' has made it  possible  to  adapt  the  Group's  operations  to  the economic  situation.  In  particular,  it  provides  for  a guarantee of 100% of employees' net pay in the event of recourse to furlough schemes in return for the deduction of two days' leave to be paid into the solidarity fund and one  day's  leave  for  each  week  off  work.  The  central solidarity  fund  was  created  under  a  former  company agreement to provide a permanent, centralized reserve of days  from  which  sites  using  the  furlough  scheme,  for whatever  reason,  can  draw  to  top  up  the  wages  of  the employees  concerned.  Recourse  to  furlough  measures under  our  Solidarity  and  Future  Contract  2  ended  on August  13  for  our  engineering/support  sites  in  the Paris region.\n\nUnfortunately, we are enduring the semiconductor crisis, which  has  a  very  strong  impact  on  the  production shortage.  This  crisis  is  a  consequence  of  the  pandemic, and  our  factories  are  regularly  closing  due  to  a  lack  of parts.  The  employees affected by these closures benefit from the 'Solidary and Future Contract 2'.\n\nI",

Renault Group environmental policy EFPD7\n\nThere  is  now  a  consensus  on  the  magnitude  of environmental  challenges  and  the  urgency  of  finding solutions. These challenges profoundly affect all economic  activities  and  notably  mobility.  Beyond  the expectations of the stakeholders regarding the transport sector, the ability of Renault Group to propose innovative solutions also provides new  economic opportunities and boosts competitiveness.\n\nThe  automotive  industry  needs  to  address  major environmental issues:\n\n- \u25cf climate change related to greenhouse gas emissions, for  which  the  Paris  COP  21  agreement  has  plotted  an ambitious reduction path;\n- \u25cf resources,  the  limited  availability  of  which  implies changing modes of production and use;\n- \u25cf health,  a  major  concern  (particularly  in  cities),  which requires reduction of pollutant emissions;\n- \u25cf global  biodiversity  loss  caused  by  human-induced pressures on ecosystems.\n\nTo  meet  these  challenges,  Renault  Group  has  had  an environmental  policy  since  the  late  1990s.  It  applies throughout  the  vehicle  lifecycle,  from  design  to  end  of life, and is fully in line with the company's strategic plan (see graphic below).\n\n## RENAULT GROUP ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\n\n## COMMITMENTS\n\n## CREATING VALUE\n\nContribute to the creation of new sources of income and profit through innovative mobility solutions and circular economy activities, contribute to the competitiveness and protection of tangible and intangible assets.\n\n## PREVENTING AND REDUCING\n\nPrevent and continuously reduce the environmental footprint of activities, services and products throughout their lifecycle.\n\nClimate change and energy efficiency\n\nBiodiversity and ecosystems\n\n## STEERING\n\nImplement environmental management across the Group and throughout the value chain in order to ensure continuous improvement and compliance with regulations and voluntary commitments.\n\n## ENGAGING AND COMMUNICATING\n\nEnsure transparent and responsible communication and stakeholder dialogue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The strategy defines  two  major  environmental  priorities:  reducing  green house gas emissions and accelerating the circular economy.\n\nThe climate strategy, also announced at the 2021 General Meeting,  provides  for  an  action  plan  up  to  2030  from upstream  to  downstream  of  the  value  chain,  from  the supply of materials and components to the end of life of vehicles. As vehicle use is responsible for more than 80% of the group's carbon footprint, this phase of the product lifecycle is the priority of the climate plan.\n\nFor each area of action, the group has defined monitoring indicators,  specific  targets  and  action  plans.  These  are detailed in chapter 2.2.2 of this document.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.1.2. Governance EFPD7a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supervision of the environmental strategy (including climate) by the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  oversees  the  definition  and implementation  of  the  Group's  environmental  strategy and the associated risks and opportunities. Each year, the Board examines issues related to climate change, Renault\n\nGroup's  strategy  on  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  the electrification of its product range and the impact of new regulations on greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants.\n\nI\n\nThe transformation of the Flins plant into the Re-Factory, Europe's  first  circular  economy  plant  dedicated  to mobility, is  emblematic of the Group's vision: to rely on a complete recycling and remanufacturing industrial ecosystem that is both a response to the environmental challenge,  particularly  for  the  most  strategic  or  critical materials, and  an  economic  asset  that  generates revenues and profits.\n\nLastly,  the  creation  of  the  Mobilize  brand,  which  aims  to develop  mobility,  data  and  energy  services,  is  another lever for the group's transformation, creating environmental  and  societal  value  through  its  electric shared-mobility solutions and battery services.\n\nThe  group's  environmental  policy  is  a  pillar  of  our engagement and responsible capitalism: it is core to the group's  transformation  and  purpose,  which  integrate economic performance with environmental performance.\n\n02",

The focuses of the environmental  policy  are  discussed  twice  a  year  and arbitrated within the BoM on the proposal of the Director of Strategy and Business Development. For this purpose, the  BoM  relies  on  the  Group  Sustainable  Development Committee.\n\nThe Strategy and Business Development Department is responsible for preparing, deploying and monitoring the implementation  of  the  environmental  policy  in  all sectors of the company throughout its value chain and for each stage in the lifecycle of its vehicles. To this end, it uses a network of correspondents who are assigned to all  Company  departments,  as  well  as  the  networks  of expertise created within the Group in 2010 in areas such as  'energy,  environment  and  raw  materials  strategy', 'vehicle  CO2'  and  'air  quality  and  substances'.  The experts  who  make  up  these  teams  provide  in-depth knowledge  of  strategic  issues  and  an  approach recognized  internally  for  its  rigor,  neutrality  and  crossdisciplinary nature.\n\nThe  roll-out  of  the  environmental  component  of  the strategic plan by the Strategy and Business Development Department thus covers all of Renault Group's activities and supports its development strategy for new products and services.\n\n## Compensation tied to meeting CO2 emissions reduction targets and environmental commitments\n\nIn light of the importance of climate issues for the Group, the  compensation of the executive corporate officer is tied  to  an  environment-related  condition  among  other qualitative criteria.\n\nThe target, introduced in 2013, is 'leadership in environmental performance: CO2 emissions of vehicles in Europe,  Renault  Group  carbon  footprint'.  More  recently, on the recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors proposed  a  change  to  the  compensation  policy  for  the Chief Executive Officer for 2020 and 2021 by adding two new criteria related to this issue:\n\n- \u25cf a  condition  tied  to  meeting  the  European  regulatory target for passenger car CO2 emissions (CAFE standards 1 )  on which short-term variable compensation is based;\n- \u25cf a  condition  tied  to  reducing  the  carbon  footprint  of Renault  Group  registered  passenger  cars  and  light commercial vehicles  worldwide,  excluding  AVTOVAZ 1 , on which long-term compensation, paid in the form of performance shares, is based. The quantitative targets are  aligned  with  the  2017-2022  carbon  footprint reduction  trajectory  and  the  Group's  greenhouse  gas reduction targets for 2030.\n\nIn  2022,  the  compensation  policy  regarding  the  Chief Executive Officer has changed to include the following new environmental criteria:\n\n- \u25cf a  criterion  related  to  the  number  of  used  vehicles reconditioned in Flins (in the annual variable compensation),\n- \u25cf a  criterion  related  to  the  development  of  the  circular economy activity (in the annual variable compensation),\n- \u25cf a criterion related to the Group's electrified passenger vehicle sales mix in Europe, over the period 2022-2024 (in the performance action plan),\n- \u25cf a criterion related to the reduction of kg of CO2 emitted per  vehicle  produced  in  Europe  over  the  period 2023-2025 (in the co-investment plan).\n\n(For more details on the compensation policy regarding the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  see  chapters  3.2.4.2  and 3.2.2.2 of the universal registration document).",

Green Taxonomy EFPD7b\n\nThe  commitment  to  decarbonization  is  a  continuum rather  than  a  shift  for  Renault  Group,  which  has  been committed  to  the  electrification  of  its  vehicles  and  the reduction of emissions in its industrial operations for more than 10 years. The Group's first investments in the energy transition date back to 2009 for electric vehicles and 2015 for  hydrogen.  Today,  more  than  520,000  Renault  and Dacia  electric  vehicles  are  on  the  road.  The  two  brands have a total of 10 different models, from the Twizy small city  car  to  the  Master  light  commercial  vehicle.  Since  its launch  in  Europe  in  2012,  Renault  ZOE  has  dominated  its electric  motor  segment and has sold more than 350,000 units, representing 6 out of 10 of electric vehicles in France. With  more  than  40,000  orders  in  2021,  Dacia  Spring  has once  again  succeeded  in  making  electric  mobility accessible to all. Together, these models have accumulated more than 10 billion zero-emission kilometers  ('tank-to-wheel'  -  see  sections  2.2.2.1.2  and 2.2.2.1.3),  giving  the  Group  an  unrivalled  track  record  in terms  of  number  and  duration  in  the  A  and  B  electric segments in Europe.\n\nThe  Group's  efforts  focus  on  the  entire  life  cycle, especially  work  on  production.  Inaugurated  in  2012,  the Tangier plant was one of the first automotive production sites in the world to move towards 'zero carbon and zero emission'. The decarbonisation of materials and components in the supply chain has also been launched,\n\nparticularly  for  materials  emitting  the  most  carbon  such as  steel  (see  sections  2.2.1.4  and  2.2.2.2)  Lastly,  the introduction of new, more collaborative working methods has  reduced  the  tertiary  real  estate  footprint  and  the emissions  typically  associated  with  it  (see  section 2.2.2.1.2.2.). In terms of governance, the Group's decarbonisation  is  steered  by  the  strategy  department and  presented  in  the  executive  committee  meeting  and has been included in the remuneration of executives and managers since 2018 (see section 2.2.1.2) All these efforts are  now  developed  by  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  of  the European Parliament and of the Council of June 18, 2020, on  the  establishment  of  a  framework  to  facilitate sustainable investment within the European Union, known as 'Taxonomy'.\n\nFor the 2021 financial year, the key figures for the following eligible activities were calculated:\n\n- \u25cf Manufacturing, repairing, maintaining, retrofitting, repurposing and selling vehicles, including those equipped  with  internal  combustion  engines.  The  Group thus complies with the 'Draft Commission notice on the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures  Delegated  Act  under  Article  8  of  EU Taxonomy  Regulation  on  the  reporting  of  eligible economic activities and assets', published on 2 February 2022;\n- \u25cf Financing and leasing of passenger and light commercial  vehicles  (see  section  1.1.6  of  RCi  financial statements).\n\n|                                              | 2021 revenues   | Operational expenditure 2021 (Opex)  (1)   | 2021 investments (Capex)  (1)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Total consolidated Renault Group (\u20ac million) | 46,213          | 1,372                                      | 4,222                           |\n| Vehicle manufacture, repair and sale         | 91%             | 100%                                       | 64%                             |\n| Vehicle leasing and financing                | 4%              | 0%                                         | 36%                             |\n| Total eligible activities                    | 95%             | 100%                                       | 100%                            |\n\nIn  just  over  10  years,  the  Group  and  the  Alliance  have already  invested  more  than  \u20ac10  billion  in  electrification. This  movement  is  accelerating:  the  Alliance  will  invest \u20ac23 billion over the next five years. Thanks to five common electric  platforms  covering  most  segments,  the  Renault brand aims to become 100% electric in 2030. At the Group level,  under  the  Renaulution  plan,  24  vehicles  will  be launched, half of which will be electric. This will be made possible  by  ramping  up  our  ElectriCity  industrial  hub, which consists of three industrial sites in northern France capable of producing and assembling, including batteries, more  than  400,000  electric  vehicles.  This  center  of excellence  will  be  directly  linked  to  the  Megafactory  in Normandy,  which  is  capable  of  delivering  up  to  1  million hybrid or electric motors. In total and by 2026, \u20ac7 billion in R&D  investment  and  expenditure  has  already  been decided  for  the  Group's  transition  to  electrification. Included  in  the  Renaulution,  this  plan  will  lead  to  an increase  in  the  share  of  our  eligible  activities  (see section 2.2.2.1.2).\n\nBeyond  the  electrification of vehicles, the group's decarbonization efforts are also reflected in a responsible sourcing  strategy  regarding  materials  with  the  highest emissions  and  bringing  closer  the  suppliers  of  our assembly  sites.  The  upcoming  application  of  an  internal carbon price in our purchases of parts and materials will enable us to better manage this effort. In total, the Group is  aiming for a 30% reduction in the carbon footprint per kilo of material  purchased  by  2030  and  up  to  a 35% reduction  in  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  battery  (see section  2.2.2.1.2).  In  addition  to  this  responsible  sourcing strategy,  there  are  also  structuring  partnerships  such  as with  Envision  AESC  and  Verkor  in  low-carbon  batteries, Plug Power in hydrogen, Terrafame for nickel supply and Vulcan Energy for low-carbon  lithium supply (see section 2.5.1.2).\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  decarbonisation  of  plants  is continuing with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality for Renault ElectriCity by 2025 and for all our European sites by 2030.\n\nI",

Resources EFPD7B\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  Group  invests  about  \u20ac2.3  billion  in  Research  and Development  every  year.  Most  of  these  resources  are allocated  to  the  development  of  new  low-emission vehicles,  powertrains  and  batteries.  Upstream  of  new vehicle projects, between \u20ac100 million and \u20ac150 million are allocated each year to research and advanced engineering 1 . A  significant  share  of  this  spending  is earmarked for innovations specifically aimed at reducing vehicle emissions (by extending the electric vehicle range), which  is  a  regulatory  imperative,  particularly  in  Europe. Another share is allocated to developing services provided by batteries (second-life use and smart charging).\n\n## 2.2.1.4.2. Lifecycle Assessments\n\nSince  2005,  Renault  has  been  committed  to  reducing  the environmental  impact  of  its  vehicles  throughout  their lifecycle,  from  one  generation  to  the  next.  In  order  to ensure  and  monitor  compliance  with  this  commitment, since  2004,  Renault  Group  measures  the  environmental impact  of  its  vehicles  throughout  their  lifecycle,  from  the extraction of the raw materials needed  for their manufacture until their end-of-life. Lifecycle Assessments (LCA) are therefore performed:\n\n- \u25cf prior  to  the  vehicle  design  process,  to  analyze  the potential environmental  impact  and  benefits  of technological innovations;\n\n1 \u20ac125.5 million in 2021.\n\n- \u25cf after the design process, to confirm and measure the reduction of environmental impacts from one generation of vehicles to another.\n\nAt  end-2021,  34  models  representing  75%  of  the  Group's global passenger car sales under the Renault, Dacia, Alpine and  RSM  (Renault  Samsung  Motors)  brands  were  thus subjected  to  a  complete  LCA.  Starting  with  the  launch  of TWINGO III in September 2014, all new models are subjected to  a  comparative  LCA  with  respect  to  their  predecessor. Each  of  these  LCAs  is  subjected  to  a  critical  review  by  an independent expert following the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards,  to  evaluate,  firstly,  the  methodology  used  and, secondly, all of the calculations and  interpretations performed. The LCA reports for new models, together with their reviews, are posted online on the website https://www.renaultgroup.com/en/our-commitments/.\n\nFor  further  methodological  details,  please  refer  to section 2.5.1.2.\n\nThe chart below presents the results of the comparative lifecycle assessment of New ZOE (2019) and CLIO V (2019), in the form of a comparison by normalization. Normalization consists in measuring the relative weight of the vehicle studied in relation to the environmental impact of  an  'average'  European  citizen  over  a  reference  year. The results of the LCA illustrate the pertinence of electric vehicles  in  the  fight  against  global  warming:  over  the entire lifecycle, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions stands at 28% for ZOE compared with CLIO V, based on an",

With the  electricity  mix  in  France,  the  reduction  was  64%.  The influence of the electricity mix used for charging on the final result is also notable for the acidification potential indicator, with a reduction of 41% for a ZOE charged with the French electricity  mix,  compared  with  a  ZOE  charged  with  the average European mix. Indicators whose relative weight in the  normalization  is  lower  are  nonetheless  useful  for identifying and prioritizing the actions to be taken to reduce environmental  impacts.  Thus,  the  indicator  of  potential\n\ndepletion  of  mineral  resources  shows  a  negative  impact related  to  the  manufacture  of  the  electric  vehicle  traction battery.\n\nTo  meet  this  challenge,  the  Group  is  leveraging  various options: maximizing battery use (smart charging, bidirectional  charging,  second-life  uses  such  as  stationary energy  storage),  and  participating  in  the  development  of new recycling solutions for active battery materials, thereby helping reduce the need for virgin materials.\n\n## LCA COMPARISON BETWEEN CLIO (2019) AND ZOE (2019)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCLIO V\n\nZOE\n\nEuropean citizen (EU 28 average)\n\n## 2.2.1.4.3.

For easier understanding and reading, the stages of the lifecycle have been divided into four main phases:\n\n- \u25cf design;\n- \u25cf manufacture;\n- \u25cf use; and\n- \u25cf end of life.\n\nI\n\n02",

Environmental skills and training\n\nPlant  employees  receive  workstation  training,  including environmental aspects, particularly chemical risks arising from handling, storage and spills, and the sorting of waste.\n\nIn  the majority of plants, this training is done through a specific Dojo (workshop)  and  involves  a  hands-on approach  to  waste  management  practices  and  the\n\nhandling of  chemical  products  in  day-to-day  activities. In addition, educational and awareness-raising activities  on  environmental  protection  regularly  take place  through  internal  communication  channels  or through weekly team meetings.\n\nIn the engineering functions, employees have access to environmental training linked to their business, provided in the form of internal training modules (e.g. training for ISO  14001  auditors  or  design-for-recycling)  or  training provided  by  a  specialized  external  organization  if  a specific  skill  is  required.  Renault  employees  in  France also have access to eco-driving training.\n\n## Climat fresk\n\nIn 2021, more than 160 engineering employees were trained at the climat fresk. These educational workshops based on collective intelligence aim to raise awareness of climate change. In 2022, the continued deployment of these workshops should enable an additional 500 to 1,000 employees to be trained.\n\n## 2.2.1.4.5. Environmental management system in the plants\n\nIn 2021, the industrial environment  network  had approximately  240  members  spread  over  13  countries and  46  sites.  Environmental  management  at  Renault Group plants is underpinned by four pillars:\n\n## 1. Continuous improvement based on ISO 14001\n\nStarting in 1995, Renault began systematically implementing an environmental management approach at its sites, along with  a  drive  for  continuous  improvement,  based  on ISO  14001.  This  was  done  to  reduce  environmental  impact and ensure regulatory compliance. Since 2008, all of Renault Group's  30  industrial  sites  and  the  eight  main  engineering and logistics facilities have been ISO 14001-certified 1 .",

Group-wide tools and standards\n\nIn  order  to  control  these  main  environmental  risks,  as required  by  the  French  vigilance  law,  Renault  Group  has developed a tool called  'Mandatory Rules  Environment'. This  assessment  tool,  deployed  starting  in  2021,  can  be used  to  identify  and  prioritize  environmental  risks  (see 2.3.2.1.4, 'Environment' paragraph).\n\nIndustrial  standards  covering  all  areas  related  to  the environment define the minimum requirements that apply to the Group's sites (see 'Eco-design  of industrial processes' paragraph below). These ensure that practices are standardized and reflect and adhere to the Company's policies  and  objectives  in  terms  of  the  environment,  no matter in which country the plants are located, in particular when  the  plants  are  not  subject  to  a  binding  regulatory framework.\n\nThe 'Mandatory Rules Environment' tool highlights the key points of these standards.\n\nFor  environmental  management  and  the  handling  of chemicals,  the  sites  can  also  rely  on  the  availability  of standardized tools managed  by  expert functions. These tools include:\n\n- \u25cf an expert system called \u00c9corisques, available worldwide in the main languages used within the Group. The system determines  and  ranks  the  environmental  impact  from activities and potential hazards in relation to the plants' chemical  risk and  prioritizes them  in  the  plants' environmental action plan;\n- \u25cf a  reporting  system  for  environmental  impacts  and energy consumption (R2E);\n- \u25cf a  CHEMIS  (Chemical  Information  System)  database, available in  the  main  languages used within the Group, for  the  management of hazardous substances and the prevention  of  chemical  risks.  CHEMIS  is  the  key  tool  in Renault  Group  chemical  risk  management  process, which  aims,  from  both  environmental  and  health standpoints,  to  introduce  chemicals  safely,  to  prevent the  risks  associated  with  their  use,  and  to  anticipate technological and regulatory changes (see 2.2.2.3.2);\n- \u25cf a process to monitor and track compliance with national and EU environmental legislation;\n- \u25cf a  documentary  database  of  Environmental  standards and best practices, accessible from any Group site.\n\n## 3. Eco-design of industrial processes\n\nEach  industrial  project  is  monitored  by  a  trio  of  project managers  who  ensure  that the applicable regulatory requirements  and  the  Group's  technical  policies  in  terms  of\n\nenvironmental  protection  and  industrial  hygiene,  energy optimization and the prevention of fire and explosion risks are taken into account at every step. At any time during the project, it is thus possible to check  and  validate  the  proper consideration of HSE expectations and to sound the alert in the event of deviation in order to define appropriate action plans.\n\nThese technical business policies are based on the state of  the  art  as  well  as  the  most  stringent  international regulatory or normative frameworks (French legislation on installations  classified  for  environmental  protection,  the European industrial  emissions  directive  (IED)  and  REACH regulation,  the  ATEX  directive,  America's  NFPA  fire protection  standards,  etc.)  and  are  updated  regularly. To complement this shared base of minimum requirements applicable to all Group sites, breakthrough technologies  may  be  introduced  on  certain  sites  or projects according to constraints or opportunities related to the local environment.\n\nIn addition  to  new  plants,  applying  eco-design  to manufacturing  processes  can  also  benefit  existing facilities.  Since  2015,  Renault  Group  has  therefore  been conducting the widespread deployment of LED lighting to replace industrial lighting on a number of its sites.\n\nThe  reduction  in  electricity  use  through  the  use  of  LED lighting  can  reach  65  %  compared  with  the  technology  it replaces. For the whole of the Europe scope covered at end2020, this equates to electricity savings of nearly 100,000 MWh for each full year (2021 value available in April).\n\n## 4. Environmental management system audits\n\nSince  the  end  of  the  1990s,  the  Group  has  used  internal environmental audits at all of its industrial facilities as well as its  main engineering and logistics facilities in order to monitor  the  implementation  of  ISO  14001  requirements, and  especially  the  compliance  with  its  own  internal standards  for  the  protection  of  the  environment.  These complement the external audits performed annually by a certified independent body.\n\nInternal audits are therefore conducted by members of the industrial environmental network (environmental managers and business specialists), using joint audits that encourage exchanges of best practice between plants and stimulate improvements in environmental performance.\n\nAs of end-2021, the network had 52 internal environmental auditors  who  were  specifically  trained  and  qualified  in accordance  with  ISO  14001  and  knowledge  of  the  various environmental  topics.  Each  new  auditor  embarks  on  a progressive skills development  path  until  eventually becoming an audit manager.\n\nI",

As such, the 2021 results for some of the environmental  performance  indicators  are  difficult  to compare  with  those  of  previous  years.  Some  indicators relating to the industrial scope are particularly concerned, whether the indicator is expressed in absolute terms or in relation to  the  number of vehicles produced. For example, energy and water consumption at production  facilities is not strictly proportional to\n\nmanufacturing  volumes  ('heel'  effect),  which  led  to  a significant  deterioration  in  performance  per  vehicle produced in both 2020 and 2021 compared with the 2019 levels  (see  2.2.2.1,  'Climate  and  energy  efficiency'  and 2.2.2.4.2,  'Water  consumption  and  quality').  Similarly,  the decrease in the number of vehicles produced has a direct impact on the 'quantity of hazardous waste per vehicle produced'  indicator  (see  2.2.2.2,  'Resources  and  circular economy')  and  on  the  target  for  reducing  emissions  of volatile  organic  compounds  (see  2.2.2.3.1,  'Air  quality'). Similarly, repeated production stoppages require cleaning  operations  on  the  paint  lines  (use  of  solvents), contributing  to  the  increase  in  emissions  of  volatile organic compounds in g/m 2 (see 2.2.2.3.1, 'Air quality').\n\n## 2.2.2.1.

It is broken down into nine major actions over the entire lifecycle  of  vehicles.  They  will  be  gradually  rolled  out across the group until 2030, an interim milestone toward our ambition of carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040 and worldwide  by  2050.

As part of this effort, they are phasing out the sale of ICE vehicles (by 2030 for  the  United  Kingdom  and  by  2040  at  the  latest  for France). Furthermore, the UN predicts that two thirds of the world's  population  will  be  urban  by  2050,  and  cities  are already increasingly restricting access for ICE cars.\n\nIn  order  to  achieve  its target of  electrifying  100%  of  new models of Renault passenger cars by 2025, the company is:\n\n- \u25cf Pooling production across three platforms: CMF-B and CMF-EV (for electric vehicles), CMF-CD.\n- \u25cf Creating ' Renault  ElectriCity ' in northern  France, which  will  be  the  largest,  most  competitive  electric vehicle production center in Europe.\n- 1 Use & fuels and electricity required for use.

In  2021,  Elexent  changed  its  name  to Mobilize  Power Solutions . The  subsidiary  now  operates  in  11  European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK). Historically an expert in charging solutions for businesses,  Mobilize  Power  Solutions  will  start  selling  to individuals in 2022.\n\n## Action #2:\n\n## Become a European leader in hydrogen-powered light commercial vehicles by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith models such as Kangoo, Trafic and Master, Renault is a European leader in light commercial vehicles (LCVs).\n\nThe very strong growth of this market and the tightening of diesel standards have led the Group to develop electric versions for these models.\n\nToday,  the  aim  is  to  improve  performance  in  terms  of range and charging speed.\n\nTo  extend  the  range  of  the  electric  vehicle  without increasing the size of the battery, or even by reducing it, hydrogen  fuel  cell  technology  (Dual  Power)  provides additional zero-emission energy. In addition to charging at electric stations, vehicles can be charged with hydrogen in just a few minutes.\n\nIn June 2021, Renault and Plug Power launched a joint venture named HYVIA to offer a global hydrogen solution providing:\n\n- \u25cf Vehicles with a range of 500 kilometers (WLTP standard) and reduced charging time (less than 5 minutes).\n- \u25cf Complete  turnkey  solutions  for  fuel  cell  commercial vehicles:  charging  stations,  supply  of  green  hydrogen from decarbonized energy.\n\nHYVIA  has  set  a  target  of  achieving  a  30%  share  of  the European hydrogen LCV market by 2030.\n\nThrough  HYVIA,  Renault  Group  plans  to  continue  building strong partnerships in the field of hydrogen. With Faurecia, since  the  end  of  2021,  the  group  has  been  developing hydrogen tanks  for  light  commercial  vehicles.  In  addition, on  the  basis  of  collaborative  projects,  Renault  Group  will\n\ndevelop solutions integrating all public and private players in the production and distribution of energy.\n\nIn addition to mobility, HYVIA will offer fuel cell and charging solutions, manufactured in Flins, France, to other industries.\n\n## Action #3: Deploy hybrid technologies\n\n## across all brands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group  is developing low-emission engines (E-TECH  hybrid  and  gas)  to  complement  its  offer  of electric vehicles.\n\nDeveloped  exclusively,  the  E-TECH  hybrid  technology reduces the fuel consumption of a hybrid engine by 40% compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine in urban cycle. Its E-TECH plug-in hybrid version delivers a zero-emission mobility solution.\n\nAcceleration of the E-TECH hybrid offering:\n\n- \u25cf Launching  three  new  Renault  hybrid  models  in  2021: Captur, Arkana and Megane Sedan.\n- \u25cf Target: 35% Renault hybrid vehicle sales in 2025.\n- \u25cf Deploying  new  technologies  to  further  reduce  hybrid vehicle  emissions:  connectivity,  eco-driving  and  a  zeroemission mode to enable access to low-emission zones.\n\n## Additional action: Further eco-driving aids\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrivers  often  observe  fuel  consumption  deviations  from the approved values (WLTP in Europe).\n\nConsumption  by  vehicles  is  approved  according  to standardized cycles that are representative of usage but do not cover all driving styles (more or less aggressive) or all real driving conditions (use of heating or air conditioning, urban or rural areas, traffic flow, etc.). For an electric  vehicle,  the  same  reasoning  can  be  applied  to electricity  consumption  and  range  (see  appendix  2.5.1.7, 'Emission  standards  for  passenger  vehicles  in  the European Union').\n\nUnder  favorable  driving  and  temperature  conditions,  a driver  with  an  economical  driving  style  (an  'eco'  driver) can achieve the same fuel consumption as a WLTP cycle, which  is  up  to  25%  less  than  an  'average'  driver. A 'dynamic' customer can consume up to 40% more than the 'average' driver and 70% more than an 'eco' driver 1 .\n\nI\n\n02",

These systems perform all or part of the driving tasks.\n\nThe  first  two  generations  of  systems,  becoming  more widespread today, limit consumption by selecting 'Eco Mode', which acts on:\n\n- \u25cf Reduction  of  acceleration  capabilities  under  certain conditions.\n- \u25cf Maximum speed limitation.\n- \u25cf Efficient management of thermal comfort.\n\nThe third-generation technologies, launched on Megane E-TECH  and  Austral  in  2021,  can  take  full  charge  of certain tasks for more energy-efficient driving: eco and predictive  cruise  control,  adjustment  to  terrain,  speed limits, traffic density, etc.\n\n- 2/ Voluntary systems. They make drivers active in their 'eco-driving'  by  providing  information  to  help  them  to consume  less  fuel  or  electricity.  Renault  Group  offers several types:\n- \u25cf 'Eco  Score' :  the  system  evaluates  the  driving  style; drivers become aware of their level of eco-driving and their potential for improvement.\n- \u25cf 'Eco Coach' : the system displays real-time information on  the  vehicle's  operation  on  the  dashboard  (rev counter for internal combustion vehicles, power meter for electric vehicles, instantaneous  and  average consumption)  and  eco-driving  aids  (gear  change,  lift foot  off  accelerator  to  anticipate,  optimal  speed  to reach a green light, etc.).\n- \u25cf 'Eco Challenge' ('Reward'): the system analyses past journeys to generate advice on how to optimize future journeys; the driver can self-assess and compare with others.

Course  participants  are  trained  on  their  own work vehicles, to which a Driving ECO Training System by Renault  device  is  connected.  This  system  allows  all  their driving parameters to be analyzed for real-time measurement  of  progress  made  through  application  of the training knowledge.\n\n## Action #4:\n\n## Increase the rate of use of vehicles by at least 20% through shared mobility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA personal car is actually in use only 10% of the time and loses  half  of  its  value  in  just  three  years.  With  this knowledge, some users are seeking to reduce the overall cost of their travel and turning to new mobility solutions.\n\nOne of these is shared mobility, which optimizes the use of a car and reduces the number of vehicles in circulation, as well as their environmental impact.\n\nWith regard to road transport, 25% of greenhouse gases are emitted during the 'last mile', i.e. during delivery to the end customer.\n\n- In  2021,  Renault  Group  launched  the  Mobilize  brand, dedicated  to  new  shared  mobility  and  energy  supply services.  It  will  have  four  purpose-designed  electric vehicles: two for carsharing, one for ride-hailing, and one for last-mile delivery. EZ-1, one of the vehicles designed for shared use, will be made from 50% recycled materials and will itself be 95% recyclable. In addition to these vehicles, Mobilize will offer the following services:\n- \u25cf Financing  solutions: Facilitate  access  to  new  forms  of mobility by offering dedicated financial services, such as leasing and pay per use.\n- \u25cf Mobility services: Deploy flexible services for transporting goods and people (car-sharing, ride-hailing, last-mile delivery and on-demand transport).\n- \u25cf Energy  ecosystems: Facilitate access  to  charging infrastructure,  smart  charging,  energy  storage  and battery lifecycle management.\n- \u25cf Maintenance and recycling services: Extend the lives of vehicles and batteries and expand second-life use.\n\n2.2.2.1.2.2. Manufacturing actions - Scope 1+2 and Scope 3 Upstream\n\n## Action #5: Accelerate the deployment of higher performing, low-carbon, reusable batteries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccording to the French agency for ecological transition (ADEME),  producing  the  battery  of  an  electric  car accounts for a third of its carbon footprint due to the use of  electricity  from  fossil  fuels  and  the  extraction  of strategic raw materials such as cobalt and lithium.\n\nStarting  in  2024,  the  European  Union  will  require  battery manufacturers to measure this footprint over a battery's lifecycle,  from  production  to  recycling.  A  European  draft regulation  plans  to  set  a  maximum  carbon  footprint threshold for batteries put on the market by 2027.\n\nRenault  Group  intends  to  accelerate  the  deployment  of more  efficient,  low-carbon,  reusable  batteries  by  acting on their entire lifecycle:\n\n- \u25cf Low-carbon  battery  production: in association  with suppliers, reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  battery production by using decarbonized energy and materials. In  this  respect,  Renault  Group  signed  two  agreements with  material  suppliers  in  2021:  with  Terrafame  for  a sustainable nickel supply (low carbon and traceability of the entire supply chain) and with Vulcan for less carbonintensive  lithium.  Renault  Group  aims  to  reduce  the carbon  footprint  of  the  new  R5's  battery  by  20% compared  with  the  ZOE's  by  2025.  The  reduction  is expected to reach 35% in 2030.\n- \u25cf Maintenance: deployment  of  battery  repair  centers during their first life (around thirty operate as of the end of 2021, including a center of expertise and repair within the Flins Re-Factory). Launch on December 1, 2021, of an offering  of  second-hand  batteries  for  the  repair  of electric vehicles.\n- \u25cf Second  life : repurposing  batteries  for  the  stationary storage  of  renewable  energy,  mobile  solutions  (boats, cooling  systems,  airport  machinery).  In  2021,  Renault Group  entered  into  a  partnership  with  'Betteries',  a start-up specializing in the recovery and use of batteries from  electric  vehicles.  Betteries  uses  recycled  EV batteries  to  develop  transportable  electric  generators suitable  for  a  variety  of  purposes  (e.g.  on  construction sites or in food trucks). These systems are assembled at the  Flins  Re-Factory.  These  second-life  uses  of  our batteries make it possible to avoid GHG emissions.\n- \u25cf Recycling: closed-loop  recycling  of  strategic  materials (cobalt, nickel, lithium) to produce  new  batteries. For these three materials, Renault Group plans to reach 80%  of recycled material reintegrated into the production  of  new  batteries  by  2030  (closed  loop).

Engaging all  its  suppliers  in  active  efforts  to  reduce  their  own environmental footprint is a priority for Renault Group's climate strategy.\n\nRenault  Group  has  set  a  target  of  reducing  CO2e/kg emissions in the parts and materials supply chain by 30% by 2030 compared with 2019. To achieve this, Renault Group is working  with  its suppliers on six priority areas  for improvement:\n\n- \u25cf Area 1: Set  up  a  carbon  footprint  assessment  system using outside surveys conducted by an accredited CDP supply chain organization.\n- \u25cf Area  2: Require  suppliers  to  make  CSR  commitments and  have  their  performance  assessed  by  an  outside organization.\n- \u25cf Area  3: Identify  the  six  highest-emitting  commodities (materials and parts) and implement a joint action plan with suppliers to design a lower-GHG process.\n- \u25cf Area  4: Co-develop  a  co-innovation  policy  to  invent new  technologies  to  meet  future  regulations  and consumer expectations.\n- \u25cf Area 5: Increase local sourcing for production plants.\n- \u25cf Area  6: Establish  internal  carbon  pricing  for  the selection of materials and other procurement decisions.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2020,  Renault  Group became a signatory of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) to foster a virtuous cycle for the supply of raw materials.\n\n## Action #7:\n\n## Strengthening Renault Group's circular economy leadership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the  fight  against  climate  change,  the  circular economy is an essential lever because greenhouse gas emissions  can  be  avoided.  The  circular  economy\n\nstrategy and indicators are set out in chapter 2.2.2.2 of this document ('Resources and circular economies').\n\nThis  work  includes  increasing  the  use  of  recycled materials in  the  manufacture  of  vehicles.  Objective:  All new vehicles worldwide to be made with 33% recycled materials by 2030.\n\n## Action #8:\n\n## Halve our sites' emissions between 2019 and 2030 (scopes 1 and 2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBeyond the issue of constantly fluctuating fossil fuel prices, the  transition  to  low-carbon  energy  and  the  reduction  of consumption are pivotal to shaping the climate trajectory and driving competitiveness (energy savings).\n\nThat  is  why  it  is  being  managed  by  a  dedicated corporate  team,  via  a  network  of  energy  managers deployed  across  all  Group  sites,  according  to  an organization  based  on  the  principles  of  ISO  50001 (although Renault has not chosen to undertake a global certification procedure in respect of this standard, only the  sites  of  Bursa  and  Cl\u00e9on  are  currently  certified) outlined in the diagram below. In 2021, the energy-saving and managed-performance approach was extended to the tertiary and logistics sites.\n\n## Five drivers:\n\n- 1. Industrial footprint: More compact sites will lead to a reduction of space to be lit and heated. Work to this end began at the Douai site in 2021.\n- 2. Manufacturing  processes: Development  of  more energy-efficient processes.\n- 3. Energy  management  4.0: Tools  for  analysis  and management of consumption data with the support of artificial intelligence.\n- 4. Reducing  energy  losses: Recover  and  reuse  of  energy (especially for heat/ventilation/manufacturing process).\n- 5. Renewable  electricity: Target  set  in  2021  to  reach 100%  of  our  sites  powered  by  renewable  energy  in France,  Spain,  Slovenia  and  Portugal  by  2030.  In April  2021,  Renault  Group  signed  a  contract  with  the energy supplier Iberdrola to cover 100% of its energy consumption in Spain with renewable energy (details in 2.2.2.1.3).\n\nRenault  Group  thus  aims  to  remain,  at  least  until  2030, among the world's top 3 manufacturers in terms of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions at its industrial sites.\n\n2030  is  also  the  target  date  for  achieving  carbon neutrality  at  all  European  sites  (2025  for  sites  and activities related to the production of electric vehicles at ElectriCity, France).",

It  unites  the  community  of shippers  in  efforts  to  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of freight. In 2019, the Group was awarded the EVE Trophy by ADEME for the biggest improvement in reducing CO2 emissions  from  transport  and  decided  to  commit  to FRET21 a second time (between 2019 and 2021 on a 2018 baseline).  Today,  it  is  working  to  further  reduce  the carbon  footprint  of  transportation,  logistics  platforms and its packaging.\n\n2021-2030  action  plan  built  on  4  pillars  across  the logistics chain:\n\n- \u25cf Deployment  of  biogas  and  biofuel  trucks starting  in 2021,  followed  by  electric  and  hydrogen-powered trucks starting in 2025.\n- \u25cf Scaling-up  of  multimodal  transportation , in  part  by increasing the share of rail freight.\n- \u25cf Reduction  in  the  number  of  kilometers  traveled  per cubic  meter  of  goods thanks  to  more  optimized  and innovative trucks (double-decker trucks, multipurpose trucks, etc.), the integration of a CO2 transport criterion in new vehicle projects and the optimization of loading.\n- \u25cf Rational  management  of  packaging : reducing  its weight,  returning  used  packaging,  minimizing  waste, increasing the share of recycled material in packaging and eventual elimination of single-use plastics.\n\nTogether,  these  actions  have  allowed  more  than 345,000  metric  tons  of  CO2e  emission  to  be  avoided (cumulative over the period 2017-2021).\n\nBeyond  the  2021-2030  action  plan,  Renault  Group expects to further avoid emissions through the development  of  packaging  recycling  channels,  both within the Group and with its suppliers.\n\nIn addition, Renault Group entered into a partnership in 2018  with  NEOLINE,  a  French  start-up  developing  windpowered cargo ships. Pilot ships are planned for 2024.\n\n2.2.2.1.2.3. Tools and processes in place to manage risks and opportunities\n\n## Monitor the reduction of CO2 emissions from vehicles: CAFE Control Tower\n\nIn 2018, Renault Group created a specific program team called the CAFE Control Tower to monitor the results in Europe and oversee the 2022 roadmap.\n\nStarting  in  2019,  the  Group  also  developed  a  tool  to forecast CO2 levels for its registered vehicles in Europe.\n\nThe CAFE Control Tower reports its results to the Board of Management (BoM) every month.\n\nOutside  Europe,  the  Group  is  subject  to  regulatory standards similar to those in Europe. In total, around 70% of the Group's sales worldwide are thus subject to CAFEtype regulations.\n\nThe strategy and organization described above enabled the  Group  to  achieve  its  CAFE  Europe  targets  for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2021 1 .\n\nIn addition, vehicle CO2e emissions are closely monitored  via  the  global  carbon  footprint  KPI,  and specific  product  competitiveness  targets  are  set  in terms of fuel consumption and CO2e emissions. The BoM reviews  these  indicators  each  year  to  ensure  their alignment with short-, medium- and long-term strategy.\n\n## Making strategic choices to manage GHG emissions reduction: Internal Carbon Pricing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  uses  an  internal  carbon  pricing  (ICP) mechanism to drive the reduction in its CO2e emissions and internalize the economic cost of its greenhouse gas emissions.  This  internal  price  depends  on  the  scope being considered:\n\n- \u25cf For  new  vehicle  projects , the  definition  of  the  ICP notably includes regulations on emissions in use such as  CAFE  and  CO2-related  taxation.  In  Europe,  the carbon price is around \u20ac450/metric ton.\n- \u25cf For industrial installations ,  the  ICP  takes into account multiple  factors  such  as  expected  changes  in  the energy  market  and  CO2  emissions  allowances:  over half of the Group's direct emissions are subject to the EU-ETS  Emissions  Trading  System,  for  which  the average  price  in  2021  increased  from  \u20ac30  to  \u20ac90. Eleven  Group  industrial  sites  are  subject  to  the EU Emissions  Trading  Scheme  (EU-ETS) .  The  associated financial  stakes  are  managed  by  a  special  steering committee.  Against  a  background  of  the  gradual elimination  by  the  European  Commission  of  the  free allocation of EU-ETS quotas and a sharp increase in the price of quotas on the markets, the strategy implemented  by  Renault  Group  aims  to  minimize  the financial costs that these quotas cause in the medium and  long  term,  through  efforts  to  reduce  the  energy consumption  of  the  sites  (see  above)  and  rigorous forward-looking  management.  South  Korea  has  also implemented an emissions trading system since 2015, to  which  the  Busan  manufacturing  site  has  been subject  since  then.  Thanks  to  the  emission-reduction measures  undertaken  before  the  entry  into  force  of these  regulations,  the  Group  did  not  need  to  acquire additional  allowances.  Starting  in  2021,  the  Giheung site  is  also  subject  to  it  and  has  not  resorted  to purchasing allowances either.\n- \u25cf For  the  supply  of  parts  and  materials ,  an  ICP  will  be defined soon (estimated at \u20ac100/teqCO2 in 2030).",

In Europe, the CAFE emissions target of 95 g CO2/km in  2020  was  adjusted  in  2021  to  apply  the  WLTP  standard.  In  the  event  of  non-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Regulatory  and compliance risks                 |               |                         |             | compliance, a penalty payment of \u20ac95 per excess gram per vehicle sold is due.

Regulatory  changes  may  also  introduce traffic  bans  or  restrictions  for  certain  vehicles.  These  changes  may  impact R&D costs and/or production costs, arising from the need to adapt our vehicles to the new standards. The Group is building its offering around lesser-polluting vehicles, in particular by expanding  electric  vehicle  ranges  and  designing  hybrid  solutions  for  internal combustion engines.

The  necessary  modernization  of  plants  to  increase  their  energy  efficiency  may push up production and R&D costs. Combined with regulatory changes, the transition to a low-carbon economy may                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Reputational risks                               |               |                         |             | concern for all stakeholders (employees, NGOs, users, etc.).

The  'Climate' working group identified the risks related to climate change (including  transition  and  physical  risks),  built  scenarios, assessed  the  impacts  of  each  risk  on  Group  performance under each scenario and developed action plans.\n\nStarting in 2015, work on a materiality matrix had made it possible  to  identify  'material'  issues,  i.e.  those  that  will have  a  major  impact  on  the  group's  ecosystem  and  its performance, on which it  will  therefore  have  to  focus  its efforts. This matrix was updated in 2020 (see section 2.1.4). 'Reducing the total carbon footprint' is a top priority for Renault Group. Internal and external stakeholders expect the  group  to  continue  its  efforts  to  reduce  greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nI",

How the Group manages climate risks\n\nIdentifying and managing risks relating to the environment and to climate change are a part of the Group's global risk management  system,  which  is  supervised  by  the  Risk Management Department. The Group's risk management system is detailed in section 4.1\n\nThe risk management method applied by Renault Group is based on identifying and assessing risks of any kind, which are  then  mapped  (as  mentioned  earlier),  and  on  carrying out  action  plans  to  deal  with  these  risks,  and  specifically their  net  impact  and/or  probability  of  occurrence,  by means of elimination, prevention, protection or transfer.\n\nIn 2021, the  risks  related  to  global  warming  were introduced as such in the mapping of the Group's major\n\nrisks  in  order  to  strengthen  their  visibility  and  the management of the associated action plans (see chapter 4.2.1  of  this  document).  As  such,  with  regard  to  physical risks, the actions undertaken in the monitoring of existing risks (e.g. risk of natural disasters or risk to raw materials) were  supplemented  by  cross-cutting  initiatives  such  as the launch of a study of the vulnerability of the industrial and  logistics  sites  in  connection  with  the  climate scenarios mentioned above.\n\nRisk  management  policy  is  applied  at  Group  level  for major risks, but it is also rolled out at operating entity level (countries, commercial and/or industrial subsidiaries), for vehicle programs and corporate functions.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.

The extraction and processing of raw materials have negative impacts  on  ecosystems  and  reduce  their  availability  for future  generations  (see  4.2.2,  'Risk  of  failure  in  supply  of raw  materials'  paragraph).  At  the  same  time,  the  rising trend observed in raw material prices since the beginning of  the  century  and  their  volatility  affects  the  profitability of  the  business.  Circular  economy  principles  reduce  the group's  exposure  to  resource  scarcity  and  commodity price volatility through:\n\n- \u25cf eco-design  standards  for  both  vehicles  and  batteries, including  frugal  use  of  scarce  materials,  incorporating recycled  materials,  preparing  vehicles  for  dismantling and end-of-life recycling;\n- \u25cf projects  that  aim  to  develop  and  implement  new technical solutions and industrial channels for collection, reuse,  renovation  and  recycling  of  parts  and  materials. These projects make it possible to expand the range of reused or remanufactured parts on offer, second-life use and recycling of electrical vehicle batteries, and setting up recycling closed loops within the automotive sector;\n- \u25cf plans  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  industrial  processes allowing resource use to be optimized and waste to be minimized and recovered.\n\nRenault  Group  also  avoids  using  mineral  resources  from conflict  zones  (see  2.4.2,  'Strengthening  the  responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RE-FACTORY, the first European circular economy plant dedicated to mobility\n\nIn November 2020, Renault Group announced the creation of the RE-FACTORY at its site in Flins. This project is part of the group's transformation  strategy  and  builds  on  its  pioneering  commitment  to  the  circular  economy.  It  aims  to  develop  a  competitive industrial model for sustainable mobility, based on the value-creation potential generated by a vehicle throughout its life. The rollout of the new activities, initiated in 2021, will continue until 2025.\n\nThe RE-FACTORY will rely on a large network of multi-sector partners (start-ups, academic partners, major groups, local authorities, etc.) and will be structured around four areas of activity.\n\nRE-TROFIT: This division will combine all the activities making it possible to extend the life of vehicles and their uses, in coordination with the Re-Cycle division, to ensure efficient management of the flow of used parts and materials within the company on a single site. Since the end of 2020, it has included a used vehicle factory for the reconditioning of used vehicles. In addition, retrofit activities will  be  carried out to convert combustion-engine vehicles to less carbon-intensive energy sources, as well as vehicle fleet repair services, in particular for car-sharing.\n\nRE-ENERGY: The  aim  of  this  division  is  to  scale  up  innovative  applications  using  electric  vehicle  batteries  and  new  low-carbon energies: assessment and repair of electric vehicle batteries, dismantling of end-of-life batteries and reuse of their components, development of second-life applications such as stationary electric  energy  storage,  industrialization  of  hydrogen  fuel  cells  and charging infrastructure for low-carbon vehicles.\n\nRE-CYCLE: This  division,  including  the  remanufacturing  workshops  transferred  from  the  Choisy-le-Roi  site,  will  bring  together various activities contributing to the efficient management of materials: dismantling of end-of-life vehicles, reuse and renovation of automotive components, closed-loop recycling of materials from the various RE-FACTORY divisions and the INDRA network.\n\nRE-START: To promote and develop industrial know-how, but also to accelerate research and innovation in the circular economy, this division will house an incubator as well as a training center dedicated to circular economy professions. It will also include an advanced manufacturing activity with retrofit services for industrial robots and production of parts from 3D printers.\n\nMetals  and  plastics  make  up  more  than  85%  of  the materials in automobiles. In 2021, approximately 2.5 million metric tons of steel, 185,000 metric tons of cast iron, and 231,000 metric tons of aluminum were used to manufacture  vehicles  in  the  group's  plants 1 and  by  its parts suppliers. These estimated figures include offcuts of sheet  metal  and  metal  shavings  generated  during\n\nsupplier parts manufacturing processes and in Renault's plants.  In  addition,  Renault  Group  used  about  310,000 metric  tons  of  plastic  materials,  including  offcuts,  in vehicle manufacturing in 2021. Among the materials used in  the  plants  in  the  Europe  and  North  Africa  Regions (approximately  two  thirds  of  the  quantities  above),  it  is estimated  that  the  portion  of  recycled  steel  materials\n\nI\n\n02",

The  recycled  materials  rate  for aluminum varies considerably according to the processes  used  to  manufacture  the  parts:  it  is  nearly\n\n100 %  for  aluminum  foundries  and  secondary  smelting and nearly 40 % for pressed aluminum parts manufactured  internally.  The  mass  of  recycled  plastic averaged around 19 kg per vehicle in 2021.\n\n## Renault is a partner of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and member of the RECORD network\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation works with businesses, universities and decision makers to promote circular economic models and develop the scientific and managerial knowledge required for their adoption and to advise on the potential for economic and environmental benefits.\n\nAs  a  founding  partner  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation,  Renault  contributes  to  its  funding,  supports  the  work  and  events coordinated by the Foundation and develops activities based on the principles of the circular economy, such as the Re-Factory and the activities of Renault Environnement.\n\nFor more information: www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org\n\nIn addition, Renault Group has been a founding member of the RECORD network since 1989 and currently holds one of the two vice-chair  positions.  RECORD  is  a  recognized  player  in  France  in  applied  research  in  the  field  of  end-of-life  product management, waste management and resource efficiency in a circular economy perspective.\n\nFor more information: https://record-net.org/\n\n## 2.2.2.2.1. Designing vehicles that are recyclable and material-efficient\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault anticipated the European regulatory requirement whereby  95%  of  vehicle  mass  should  be  recyclable  or recoverable and implemented it on all models brought to market starting in 2007. In addition, it has been voluntarily applied to all group vehicles sold worldwide.\n\nAccordingly, since the early 2000s, the design of Renault vehicles has taken dismantling and recycling requirements  into  account.  For  example,  dismantling has been made easier by reducing the number of fixing points.  Similarly,  preference  is  given  to  recyclable\n\nmaterials  for  which  recycling  systems  exist;  whenever possible,  a  single  part  will  not  contain  materials  that cannot  be  recycled  together;  and  tanks  are  shaped  to allow  all  fuel  and  oil  to  be  removed.  During  the  design phase,  every  new  vehicle  project  is  monitored  by  a recycling specialist.\n\nRenault also participates in research projects aimed at developing new recycled and recyclable materials (see box in the 'Recycling' paragraph in this same section).\n\nThe possibility of renovating powertrains or certain of their parts  (remanufacturing)  is  also  taken  into  consideration from  the  beginning  of  their  design  by  facilitating  the dismantling and assessment of their components.\n\nRenault Group is also working on reducing the amount of materials used in manufacturing its vehicles.\n\n## Reducing our dependence on rare earths\n\nSince permanent magnets often contain rare earths, the group has moved toward engines that do not contain them where possible. Since 2011, the company has chosen externally excited synchronous motors for its 100% electric vehicles, a technology that does not require a permanent magnet.\n\nIn  addition,  when  feasible,  the  group  chooses  materials  other  than  rare  earths  in  its  magnets,  for  example,  ferrite  for applications such as speakers.\n\nRenault  Group  is  also  reducing  the  use  of  the  most  critical  rare  earths  through  technological  innovations.  For  example,  the group's consumption of Dysprosium (a heavy rare earth) decreased by 65% between 2011 and 2016. The group strives to replace heavy rare earths (more critical in terms of supply) with light rare earths when possible.\n\nLastly, Renault is working on projects to recycle rare earths with the aim of reducing its dependence on the extraction of these minerals.",

Reducing at source and recovering waste\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the circular economy, Renault  has  adopted  a  preventive  approach  to  achieve the  maximum  reduction  in  the  environmental  impacts associated with waste, through the implementation of the following principles, in order of priority:\n\n- \u25cf reduce the  quantity  of  waste  generated  at  source,  by first eliminating  the  source  of  its  creation,  where possible: this means that the use of durable packaging in the  transportation  of  manufacturing  parts  is  favored over that of single-use packaging, particularly for highvolume  parts  and  short  logistical  flows  (the  economic and  carbon  assessments  incorporating  the  return  of empty  packaging  are  not  favorable  for  low  volumes transported over long distances).\n\nWhen the production of waste cannot be avoided, we seek to reduce the amount by separating the portion that is not waste per se (e.g. dehydration of sludge from the painting process  and  water  treatment  plants,  separation  of reusable oils from sludge and machining chips, etc.). The installation  of  a  third  evapo-concentrator  at  the  Cl\u00e9on plant in early 2020 made it possible to reduce the tonnage of hazardous waste by around 10%;\n\n- \u25cf reuse spent  products,  production  offcuts  and  scrap:  in assembly plants, excess anti-corrosion protection waxes  are  recovered  after  application,  filtered  and returned  to  the  production  system.  Following  the implementation of regeneration of solvents used to rinse the  painting  robots  on  most  sites,  the  reuse  of  these regenerated solvents in the paint lines is now in place at the  Batilly,  Maubeuge,  Flins,  Sandouville  (France)  and Valladolid  (Spain)  sites.  In  Colombia,  the  Medellin  plant has  been  recycling  its  paint  solvents  internally  since 2014,  enabling  the  plant  to  eliminate  almost  all  solvent waste.  As  regards  powertrain  manufacturing  sites,  the\n\nSustainable development\n\nCl\u00e9on plant collects and regenerates used stamping and hydraulic oils from the Flins plant to use as a substitute for new oils. When they are in good condition, used wood pallets are reused within the Company or resold for the same purpose;\n\n- \u25cf recycle the  materials contained in the waste. This form of waste treatment can be applied to most recoverable materials  (cardboard,  plastic,  metal,  etc.).  In  this  way, metallic waste, which represents more than 70% 1 of  the total  production  waste,  is  almost  completely  recycled. Paper,  cardboard  and  plastics  are  also  systematically sorted for recycling. However, beyond these 'traditional' recyclable waste categories, some more complex types of waste that may initially appear of no value can also be recycled  through  incorporation  in  the  composition  of new materials;\n- \u25cf recover energetically:\n- \u25cf by using waste as an alternative fuel: as an example, the site at Flins, since 2017, has been sending part of its hazardous  waste  (approximately  115  metric  tons  in 2021) to a facility for the preparation of substitute solid fuel (SSF) supplied to cement works as an alternative to fuel oil for the combustion units;\n- \u25cf or  by  recovering  energy  from  its  incineration  to produce electricity or steam; this in turn can be used to replace natural gas for heating paint drying ovens, as is  the case at the Sandouville plant in France and the Busan plant in South Korea;\n- \u25cf dispose by  burning  waste  (without  energy  recovery)  in incineration facilities  or  burying  it  in  landfills.  Renault  is seeking to minimize the use of this waste management method.  Based  on  a  like-for-like  scope  of  operations, Renault  has  reduced  the  quantities  of  manufacturing waste  sent  to  landfill  (except  demolition  waste  and foundries) by 67% since 2013.\n\nTo ensure consistency at a group-wide level, Renault has drafted a waste table (a codified list of waste produced by sites). This makes it possible to standardize the approach to hazardous and non-hazardous waste internationally.\n\nI\n\n02",

Collect, sort, dismantle, distribute\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCollection is  an  essential  step  in  the  recycling  of  end-oflife  products.  In  addition  to  its  regulatory  obligations, Renault has chosen to invest directly in the collection and processing  networks  for  ELVs  (end-of-life  vehicles)  in France (45% of the group's European end-of-life vehicles are located here due to Renault's long-term establishment in  the  country) in  order to retain economic and technical control of material flows.\n\nThus,  in  2008  the  subsidiary  Renault  Environnement committed itself,  along  with  the  Suez  group,  by  taking  a 50% stake in  Indra.  Indra  has  been  active  in  automotive dismantling for over 30 years, and is involved in all levels of automobile  dismantling,  through  four  complementary activity clusters:\n\n- \u25cf engineering:  Indra  designs,  develops,  produces  and markets  innovative  tools,  equipment  and  processes (developped and tested at their own dismantling site in Romorantin) that deal with pollution removal, dismantling  and  recycling  of  ELVs.  These  tools  and methods are intended to be widely  distributed  to  all  of Indra's  dismantling  network  through  training  programs that  the  Company  develops  and  provides  through  its AURECA  Training  Center  founded  in  2021  (635  people were trained in 2021);\n- \u25cf management/distribution  of  end-of-life  vehicles  for carmakers,  insurers,  Government,  and  even  individuals through its 373 authorized ELV centers (+7 between 2020 and 2021);\n- \u25cf dismantling/recycling in its own dismantling centers;\n- \u25cf sale of refurbished parts under warranty: Indra distributes  certified,  reusable  parts  dismantled  at  its sites through its network.\n\nAccording  to  data  available  at  the  date  of  publication, around 500,000 end-of-life vehicles were processed in 2021 by Indra's network of authorized dismantlers or by its own dismantling  sites,  of  which  more  than  25,000  via  the goodbye-car.com  website,  which  offers  a  'turnkey'  ELV collection service aimed at retail customers.\n\nRenault has invested in these activities in order to meet a three-pronged goal:\n\n- \u25cf to  meet  Renault's  regulatory  requirements  concerning ELV collection and processing in France;\n- \u25cf to improve the technical and economic performance of the  network,  thereby  achieving  the  European  goal  of  a cost-efficient  95%  vehicle  recycling  and  recovery  rate, through the development of new dismantling tools and processes  for  ELVs,  and  supporting  and  training  its automotive dismantling network;\n- \u25cf to  feed  recycling  closed  loops  (see  the  'Recycling' paragraph below) in order to reduce dependence on and consumption of virgin raw materials.\n\nI",

Reuse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  subsidiary  GAIA  collects  unused  parts  in  the  sales network as well as at the plants and suppliers' facilities, sorts  them  and,  depending  on  their  condition,  directs them  to  reuse,  remanufacturing  or,  failing  that,  to  the most appropriate recycling system.\n\nIn France, Renault has offered used body parts (including hoods,  wings,  headlamp  units,  etc.)  collected  and selected from Indra's network of dismantlers since 2012.\n\nTo facilitate access to refurbished parts, Indra has also developed  the  PRECIS  system,  in  partnership  with Sidexa.  This  was  put  into  service  in  France  in  2014  and enables a pooled inventory of premium  quality refurbished parts for repairers to be created, supplied by the Indra network ELV centers. When pricing the repairs to be carried out on vehicles, repairers are automatically informed by the PRECIS module of Sidexa's Pacte Office software (market leader in calculation software) of the existence  of  refurbished  parts  available  in  the  pooled inventory. This reduces  the  cost  of  repair  while maintaining  the  same  level  of  guarantees.  This  offer allows the repair of vehicles for which repair would not have  otherwise  been  economically  viable  using  new parts  alone,  thus  extending  the  vehicle  life  while  very significantly reducing the environmental footprint associated with the repairs.\n\nRevenue  generated  through  the  PRECIS  system  totaled \u20ac7.9 million in 2021, up by around 34% from 2020. Changes in  purchasing  behavior  during  the  pandemic  period  are having  a  positive  impact  on  the  demand  for  refurbished parts, especially through distance selling. The deployment of the PRECIS solution within the INDRA dealer network is a major  contribution  to  these  results.  This  activity  has significant  potential  for  growth,  given  the  continued  low penetration of used parts in the repair market.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.5. Remanufacturing and reconditioning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  has  been  remanufacturing  or  renovating mechanical parts for more than 70 years. Used parts are collected  in  the  sales  network,  sorted  and  refurbished. Since  1949,  the  renovation  of  engines  and  manual gearboxes  has  been  carried  out  at  the  Choisy-le-Roi (France) plant. This activity adheres to a strict industrial process: involving complete  dismantling,  cleaning, sorting,  refurbishment  and  replacement  of  faulty  or worn  parts,  reassembly  and  inspection.  Parts  that cannot  be  reused  during  renovation  undergo  closedloop recycling in Renault Group foundries.\n\nIn the  first  half  of  2022,  the  Choisy-le-Roi  plant's activities will be transferred to the Re-Factory in Flins.\n\nThese  renovated  'Standard  Exchange'  parts  are  sold  to Renault  and  Dacia  vehicle  owners  at  a  price  that  is,  on\n\naverage, 30% lower than that of a new part, while satisfying the same quality requirements. Far from being marginal, the standard  exchange  parts  offering  covers  nearly  70%  of powertrain parts and up to 50% of ground contact parts and is regularly extended to cover new parts categories.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.6. Recycling: develop new recycling routes, use recycled materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  circular economy, Renault's objective is to ensure not only that waste  from  the  automotive  industry  is  recycled  but, whenever  possible,  that  it  is  recycled  within  the automotive industry itself (closed loop). The challenge is to maintain the technical qualities and economic value of materials during recycling.\n\nAt end-2021, the closed-loop networks set up by Renault included:\n\n- \u25cf copper  recycling:  the  wire  bought  back  from  the dismantlers of end-of-life vehicles by GAIA is processed  to  recover  the  copper.  The  copper  is  then resold  either  to  the  Fonderie  de  Bretagne  (Renault Group)  for  the  production  of  pearlitic  cast  iron  or  to auto  industry  suppliers  for  aluminum  processing.  The copper recycled by GAIA is of a high-quality, enabling it to  meet  demanding  technical  specifications  and  to replace virgin or post-industrial material;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  polypropylene  (plastic  material):  GAIA collects  bumpers  from  dismantlers  and  garages  and ensures that they are processed in order to meet the Renault-Nissan  Alliance's  technical  specifications. Seven  grades  of  polypropylene  provided  by  this recycling  network  have  been  listed  with  the  Renault Materials  Panel,  of  which  three  are  used  for  mass production applications and four are currently awaiting approval for new vehicle projects;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  metallic  waste  from  manufacturing  (sheet metal, shavings from machining). Loops between Renault plants or between Renault plants and suppliers of metal parts have been set up in France, Spain and Brazil;\n- \u25cf recycling  of  platinum-group  metals.  GAIA  collects catalytic  converters  from  end-of-life  vehicles  from dismantlers, from which it extracts the platinum-group metals. These recycled metals are then sold to an auto industry supplier to be re-used in the manufacturing of catalytic converters.\n\nThese  closed  loops  contribute  to  the  achievement  of Renault's objectives for the use of recycled materials in new  vehicles.  The  collection  and  transportation  of materials during the recycling process are also optimized  to  achieve  the  greatest  reduction  in  the environmental footprint of the recycled materials.\n\nThe  group  regularly  develops  new  ways  of  reusing materials  from  end-of-life  vehicles,  notably  through collaborative research projects bringing together manufacturers,  local  authorities,  public  players  and universities (see boxed section).",

Together, the three partners seek to establish a secure, sustainable supply source for strategic battery metals such as cobalt, nickel and lithium.\n\nPreviously recovered in a form only suitable for metallurgical applications, these metals will undergo a new closed-loop process to reduce  the  environmental  footprint  of  future  EV  batteries.  The  three  partners  are  already  actively  engaged  in  an  experimental phase, which involves setting up a pre-industrial demo plant in France with the capability of extracting and purifying end-of-life EV battery metals.\n\n## 2) DECORE project (Decarbonization of the Cockpit and Recycling/Reconditioning)\n\nLed  by  equipment  manufacturer  Faurecia  and  with  the  participation  of  Renault  as  a  pioneering  manufacturer  in  the  circular economy, the DECORE consortium focuses on three major areas:\n\n- \u25cf Designing new materials based on recycled and/or bio-sourced materials for the Interior and Seats scope.\n- \u25cf Developing car cockpits made of recycled (or bio-sourced) and recyclable materials.\n- \u25cf Extending the life of vehicles through reconditioning and upgrade solutions.\n\nThis consortium aims to provide:\n\n- \u25ba from 2022, concrete solutions to reduce the carbon footprint and increase the use of recycled and/or bio-sourced materials;\n- \u25ba and  by  2030,  cockpits  designed  with  newly  developed  technologies,  with  a  carbon  impact  of  -85%  compared  with  2019  and incorporating 40% recycled or bio-sourced materials.\n\nSupported by the government as part of the Investing in the Future Program (PIA), this project benefits from the commitment of the public authorities and the control of BPI France's programs to develop technological expertise in France related to carbon neutrality and the circular economy.\n\nThe  other  members  of  the  consortium  are  the  CEA,  a  public  scientific,  technical  and  industrial  research  organization,  and  MTB RECYCLING, an SME recycler and equipment manufacturer since 1981 and an expert in complex waste management.\n\nThe consortium also relies on numerous partners, industry and scientific players (Next move, PFA, Coll\u00e8ge de France, etc.) who will contribute to transforming vehicle seat and interior modules toward a circular economy.\n\n## 3) TCT Project\n\nThe TCT project aims to create a new recycled and recyclable composite material combining technical performance, economy and ease  of  production  in  close  collaboration  with  SAGE,  a  producer  of  automotive  textiles.  It  consists  of  combining  two  recycled materials-automotive scrap and PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles-to produce a textile that will then be thermoformed to produce automobile parts. In addition to the use of recycled materials, this solution offers considerable advantages in terms of weight reduction, recyclability, perceived quality, durability and simplification of the design of automotive parts.\n\nI\n\n02",

This monitoring is primarily based on the analysis of environmental and health publications from the  scientific  community,  official  national  or  international bodies  and  non-governmental  organizations.  It  also  uses collaboration with technology and engineering suppliers to identify and evaluate the technological building blocks that may be integrated into future Group products.\n\n## 2.2.2.3.1. Air quality\n\n2.2.2.3.1.1. Manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Volatile organic compounds (VOC)\n\nEmissions from volatile organic compounds  are monitored, and an action plan to reduce them is in place. This plan involves:\n\n- \u25cf disseminating  the  Group's  best  practices  on  the reduction in the consumption of solvent paint products and the associated emissions, led by the Group's Paint Engineering Department;\n- \u25cf implementing or replacing VOC-processing incineration facilities where necessary.\n\nIn 2021,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  electronic components crisis weighed on the VOC indicator, with a negative  effect  due  to  two  main  causes:  the  nonproportionality  between the drop in production volumes and solvent consumption and the successive shutdowns/ restarts  requiring  the  use  of  solvents  for  cleaning  and purging  installations.  This  deterioration  in  production conditions leads to a 2021 result above the target and at a level similar to 2018. The actions to reduce VOC emissions in the Group's plants during 2021 included:\n\n- \u25cf continued installation of new  VOC  incineration equipment  at  the  sites  in  accordance  with  the roadmap laid out to anticipate changes in regulatory thresholds (new incinerator at Pitesti);\n- \u25cf installation of robotic equipment for certain bodywork paint  and  coating  tasks,  which  enables  much  finer optimization of the quantities of products used;\n- \u25cf introduction  of  indicators  at  certain  sites  to  optimize sealant  and  paint  consumption  and  therefore  reduce emissions at source (deployment to continue in 2022);\n- \u25cf continued deployment of less solvent-based sealants and the reduction of the quantities applied (reduction of anti-grit thicknesses);\n- \u25cf perpetuation  of  actions  undertaken  to  improve  the recovery rate of used solvents at all sites (cleaning and purging solvents).\n\nAt  end-2021,  more than 75% of vehicles produced were painted  with  water-soluble  base  (i.e.  the  solvent  in  the paint mainly consists of water) 1 .",

SO2 emissions  decreased  from  36  metric  tons  in  2010  to 5.5  metric  tons  in  2021.  NOx  emissions  decreased  from 597 metric tons in 2010 to 419.7 metric tons in 2021 1 .  Since fuel  oil  is  now  almost  no  longer  used  at  the  Group's facilities,  the  main  focus  is  now  on  the  modernization  of gas  boilers  and  the  installation  of  low  NOx  emissions burners.\n\n2.2.2.3.1.2. Vehicle use\n\n## Reduction of pollutant emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll vehicles  sold  by  Renault  Group  worldwide  have received appropriate approval from the relevant Authorities in accordance with all applicable regulations.\n\nFollowing  the  widespread  deployment  of  particulate filters  for  diesel  vehicles,  as  imposed  by  the  Euro  5 standard,  the  Euro  6x  standards  lowered  the  authorized particulate emissions levels for all engines while reducing by  more  than  half,  compared  to  Euro  5,  the  authorized limits of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions during laboratory testing  for  the  approval  of  diesel  vehicles  (from  180  to 80  mg/km),  bringing  them  closer  to  those  authorized  for petrol  vehicles  (60  mg/km)  (see  appendix  for  details  of thresholds for the various standards).\n\nSuch a reduction was made possible by the implementation  of  post-treatment  systems  such  as  the NOx trap or SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) technology.  The  NOx  trap  is  a  chemical  system  which traps nitrogen oxides and then converts them into neutral gases. It has been fitted to certain diesel passenger cars sold  by  Renault  Group  in  Europe  since  September  2015. The SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) technology works to  reduce  nitrogen  oxides  into  water  and  nitrogen  by injecting urea.\n\nHowever,  the  identification  of  significant  differences between  emissions  measured  in  real  use  and  in  the laboratory  for  the  approval  has  led  the  European Commission to define a real-use test protocol, introduced with  the  Euro  6d  standard  (RDE,  Real  Driving  Emissions protocol).  Without  waiting  for  these  new  standards, Renault  Group  had,  starting  in  July  2015,  studied  the implementation  of  improvements  on  all  of  its  Euro  6b diesel  production  aiming  at  further  limiting  emissions  in customer use. These improvements were gradually rolled out from August 2016 on the diesel vehicles in this range.\n\nThe roll-out of Euro 6 standards is now an important area of progress in the reduction and management of pollutant emissions  from  internal  combustion  engine  vehicles. These  standards  have  introduced  measurements  under real and variable driving conditions (RDE protocol) of the emissions  of  pollutants  such  as  nitrogen  oxides  or particulates in addition to the measurements made in the laboratory based on a standardized test cycle, which, by nature,  cannot  cover  the  very  wide  variety  of  customer usage:  driving  and  weather  conditions,  driving  style, vehicle load, etc. This is why Renault, for several years, has supported the European approach aiming at implementing measurements under real driving conditions (RDE protocol) in addition to implementing the new WLTP laboratory test procedure, more representative of  average  customer  use  and  the  diversity  of  vehicle equipment than the NEDC cycle.\n\nI\n\n02",

The European  Commission  simultaneously  introduced  the new  laboratory  test  procedure,  WLTP,  which  has  been applicable  since  September  2017  for  new  models  and since September 2018 for all new vehicles.\n\nThe final Euro 6d stage came into force between January 2000  (new  types)  and  January  2021  (all  types)  for passenger  vehicles  (one  year  later  for  commercial vehicles).\n\nIn  order  to  meet  Euro  6d  temp  and  Euro6  d  final standards, the SCR technology, which Renault has used on  its  TRAFIC  and  MASTER  commercial  vehicles  since the  Euro  6b  standards,  has  been  fitted  to  the  entire range of diesel passenger cars sold in Europe. This SCR technology, more constraining in use, with the installation  on  the  vehicle  of  a  urea  tank  to  be  refilled regularly, enables  to  reduce  nitrogen  oxides  with increased  effectiveness  over  an  extended  engine operating range. For  the  final  Euro  6d  stage,  the  diesel emission  treatment  system  has  been  enhanced  with  a second  SCR  to  improve  NOx  treatment  effectiveness over all engine operating ranges.\n\nFor  the  petrol  engines  in  the  range,  the  tri-functional catalysis  system  simultaneously  treats  the  oxidization of  unburnt  hydrocarbons  (HC)  and  carbon  monoxide (CO)  and  the  reduction  of  nitrogen  oxides.  The  various stages  of  Euro  x  standards  have  been  achieved  by improving the engine settings and the load of precious metals  in  catalysts.  From  the  Euro  6d-temp  stage onwards, direct  fuel  injection  engines  have  been  fitted with a particulate filter. As with diesel, this filter allows a drastic reduction in the number of particulates emitted by  vehicles.  With  the  Euro  6d  final  stage,  all  petrol engines have been fitted with a particulate filter.\n\nIn other markets, Renault adapts the technical definitions  of  its  powertrains  to  fit  local  specifics  (fuel quality,  climate,  dust,  etc.)  in  such  a  way  as  to  ensure each vehicle's compliance with applicable regulations in the  country  in  which  it  is  sold.  In  addition  to  strict regulatory compliance, the Group capitalizes on lessons learned  in  Europe  to  fulfill  the  growing  expectations throughout  the  world,  that  pollutant  emissions  during customer use are better taken into account.\n\nInternal  governance  processes  aim  at  analyzing  and controlling  discrepancies  between  the  consumption and  emissions  values  approved  in  the  laboratory  on  a standardized cycle, and  values  measured  during customer use:\n\n- \u25cf systematic measurement, for all models in the range, of  emissions  under  real  driving  conditions  using  the 'RDE'  protocol  (a  'customer'  driving  cycle  has  also been  used  internally  for  many  years  to  evaluate  the consumption  of  our  vehicles  during  use  by  the customer);\n- \u25cf analysis  of  differences  between  the  results  of  these internal  measurements,  other  measurements  of  the same  type  taken  by  third  parties  (government commissions,  NGOs,  specialist  companies  such  as Emissions  Analytics\u00ae  in  particular)  and  the  emission values  approved  in  the  laboratory  on  a  standardized cycle,  and  cross-checking  of  this  information  against feedback gained from customer satisfaction surveys;\n- \u25cf definition  by  the  Group's  Board  of  Management  of strong  guidelines  on  investments  and  developments required  for  the  ongoing  reduction  of  pollutant emissions from internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\n## Contribution of electric vehicles to the improvement of air quality in urban areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElectric  vehicles  form  a  major  strand  of  the  Group's strategy  to  combat  atmospheric  pollution.  Once  they reach a significant proportion of all vehicles on the road, they  will  contribute  to  improving  air  quality  in  urban areas 1 because  they  do  not  generate  emissions  during use.  The  Renault  brand  plans  to  electrify  100%  of  new vehicle models by 2025. The action plan to achieve this ambition is detailed in part 2.2.2.1.2.\n\n## Cabin air quality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir  in  the  cabin  is  a  complex  blend  of  air  drawn  from outside  the  vehicle,  which  supplies  the  heating  and  air conditioning systems, and emissions from materials within the cabin. Renault Group takes these two components into consideration  when  designing  its  vehicles  in  order  to control  their  impact  on  the  quality  of  cabin  air  and  to maintain the health and comfort of passengers.",

Therefore,  as  soon  as  it  designs  its  vehicles,  Renault ensures  that  the  architecture  enables  an  air  treatment system to be fitted. Three types of technical solutions are implemented:\n\n- 1. cabin particle filter (also known as a pollen filter): made of non-woven fibers, it is designed to trap the smallest particles, with an effectiveness of over 85% efficiency from  2.5 \u03bc m  in  diameter  and  95%  for  particles  above 10 \u03bc m;\n- 2. combination cabin filters: there are pollen filters with a layer of activated charcoal grains added. In  addition  to  particles,  the  activated  charcoal  traps gases,  including  aromatic  compounds  and  nitrogen dioxide.  These  filters  are  sized  to  trap  an  average  of more  than  85%  of  these  compounds  on  the  Renault vehicles on which they are fitted;\n- 3. automatic  air  inlet  management  system: this  is  an electronic  system  linked  to  a  toxicity  sensor,  which automatically  closes  the  air  inlet  when  the  sensor identifies  a  peak  concentration  of  certain  pollutants  in the outside air (such as when the vehicle passes through a  tunnel).  In  particular,  it  detects  gases  emitted  by preceding vehicles.\n\nThe  technical  solutions  applied  to  each  vehicle  are  the result of a compromise between a number of requirements (treatment efficiency, defogging, noise and energy  consumption),  and  vary  according  to  range  and equipment level. All passenger cars worldwide sold under the  Renault,  Dacia,  Alpine  and  Renault  Samsung  Motors brands  are  fitted  with  a  cabin  particulate  filter  as standard.  Most  of  the  latest  passenger  car  models marketed  under  the  Renault  brand  in  Europe  come  with combination  filters  as  standard  on  all  versions,  together with  the  automatic  air  inlet  management  system  on higher  trim  levels  fitted  with  automatic  air  conditioning (the  system  cannot  be  offered  on  other  versions  as  it requires power-driven air inlet valves).\n\nHowever,  any  Renault,  Dacia  or  Renault  Samsung  Motors customer whose vehicle is not initially fitted with a technical air  treatment solution from the outset and requiring such a solution  will  be  able  to  obtain  this  equipment  through additional Renault after-sales service.\n\nSustainable development\n\n## Emissions from materials within the cabin\n\nWhen  the  vehicle  is  stationary  and  exposed  to  sunlight, the  presence  of  volatile  chemical  substance  emissions from  materials  in  the  cabin  may  become  overbearing when compared with the quality of the air outside. Renault has  therefore  set  itself  the  objective  of  managing  these emissions in order to minimize their impact on passenger health and comfort.\n\nThus,  since  2009,  all  materials  within  all  internal  vehicle parts  (cabin  and  trunk)  whose  total  weight  within  the vehicle  is  over  100  g  have  been  subject  to  specifications deployed to all relevant suppliers, in an effort to manage emissions  levels  from  the  main  categories  of  volatile organic compounds.\n\nRenault also ensures that any odors caused by the main contributors to the vehicle's atmosphere are limited. This is  assessed  by  a  panel  of  experts  who  are  specifically trained  in  Renault's  own  methods,  based  on  olfactory descriptors and an understanding of odor levels as set out by  the  methods  of  IAP-Sentic \u00ae , a consultancy  firm specializing  in  odors  (and  a  subsidiary  of  the  Burgeap group).\n\n## 2.2.2.3.2. Substance risk management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo safeguard the health of workers and consumers, and to protect ecosystems, legislators have imposed restrictions on the use of hazardous substances in the workplace and in products. In the European Union, the introduction of the Registration,  Evaluation,  Authorization  and  Restriction  of Chemicals (REACH) regulation in 2007 heightened awareness of chemical risks and prompted an increase in the  number  of  restrictions  and  usage  precautions.  Many countries  around  the  world  have  subsequently  followed the European Union with similar regulations, and are also in  the  process  of  legislating  on  other  aspects  related  to heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and biocides, for instance.\n\nRenault has an organization dedicated to the management of dangerous substances, capable of taking into  account  regulations  on  substances  as  well  as proactive anticipation policies. The three divisions devoted to this activity support the roll-out of initiatives in Renault's day-to-day processes:\n\n- \u25cf in  collaboration  with  the  departments  responsible  for occupational health and working conditions, the Industrial Hygiene and Chemical Risks Division manages  workers'  exposure  to  chemical  risks  at  all Renault  production,  engineering  and  logistics  sites around  the  world.  It  monitors  the  chemicals  present  in the formulations delivered to Renault Group and verifies the classification and labeling of the chemical products\n\nI\n\n02",

In  addition,  the  division  coordinates  research  into technical solutions to eliminate priority 'at-risk' substances.  It  provides  an  initial  assessment  of  the chemical risk in accordance  with generic use conditions.  Finally,  it  carries  out  monitoring  work  on chemicals within the environment through the collection of samples and the analysis of the pollutants present  at  workstations.  This  expert  division  was created in the 1960s;\n\n- \u25cf the Materials Engineering Division monitors substances contained in vehicles based on information  declared  by  suppliers  using  the  IMDS (International  Material  Data  System)  system,  shared with 35 international carmakers. It steers the processes  and  developments  of  tools  enabling Renault  to  meet  the  information  and  transparency obligations  required  by  regulations  (in  particular REACH). It steers the search for alternative technical solutions  enabling  the  elimination  of  priority  risk substances by relying on relays within each branch of engineering  (vehicle,  mechanics,  after-sales),  and reinforces  this  approach  with  its  counterparts  both within  and  outside  the  Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance.  It  defines  and  steers  compliance  actions  in the  concerned  entities,  anticipates  default  risks upstream  of  the  supply  chains  and  designs  ways  to transform  regulatory  constraints  into  economic  and competitive opportunities;\n- \u25cf the After-sales Regulatory Compliance Division checks with suppliers that parts, accessories and other products  sold  by  after-sale  teams  comply  with applicable  regulations  and  make  any  substitutions,  if required.\n\nAs  part  of  a  preventive  and  pre-emptive  approach,  since the  1960s,  Renault  has  been  replacing  toxic  substances found  in  the  chemicals  used  at  its  plants  and,  since  the early  2000s,  those  found  in  materials  used.  Renault  has drawn up two lists of substances prioritized for replacement,  for  chemicals  and  materials  respectively, which comprise, in particular, CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic) substances, substances of very high concern and subject to prior authorization (appendix XIV  of  the  REACH  regulations),  as  well  as  substances whose  use  is  not  yet  restricted,  but  which  Renault  would like to see banned at a global level.\n\nThese  two  lists  are  respectively  described  in  two separate  standards:  the  Renault  Group  'Substances' 00-10-050  standard  for  industrial  chemicals  and  RNES 0027, jointly used by Renault and Nissan for automotive components.  These  standards  prohibit  the  use  of hazardous  substances  and  substances  of  concern,  list substances  for  which  substitution  is  a  priority,  and require suppliers to declare the substances used in their parts  and  preparations.  In  calls  for  tenders,  Renault explicitly asks suppliers to comply with these standards.\n\nTheir  application  is  enforced  by  each  of  the  three competent divisions.\n\nIn  line  with  regulations,  Renault  adheres  to  a  policy  of transparency toward its professional and private customers.\n\nIn  addition  to  standard  substances  and  those  with identified  risks,  Renault  pays  close  attention  to  the potential health effects of innovative materials, such as nanomaterials.\n\n## 2.2.2.3.3. Noise\n\n## Manufacturing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoise is a complex subject that involves a wide range of factors  such  as  type  and  power  of  noise  sources  by octave  band,  directivity,  the  impact  of  buildings, topography of locations, weather, etc. For the comfort of residents  living  near  its  production  facilities,  Renault takes  noise  measurements  at  the  property  line  that exceed  regulatory  requirements.  The  group  makes active efforts to limit and reduce noise pollution from its activities  by  working  to  control  'noise'  at  existing  and new facilities, right from the project phases, regardless of  whether  they  are  linked  to  a  new  vehicle  or  a  new building.  The  Group  aims  to  do  this  by  conducting extensive studies on the impact of noise (3D modeling), by selecting high-performance materials with this goal in mind, and by implementing soundproofing measures. These measures are focused on all types of extraction chimneys, boilers, metal drops and logistics-related activities, which generally constitute the main sources of external noise across our industrial sites.\n\n## Vehicle use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll  vehicles  marketed  by  Renault  in  Europe  in  2021 generate a maximum external noise of 72 dBA during 1 , in accordance with Regulation (EU) 540/2014 applicable to vehicles certified since July 2016. The vast majority also comply  with  the  70  dBA  limit  imposed  by  the  second phase of this regulation, applicable to models certified since  July  2020.  The  Group  is  already  preparing  for  the third  phase,  which  will  lower  the  permissible  exterior noise  level  for  most  passenger  cars  to  68  dBA  in  July 2024.  This  includes  work  on  improving  tire  noise emissions,  engine  sound  radiation  and  insulation  and exhaust system attenuation.",

Biodiversity EFPD13\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2019 IPBES 1 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and  Ecosystem  Services  warned  of  an  unprecedented and  increasing  rate  of  species  extinction.  This  report identified and ranked the five direct drivers of change in nature with the largest relative global impacts: (1) changes in land and sea use; (2) direct exploitation of organisms; (3) climate  change;  (4)  pollution;  and  (5)  invasive  alien species.\n\n## Dependencies and impacts analyses\n\nBased  on  the  method  of  a  specialized  consulting  firm, Renault Group conducted an analysis of the dependencies and impacts of its activities on biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nDependencies: Renault  Group  identified  dependencies  of its  activities  on  ecosystem  services  throughout  its  value chain.  The  main  ecosystem  services  needed  for  Renault's\n\nbusiness model are the supply of water, of minerals and of biotic  and  abiotic  energy,  climate  regulation,  water  and waste treatment services and cultural services.\n\nImpacts: Through its own activities, its value chain and the use  of  its  products,  Renault  Group  contributes,  to  a greater  or  lesser  extent,  to  the  five  pressures  on  global biodiversity identified by the IPBES.\n\nIn addition to this first study, in order to better understand the  impact  of  its  own  activities  on  biodiversity  and ecosystems,  the  group  has  set  the  target  of  having  20 preliminary  biodiversity  assessments  conducted  at  its sites  between  2021  and  2023.  These  analyses  will  be entrusted to specialized consulting firms. As of the end of 2021,  10  studies  were  conducted  at  the  sites  with  the greatest  perceived  stakes  (prioritization  of  sites  located near natural sites).\n\nThey  concern  the  Revoz  plant  in  Slovenia,  the  Tangier plant  in  Morocco,  the  Cacia  plant  in  Portugal,  and  seven French  sites, including the Flins, Douai, Ruitz and Maubeuge plants.\n\nThis work highlighted the ecological sensitivities of each site and identified measures to eliminate and reduce the negative effects of the activity.\n\nI\n\n02",

The group is thus committed to avoiding, reducing and offsetting its impacts, aiming for no net loss or a net gain of biodiversity.\n\nIn 2021, Renault Group  prepared  a  positive initial assessment of the progress of its  initiatives  and  stepped up  its  actions  in  favor  of  biodiversity.  These  new  public commitments are S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Additional, Realistic and Time-bound) and are recognized by the act4nature steering committee which is composed of  companies,  business  networks,  environmental  NGOs and scientific bodies.\n\nTo  reduce  the  footprint  of  its  own  operations  on biodiversity,  Renault  Group  applies  specific  protection measures. Industrial projects involving the construction or  extension  of  plants  are  assessed  to  measure  their impact on existing ecosystems. In 2021, a soil survey was conducted at the Douai site in a densely vegetated area, taking  into  account  protected  species.  In  concrete terms,  the  sampling  plan  was  adapted  to  the  species present,  and  the  site  was  monitored  by  an  ecologist  in order to limit damage to biodiversity.\n\nAt  the  Curitiba  site  in  Brazil,  Renault  devotes  37%  of  its space (2.5  million  m 2 )  to  protecting  a  primary  forest  area. This  virgin  forest,  made  up  mainly  of  araucaria  trees,  a species of pine threatened with extinction and protected under  Brazilian  law,  is  home  to  more  than  170  species  of animal.\n\nIn  2021,  regarding  the  industrial  and  tertiary  sites,  the HSEE  Department  produced  guides  containing  actions that  can  be  deployed  at  all  the  sites  to  protect biodiversity.\n\nThey are based on lessons learned from the preliminary biodiversity assessments  conducted  in  2021.  The deployment  of  these  good  practice  guides  with  the environment managers of the sites is underway.\n\n## Renault  Group  also  implements  biodiversity  initiatives outside its own operations:\n\n- \u25cf Since 2019, Renault has been a member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR),  an initiative  aiming  to  improve  the  environmental  and socioeconomic  performance  of  the  natural  rubber sector,  which  notably  includes  actions  to  prevent deforestation.  In  2021,  Renault  contributed  to  the platform's work by co-chairing the working group on traceability.\n- \u25cf Recognising the crucial role that the oceans and their ecosystems play both in regulating the climate and in generating  livelihoods  for  women  and  men, Renault Group joined a group of NGOs, scientists and companies in 2022 calling for a global moratorium on seabed mining , as long as it has not been scientifically proven  that  such  extraction  can  be  done  in  a sustainable manner. (Read more: https:// www.noseabedmining.org/).\n- \u25cf Occasional tree-planting actions. For example, in 2021 in Spain,  Fondation Renault collaborated with the Natural Heritage  of  the  Castilla  y  Le\u00f3n  Region  to  organize  the planting  of  5,000  trees  near  the  Palencia  plant.  The plant's  employees  and  their  families,  i.e.  about  five hundred people, took part in this reforestation based on native  species (holm  oaks,  almond  trees  and  junipers). This  action  will  help  to improve  the  region's  plant biodiversity  and  thus  strengthen  the  existing  animal species . Similarly,  Dacia  in  Romania  organized  the planting of 5,200 trees near the Mioveni site in 2021 with a local  NGO.  Site  employees  participated  in  this  planting operation.\n\nBeyond these specific measures, protecting the biodiversity  of  species  and  ecosystems  also  requires reducing  pollutant  emissions  in  ecosystems  (air,  water, soil:  see  2.2.2.3.1,  2.2.2.4.2  and  2.2.2.4.3),  reducing  pressure on  resources  and  forests,  producing  less  waste  (see 2.2.2.2)  and  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  (see 2.2.2.1). Renault's  continuous  efforts  to  prevent  and mitigate  the  environmental  impact  of  its  activities  and products help to combat ecosystem depletion in this way.\n\n## 2.2.2.4.2. Water consumption and quality EFPD8a EFPD11a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPreserving  water  resources  is  an  ongoing  concern  for Renault, both to ensure long-term supply and to reduce its impact on ecosystems. For this reason, the Group has set  a  goal  of  minimizing  the  impact  of  its  activities  on this  precious  resource  through  the  implementation  of the following five objectives:\n\n- \u25cf reduce water  consumption  at  source  as  well  as  the quantities of wastewater through well-designed processes and optimized management. For example, in vehicle  surface  treatment,  which  is  one  of  the  major causes of water consumption in an automotive plant, the principle  of  reverse-cascade  rinsing  of  baths  and stopping the rinse water flow between each body (which limits  contamination  from  one  bath  to  the  next  by carryover)  enable  a  reduction  at  the  source  of  the quantities  of  water  used  as  well  as  the  waste  to  be treated;\n- \u25cf reuse water where possible for the same use: cooling in a  closed  circuit,  increasing  the  lifespan  of  baths  (to reduce the draining frequency), etc.;\n- \u25cf recycle water  for  other  compatible  uses,  with  or without additional treatment. For example, the Sofasa plant  (Colombia)  recycles  saline  concentrates  from reverse osmosis water to the flushing of toilets and the water  curtains  (air  cleaners)  of  paint  pits,  which facilitates  the  reduction  of  the  quantity  of  water consumed as well as that of waste discharged;\n- \u25cf minimize  the  impact of residual waste  on  the environment  through  efficient  and  strictly  controlled treatment processes;",

Since late  2015,  the  Tangier  plant,  designed  not  to  discharge any  industrial  waste,  has  accordingly  had  a  basin  that enables it to confine any accidental pollution and avoid its discharge into the environment and to treat rainwater drained on the site by decantation.\n\n## Reducing industrial effluents\n\nAmong measures used to meet its objectives  of  reducing water abstraction and the discharge of pollutants into the environment, Renault places a particularly strong emphasis  on  the  recycling  of  industrial  effluents:  the wastewater  generated  by  the  manufacturing  process  is treated  in  a  manner  that  allows  this  same  water  to  be transformed into  a  resource  of  sufficient  quality  to  be  reused in the same process.\n\n- In the powertrain plants,  the  recycling  of  industrial effluents consists in separating the distillate that can then be  reintroduced  into  the  process,  from  the  concentrate (loaded  with  oil)  that  will  be  directed  to  the  appropriate waste treatment channel.\n\nIn  the body assembly plants,  the  recycling  technology  is more complex because the water used in the manufacturing process (surface treatment and electrocoating) must be of very high quality. The treated waste  is  subjected  to  a  reverse  osmosis  process  (a membrane-based  water  demineralization  process),  then an  evapo-concentration  process  (high  concentration  of effluent  through  different  evaporation  stages),  allowing most of the water to be reused in industrial processes and minimizing the quantities of waste generated.\n\nThe Tangier body assembly plant in Morocco is equipped with  the  most  advanced  technologies  available  for recycling  wastewater  from  the  manufacturing  process. Following  the  additional  investments  made  in  2015  to increase  the  volume  of  industrial  effluents  recycled  and thus keep pace with the increase in the site's production rate,  the  volume  of  water  saved  amounted  to  nearly 280,000  m 3 per  year  on  average.  The  Tangier  site  is  the plant with the lowest external water supply ratio (at 1.4 m 3 per  vehicle  produced  in  2020)  in  accordance  with  the target assigned when it was founded.\n\nThe continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crisis on  the  supply  of  parts  (including  electronic  components) are still weighing on the indicator of water consumption per vehicle  produced  because  of  the  sharp  drop  in  volumes that it has caused ('heel' effect on water consumption no longer strictly proportional to production volumes) and also because of unplanned shutdowns associated with certain lockdown periods and/or temporary layoffs, which generated  overconsumption  (e.g.  emptying  of  process baths  that  could  not  be  kept  shut  down,  cleaning/ disinfection  operations  linked  to  prolonged  shutdowns  of certain equipment such as air-cooling towers or hot-water circuits).\n\nThese negative effects have contributed to the continued high  level  of  the  indicator  of  external  water  supply  per vehicle produced.\n\n## Metrics for Renault Group excluding AVTOVAZ\n\n## Distribution of water supplies by source (excluding AVTOVAZ)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope: all manufacturing plants and the main Renault Group tertiary, logistics and engineering sites, excluding establishments in the RRG commercial network (reporting scope described in appendix 2.5.1.3) and excluding AVTOVAZ.\n\nI",

Renault  aims  to  maintain  in-house skills in prevention of soil pollution and remediation.\n\nIn  2021,  the  manufacturing  sites,  as  well  as  the  main engineering,  logistics  and  head  office  sites  of  Renault Group 1 represented  a  total  area  of  3,904  hectares,  of which  49%  are  impervious  areas  such  as  buildings, parking lots, roads and paths. Total surface area and the proportion  of  impervious  surfaces  did  not  change significantly from the previous year, at constant scope.\n\n## Prevention\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  prevention  policy  within industrial  sites is based  on  three  key  tools.  A  risk-rating  grid  is used to assess the level of pollution prevention and  reinforce  it  if  necessary  by  prioritizing required rehabilitation work.\n\nIn the  case  of  new  production  facilities,  the  soil prevention  guide  describes  the  best  techniques  to implement in each type of facility. Both of these tools are in  use  across  all  Renault  industrial  sites  worldwide.  The prevention  policy  ultimately  relies  on  monitoring  of  the quality of groundwater. This monitoring, which is carried out  systematically  when  regulations  so  require  (all\n\nSustainable development\n\nindustrial sites in France), is also carried out voluntarily by Renault when  potential sources of pollution are identified,  to  spot  any  movement  of  pollutants  to sensitive  areas  and  to  take  appropriate  measures  as early as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor several years, all sites in the RRG commercial network (France and Europe) have been equipped with pollution prevention tools, and oil and fuel are now stored above ground or in  double-wall  tanks f itted  with  alarms  and retention tanks.\n\n## Remediation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  management  of  past  subsoil  pollution hinges  on  a  risk  assessment  based  on  the source-vector-target  concept  and  aims  to ensure  the  suitability  of  the  subsoil  for  the planned or identified uses.\n\nThere  are  several  stages  to  the  pollution  management system:\n\n- \u25cf a historic and documentary study, including an analysis of the site's vulnerability, was conducted for operational industrial sites, former industrial sites converted to other uses and the RRG commercial network.

This  is  why  Renault  Group's  environmental  policy  (see 2.2.1.1)  aims  to  reconcile  product  and  service  offerings with environmental protection, to deploy environmental management throughout the Group, eliminate or reduce environmental  impacts  and  organize  environmental communication.  All  of  these  provisions  are  subject  to annual monitoring, carried out jointly by the signatories of  the  framework  agreement, based on indicators (see section 2.3.2.4).\n\nThe vigilance plan linked to supplier and subcontractor activities is covered in chapter 2.4.2, 'Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain'.\n\n## 2.2.3.1. Risk mapping  DV1a   DV2a\n\nAs  regards  to  obligations  under  the  Duty  of  Vigilance, Renault  Group  has  identified  the  main  environmental risk factors that may impact the ecosystems or exposed persons  that  are  a  potential  result  of  the  Group's activities or the activities of its suppliers and subcontractors.  Among  these  macro  risk  factors, particular attention is paid to:\n\n- \u25cf the use of water resources (see 2.2.2.4.2);\n- \u25cf pollutant  discharges  into  water  and  the  natural environment (see section 2.2.4.2);\n- \u25cf the generation of waste and its management in ad hoc infrastructures,  in  particular  hazardous  waste  (see section 2.2.2.2);\n- \u25cf the pollution of soil and groundwater (see 2.2.4.3);\n- \u25cf air  pollution  linked  to  the  use  of  chemicals  or  processes that generate atmospheric pollutants (see section 2.2.2.3);\n- \u25cf climate change (see 2.2.2.1).\n\nThe  Group  decided  to  include  climate  change  in  its Vigilance  plan  although  the  topic  differs  from  those listed in the law.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  risks  are  prioritized  according  to local  characteristics  (groundwater  sensitivity,  water stress zones, processes with high use of chemicals, etc.), and  regulations  are  put  in  place  by  local  authorities (ICPE, SEVESO, etc.).\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nWith regard to manufacturing activities, which potentially generate  the  greatest  environmental  risks,  analyses  are carried out through the '\u00c9corisques' computerized expert system,  whose  approach  is  both  qualitative  (sensitivity, organization,  training  and  chemical,  toxicological  and ecological  approach)  and  quantitative  (noise,  natural resources, waste,  emissions,  wastewater,  chemicals). The \u00c9corisques system makes it possible to evaluate and prioritize  risks  and  potential  impacts  generated  by  the site's  activities  in  the  context  of  a  lifecycle  and  the implementation of corrective measures to minimize those risks.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  carried  out  through  \u00c9corisques  is  an integral  part  of  the  ISO  14001-certified  Environmental Management  System  (EMS)  implemented  at  each industrial site (see 2.2.1.4.5). Since the end of 2021, this risk mapping  has  been  reinforced  by  the  deployment  of  a new  internal  tool,  'Mandatory  Rules  Environments', explained  in more  detail  in the 'Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Environment' chapter (see 2.3.2.1).\n\n## Other activities\n\nFor  engineering  and  testing,  logistics,  and  spare  parts storage  activities,  the  largest  centers  managing  these activities  perform  risk  mappings  similar  to  the  one described above through the Environmental Management System.\n\nAs regards the sales and after-sales activities controlled by the Group, risk analyses are performed in the major countries under the Site Management System, some of which are ISO 14001-certified.\n\nIn  the  same way as for Manufacturing, the existing risk mappings  will  be  reinforced  by  the  deployment  of 'Mandatory Rules Environments', which will be in effect at  all  the  sites  in  the  engineering,  logistics,  sales  and after-sales scope by the end of 2023.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate  change  linked  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  is understood  both  locally  (exposure  of  sites  to  extreme climate  phenomena)  and  globally.  The  Group  has analyzed its challenges, particularly the implications of the  COP  21  Paris  agreement  for  the  automotive  sector, and translated  the  risks  and  opportunities  so  they  can be  taken  into  account  in  the  Company's  strategy  and product and services offering (see 2.2.2.1.4).",

Actions to prevent risks and serious harm  DV3a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nAs  far  as  manufacturing  activities  are  concerned,  plants have, through their Environmental Management System, an organizational structure to prevent risks and environmental damage.  Every  year,  action  plans  are  put  in  place  to continuously  improve  environmental  performance  and reduce  risks.  Obtaining  ISO  14001  certification  from  an independent third party validates the effectiveness, pertinence and adequacy of the Environmental Management System (see 2.2.1.4.5).\n\n## Other activities\n\nThe largest centers that manage engineering, testing and logistics activities have the same organizational structure as  the  industrial  sites.  At  the  other  sites,  this  structure  is not fully deployed given the lower level of environmental risk.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe physical risks associated with extreme weather events, the frequency and intensity of which are likely to change as a result  of  the  global  rise  in  temperature,  are  taken  into account in the same way as other natural and industrial risks as  part  of  the  Group's  prevention  policy  (see  'Climate  risk and opportunity management' in section 2.2.2.1.4).\n\nIn  line  with  the  targets  set  according  to  the  COP  21  Paris Agreement,  Renault  Group  is  also  implementing  a strategy  to  reduce  its  carbon  footprint  throughout  the lifecycle of its products by, in particular, reducing the CO2 emissions  from  ICE  engines,  deploying  electric  vehicles and  their  ecosystem  (second  life  and  smart  battery charging),  deploying  new  mobility  services,  developing circular  economy  activities  and  improving  the  energy efficiency  of  its  industrial  facility  and  logistics  on  an ongoing  basis  (see  complete  list  of  actions  and  tools  in section 2.2.2.1.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.3.3. System for monitoring the measures implemented and assessing their effectiveness  DV5a\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nFor manufacturing activities, several levels of control over the implementation and effectiveness of the action plan have been established:\n\nSustainable development\n\n- \u25cf an  initial  level  of  internal  control  at  each  site  is  carried out within the context of the Environmental Management System;\n- \u25cf a  second  level  of  control  is  performed  through  internal Environmental Management System audits by teams of two  to  four  Renault  auditors  from  other  sites.  These audits  cover  the  requirements  of  ISO  14001  on  various environmental  topics  (soil,  water,  air,  waste,  energy, chemicals,  legionella  risk,  noise  and  risk  prevention). Upon  receipt  of  the  Audit  Report,  the  audited  entity defines  the  action  plan  to  address  each  point  of  noncompliance.  The  completion  and  effectiveness  of  the action plan are verified during the next annual audit;\n- \u25cf a third level of control and monitoring of the implemented  measures  is  performed  through  an external  annual  audit  carried  out  by  an  independent accredited  body  as  part  of  obtaining  ISO  14001 certification;\n- \u25cf finally,  the  environmental  data  for  each  site  (quantities of waste, wastewater and atmospheric emissions, water and  energy  consumption)  are  reported  via  a  Group system. These data are audited and validated annually by another independent audit body.\n\n## Other activities\n\nAs regards to engineering and testing activities, sales and after-sales  activities  in  Europe  and  South  Korea,  spare parts  storage  facilities,  the  largest  centers  managing these activities have the same organizational structure as the industrial sites.\n\n## Climate change\n\nA global carbon footprint reduction indicator throughout the  whole  vehicle  lifecycle  enables  to  manage  action plans  and  provides  a  concise  overview  of  the  Group's contribution  to  the  decarbonization  of  the  automotive sector.  The  progress  of  the  various  action  plans  which support this carbon footprint reduction target is measured  by  quantified  performance  indicators.  The carbon  footprint  indicator  covers  Renault  Group's  own performance  and  also  those  of  its  suppliers,  particularly production and logistics activities.\n\nThe  CO2  emissions  of  vehicles  during  the  use  phase account for a significant portion of the carbon footprint, so reducing these is high on the Company's priorities. They are  therefore  regularly  monitored  at  the  Group  Board  of Management  level  (position with regard to CAFx regulations).\n\nAction plans, results and associated indicators are shown in  chapter  2.2.2,  'Priority  areas  for  action:  actions  and indicators', (sections 1 to 4) and chapter 2.2.1.4 (environmental  objectives  table:  internal  audits  and ISO 14001 certifications).\n\nI\n\n02",

Carmakers  alone  cannot redefine  and  shape  tomorrow's  mobility.  This  is  why Renault  Group  works  closely  with  various  players  who also take on the subject: local and regional authorities, start-ups, companies, universities, etc.\n\nObjective: to offer solutions tailored to each individual's needs\n\n## 2.3.1.1. A 'Made in Renault' and ecosystem innovation for sustainable mobility EFPD14a\n\nRenault Group has been committed to the development of large-scale electric mobility for more than 10 years. A pioneer  in  Europe,  it  announced  the  launch  of  a complete  range  of  four  affordable  100%  electric vehicles  in  2009.  Promise  kept  from  2011.  Since  then,  it has  been  renewing  and  expanding  its  offering  with electrified  models  whether  hybrids,  plug-in  hybrids  or 100%  electric.  By  2022,  all  new  models  will  have  an electric or electrified version.\n\nThe group's objective is simple: to make electric mobility accessible to all by meeting everyone's needs.\n\nElectric  mobility  is  the  best  immediately  available response  to  accelerate  the  energy  transition,  fight against climate change and improve air quality in cities.\n\nRenault  Group,  which  has  been  marketing  a  range  of electric  vehicles  since  the  end  of  2012,  has  acquired  a valuable lead over newcomers to the market, particularly in terms of sales and after-sales issues.\n\n## A. Today, more than 96,000 Renault electric vehicles are sold in Europe\n\nIn  2021,  in  the  European  electric  vehicle  market,  the Renault  brand  sold  more  than  96,000  electric  vehicles. ZOE  remains  the  best-selling  electric  car  in  Europe overall  since  2012  with  354,006  units  sold  by  the  end  of December  2021.  The  E-TECH  range  (EVs  and  hybrid engines)  will  account  for  30%  of  Renault's  passenger vehicle sales in Europe in 2021 (vs. 17% in 2020).\n\nLaunched  in  spring  2021,  Dacia  SPRING,  Dacia's  first electric  vehicle,  brought  in  more  than  47,000  orders  in Europe, and 27,876 Spring units were sold as of the end of December 2021.\n\nUnveiled at the IAA in Munich in September 2021, the new Megane  E-TECH  Electric  is  designed  on  the  Alliance's CMF-EV platform. Natively and exclusively designed for 100 %  electric  vehicles,  this  new  platform  pushes  the limits  of  modularity.  The  new  Megane  E-TECH  Electric offers  up  to  470  km  of  range  according  to  the  WLTP standard and can be driven 500 km with only 30 minutes of downtime.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  enhancements,  Megane  E-TECH Electric  offers  great  driving  pleasure  thanks  to  its  low center of gravity and ideal weight distribution, a very low steering  ratio  allowing  quick  vehicle  response  and  a multi-link rear suspension.\n\nMegane  E-TECH  Electric  is  produced  in  Douai  on  the CMF-EV  platform.  This  platform  will  represent  700,000 units at the Alliance level by 2025.\n\nRevealed when the Renaulution Plan was announced in January 2021, Renault 5 Prototype heralds the production vehicle  to  be  launched  in  2024.  The  production  vehicle will  be  based on the unprecedented CMF-BEV platform and  will  enable  Renault  Group  to  offer  affordable electric vehicles.\n\nFor  Renault  Group,  the  electric  vision  goes  far  beyond the  car,  which  is  why  it  created  a  fourth  brand  in January 2021: Mobilize .\n\nMobilize's  ambition,  through  a  very  comprehensive integrated  offering,  is  to  contribute  to  a  sustainable world by providing mobility services as well as services related to energy and data .",

Knowing how to deal with these three  subjects  means  optimizing  technological  solutions and therefore costs... toward zero carbon.\n\nWith Mobilize, Renault Group is positioning itself in the new world  of  mobility  and  is  committed  to  achieving  carbon neutrality in Europe by 2040.\n\n## Examples of Mobilize's contributions:\n\nIn the field of mobility ,  Mobilize encourages the transition from ownership to use.\n\n- \u25cf Car-sharing, developed with 'Zity by Mobilize' (today in Paris/the  Paris  region  and  Madrid),  allows  people  to borrow  an  electric  vehicle  whenever  they  want  and  to drop  it  off  at  any  public  parking  space  in  the  area covered by the service when they no longer need it.\n\nThe 'Mobility 360'  project, created with Uber, RATP and BlaBlaCar, brings together experts who intend to use their complementary expertise and coordinate their approach to  propose  simpler,  greener,  sustainable  and  shared mobility solutions for cities and citizens.\n\n- \u25cf In the field of energy , the ambition is to make the electric vehicle part of everyday life.\n\nAn  electric  vehicle  can  be  charged  intelligently  when electricity  is  cheapest  and  least  carbon-intensive,  and  it can also become an energy source. This is the 'vehicle-togrid' (V2G) system.\n\nThe energy stored in the car's battery is fed back to the grid when there is a surplus. For example, a vehicle could supply energy to the city grid when the need for electricity is greater than the supply and eventually supply the house with energy.\n\nMobilize also develops innovative solutions to extend the life of electric vehicle batteries.\n\nMobilize has entered into an agreement with Betteries, a German start-up with a strong commitment to the circular economy,  to  develop  and  assemble  a  mobile,  modular, multi-use  energy  system  consisting  of  battery  modules from electric vehicles. Easily transportable, this system is made up of one to four elements (betterPacks) of 2.3 kWh and  can  thus  reach  a  capacity  of  9.2  kWh,  equivalent  to the  average  consumption  of  a  household  over  a  day.  It offers  the  advantage  of  being  zero-emission  and  silent and  points  to  the  energy  transition  from  transportable electric generators to clean and mobile electric systems.\n\nThere  are  multiple  uses  and  applications  of  this  system when connection to the electricity grid is impossible, such\n\nas  construction  sites,  food  trucks,  solar  energy  storage, filming  and  events.  The  manufacture  of  this  innovative storage system will begin in 2022 at the Flins Re-Factory.\n\nThis plant is where Mobilize is primarily developing energy storage  solutions  with  the  Advanced  Battery  Storage project. It is the largest stationary energy storage device. Ultimately, the project is set to reach a capacity of 70 MWh across France and Germany.\n\nAfter the plant in Douai (North of France) and Elverlingsen (Germany),  Mobilize  has  chosen  to  install  480  unused Renault Zoe batteries at the Re-Factory in Flins (Yvelines, France) for an additional capacity of 15 MWh.\n\nThe Group has also formed a partnership with Compagnie Seine Alliance and the integrator GreenVision to electrify a fleet of boats on the Seine using second-life batteries of Renault electric vehicles.\n\nAs  a  pioneer  in  the  development  of  'Smart  Islands', Mobilize  innovates  to  provide  territories  with  a  range  of solutions and achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nAfter Belle-Ile-en-Mer (France) and Porto Santo (Portugal), the aim now is to convert the Brazilian island of Fernando de  Noronha  into  a  'smart  island'.  With  electric  cars, charging stations powered by solar panels, and a way for excess  energy  to  be  sent  back  to  the  grid,  Mobilize  has implemented an energy management system designed to preserve nature and help the local community.\n\n## B. Innovation developed through our strategic partnerships\n\nThe  automotive  industry  is  undergoing  fundamental changes.  Customers  are  moving  away  from  owning  a vehicle  to  using  mobility  services.  Territories  are  taking the  initiative  to  develop  new  modes  of  mobility  that  are environmentally friendly, efficient and inclusive. Vehicles are increasingly electrified, which creates new needs and constraints  for  their  users.  With  the  creation  of  the Mobilize  brand,  Renault  Group  is  fully  committed  to supporting these changes, with the ambition of simplifying the lives of users of mobility services and being a leading partner for the territories.\n\nAccording  to  the  UN,  in  2050,  the  global  population  will reach  9.8  billion  people,  with  almost  70%  living  in  urban areas  compared with 55% today, representing 2.5  billion additional city dwellers. This forecast gives an indication of the immense challenges to be faced in terms of quality of  life,  inclusion,  urbanization,  housing,  transport  and healthcare in cities, as well as accessibility to these new forms of mobility outside of cities.\n\nIn  terms  of  mobility,  new  uses  and  new  technologies  are spreading, questioning the place and status of individual cars ownership. The market  is increasingly being structured  according  to  uses  of  consumers,  who  are looking  less  for  ownership  of  a  vehicle,  than  for  a multimodal, innovative, connected, more  ecological offering suited to the diversity of their needs.\n\nI",

Vehicles that are  clean,  silent  and  shared  will  travel  through  it. Personal vehicles will share the road in the cities, as well as  in  rural  areas,  with  new  forms  of  services  based  on usage:  carsharing,  carpooling,  on-demand  vehicles (private-hire  vehicles,  taxis,  etc.)  as  well  as  robot vehicles.\n\nToday in Europe, several car-sharing services operated by Group partners use Renault electric vehicles. Renault Group  is  the  leader  in  electric  car-sharing  in  Europe. More  than  12,000  electric  vehicles  are  available  to carsharing users in most European capitals as well as in sparsely populated suburban and rural areas. The Group adapts its offering to the context and offers both freefloating and closed-loop solutions.\n\nThe car is  already  electric  and  connected:  tomorrow  it could  also  be  autonomous,  with  the  benefits  of smoother,  more  fluid  traffic  and  improved  safety.  The development  of  autonomous  cars  and  shuttles  will accelerate  the  growth  of  electric,  autonomous  and shared mobility services. They will promote complementarity between modes of transport, multimodality  and  make  the  overall  system  cleaner, safer, more  accessible,  more  effective  and  more efficient.\n\nSince  2017,  Renault  Group  has  been  working  with  both public and private partners to experiment with Renault ZOE Cab prototypes for on-demand, electric, autonomous, and shared mobility services. The objective  of  these  programs  is  to  learn  the  needs  of users  and  territories  within  an  ecosystem  of  mobility services. They are part of France's national SAM project (Safety  and  Acceptability  of  Autonomous  Driving  and Mobility)  responding  to  the  EVRA  (Experimentation  of Autonomous  Road  Vehicles)  call  for  projects  from  the ADEME  (French  Agency  for  Ecological  Transition)  in connection  with  the  Investing  in  the  Future  (PIA) program.\n\nFollowing the lessons learned during the first phase, led by  the  Research  Department,  tests  run  at  the  Rouen Normandy Autonomous Lab and Paris-Saclay Autonomous Lab are now set to enter a second phase with  a  broader  range  of  experimental  opportunities  to test new ways of using vehicles. They will use optimized Renault ZOE Cabs for this purpose. 2020 saw the start of this  second phase with technical drives to successfully increase the speed to 50 and then 70 km/h. Tests open to the public will begin in 2022.\n\nIn  June  2019,  Renault  Group,  Nissan  Motor  Co.  and Waymo  signed  an  exclusive  agreement  for  an  initial phase of exploration covering all aspects of autonomous  mobility  services  for  the  transport  of people and the delivery of  goods  in  France  and  Japan. This  agreement  brings  together  the  strengths  of  the three partners and extends their expertise through the assessment of market opportunities and joint research on  commercial,  legal  and  regulatory  issues  related  to mobility service offers in France and Japan.\n\nAlliance  Ventures,  Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi  Motors Corporation's investment fund created in January 2018, has  also  invested  in  Transit,  a  multimodal  application (MaaS) that enables users to choose  the  most appropriate mobility mode for a trip, and Coord (end of our  participation  in  November  2021),  which  facilitates the analysis, sharing and collection of data on 'curbs', in order  to  offer  partners  and  cities  solutions  to  better manage the various mobility services.\n\nIn France, in addition to its internal carpooling platform for  employees, Renault Group joined forces with Klaxit , the  leading  carpooling  app  for  commuters.  Since  2014, Technocentre employees have been able to share their journeys  directly  using  the  app.  This  makes  it  easy  for them  to  find  new  carpoolers  and  save  money  on  their daily  commute.  More  generally,  Renault  is  working  to improve the carpooling experience by studying interface  solutions  between  carpooling  operators,  its connected vehicles and digital tools.\n\n## C. An innovation designed with public players\n\nThe  city  of  tomorrow  will  be  innovative  and  adaptable while being respectful of the environment. The growth of the urban population comes with countless challenges: developing  urban  mobility  while  limiting  pollution, providing solutions to climate change and for society's ecological  transition,  optimizing  water  and  energy management,  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  people, contributing to social cohesion, designing, building and renovating buildings and neighborhoods.\n\nRenault  Group  contributes  to  collective  thinking  on sustainable mobility systems in cities and particularly on mobility ecosystems.\n\nLed  by  the  Research  Department  in  cooperation  with greater  Rouen,  the  EV4all  project  aims  to  offer  a package  of  solutions  (existing  and/or  innovative)  to decarbonize the everyday mobility of modest households living in rural areas.\n\nThe  detailed  analysis  of  these  populations  led  to  the conclusion that a small electric vehicle, equipped with a 20kWh battery, would cover their daily needs, especially since rural housing allows easy access to an electrical outlet.\n\nBeyond  technical  sizing  limited  to  what  is  strictly necessary,  the  challenge  is  also  to  devise  financial solutions for access to these vehicles without any initial contribution  by  proving  their  economic  interest  for  the households concerned and for the 'operator'.  Various schemes  involving  greater  Rouen,  employers  and  the combination  of  new  and  second-hand  vehicles  are being evaluated. The goal is to build attractive proposals before  the  forthcoming  widespread  implementation  of low-emission zones (ZFE) in French cities.\n\nRenault  Group  also  sponsors  a  number  of  academic chairs that fuel this thinking, such as the Urban Logistics Chair  with  Mines  ParisTech,  which  since  2016  has  been focused on inventing innovative and sustainable urban logistics models.\n\nRenault  freely  shares  its  expertise  in  this  area  via numerous thematic round-tables and seminars.",

It  is  supported  by  the NextMove  and  several  local  authorities (Yvelines Departmental  Council  and  the  Versailles  Grand  Parc and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines city authorities).\n\nVeDeCom  is  an  institute  for  shared  and  co-located research  into  electric,  autonomous  and  connected vehicles and the mobility ecosystem built on infrastructures  and  services  addressing  new  uses  for shared mobility and energy.\n\nVeDeCom  has  more  than  50  members  from  different industry  and  service  sectors  (automotive,  aeronautics, systems  engineering,  electronic  components,  ITC  and numerical  simulation,  infrastructure  management  and transport  operators,  digital  networks  and  energy  grid operators), from several research and higher education institutions, and from local authorities, all of whom have agreed  to  collaborate  on  pre-competitive  and  prenormative research topics.\n\nSuch research involves a multidisciplinary effort bringing together physicists and chemists, mechanical, electrical and electronics engineers, computer scientists, as well as sociologists,  psychologists,  economists  and  lawyers  to study the impacts and acceptability of these new types of use in order to promote  suitable  ergonomic  and regulatory frameworks.\n\nSince  2014,  Renault's  contribution  to  the  Institute's activities consisted of more than \u20ac13 million in funding, including the ongoing provision of several experts.\n\nIn the coming years, VeDeCom should continue to play a major  role  in  the  French  sustainable  mobility  research ecosystem  with continued support from Renault through an annual investment of around \u20ac1.7 million.\n\n## 2.3.1.2. Innovation and commitment to road safety\n\nAs  announced  at  the  Annual  General  Meeting  in  April 2021, road safety has become one of the three pillars of our  new  sustainable  development  strategy  and  feeds into Renault Group's long-term commitment  to responsible mobility.\n\nReducing  the  number  of  accidents  and  casualties  on Europe's roads and prioritising the safety of road users are among our commitments.",

Because the causes of accidents and injuries in these new regions  differ  from  the  traditional  European  market, Renault Group is expanding its accident research beyond Europe,  transferring  its  own  know-how  and  gaining expertise from local laboratories and universities as well as other key players in road safety.\n\nIn order to fully assume its responsibilities, Renault Group has made a two-fold commitment:\n\n- \u25cf through its products. Based on an analysis of observed risks, it incorporates solutions and innovations into all its\n\nRenault  Group's  road  safety  policy  and  actions  are  based  on  three  main  focuses  (prevent,  protect,  rescue)  and  two secondary focuses (raise awareness, correct) that allow us to take action before, during and after an accident:\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRESCUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRAISE AWARENESS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCORRECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PREVENT\n\nPrevention involves helping drivers to anticipate risks. Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits  beyond  which  they  will  be  incapable  of  controlling  their  vehicles,  and  the  situations  in  which  they  are  putting themselves at risk.\n\n## PROTECT\n\nA top priority of Renault Group's road safety strategy is to protect the car's occupants according to the nature and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault thus equips both the front and rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) is also taken into account.\n\n## ASSIST\n\nRenault Group collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimize help for accident casualties. These services  receive  guides  and  attend  information  sessions  explaining  how  to  perform  rescue  operations  on  each  new Renault vehicle. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practice victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand's vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.\n\n## RAISE AWARENESS\n\nChanging  the  behavior  of  stakeholders  (employees,  public  authorities,  emergency  services)  over  the  long  term  is  the challenge in the battle to improve road safety.\n\n## CORRECT\n\nThe quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver.\n\nI\n\ndesign,  manufacturing  and  marketing  processes  in order to protect vehicle occupants and others exposed to road risks (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.);\n\n- \u25cf in society.

A new Renault Group policy for road safety  EFPD16a\n\nRenault  Group  is  committed  to  safer  mobility,  both  for the  occupants  of  its  vehicles  and  for  all  road  users (pedestrians,  cyclists,  etc.).  Renault  Group  relies  on  the research  of  the  LAB  (laboratory  for  accident  research and  biomechanics)  to  constantly  and  concretely improve the safety of its products and services. For more than  50  years,  the  LAB  has  provided  world-renowned scientific expertise to observe, analyze and anticipate.\n\nFounded in 1969 as an EIG (economic interest grouping) by  the  two  French  manufacturers  PSA  SA  and  Renault Group, the LAB is the laboratory for accident research, biomechanics and human behavior studies.\n\nIts  strength  is  based  on  varied,  complementary  skills  in the service of safety: engineers, data scientists, biomechanics experts, physicians, cognitive ergonomics experts and field accident investigators.\n\nIn  2021,  the  LAB's  experts  participated  in  a  European collaborative  project,  Horizon  2021,  piloting  a  European industrial  project,  and  in  two  projects  of  the  French interministerial delegation for road safety (DISR).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PREVENT with the Renault Safety Coach\n\nPREVENT\n\nFirst detect: Following the model of the eco-score already introduced in our range, the new Renault vehicles will offer a  Safety  Score  to  analyze  driving  habits  and  provide driving advice adapted to each individual. The principle is simple:  based  on  the  data  from  the  vehicle's  sensors, simple driving criteria are developed in order to establish a driving score from the point of view of safety and behavior. Soon to be offered on our new vehicles, the safety score will have  the  advantage  of  enabling  drivers  to  identify  areas for  improvement  to  help  them  adopt  a  more  preventive driving style and thus act to reduce driving risks and, as a result,  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  road  accident research.\n\nThen  guide:  in  real  time,  data  from  the  vehicle's  sensors and connected systems will alert and advise the driver by signaling  surrounding  or  upcoming  risks  on  the  on-board screens (dashboard and multimedia screen). The navigation will also indicate areas that are statistically more accident-prone in order to encourage more careful driving around these high-risk areas. All of these features, grouped  together  in  the  safety  coach,  are  designed  to advise the driver for safer driving.\n\nUnder  certain  conditions,  we  will  also  take  action  on speed, which accounts for more than one third of fatal accidents. Safe Guardian  adapts  the  vehicle  to anticipate and prevent hazards.\n\nAll new models approved starting in mid-2022 (passenger vehicles and small commercial vehicles) will have the following as standard equipment:\n\n- \u25cf an  AEB  (Advanced  Emergency  Braking)  system  to reduce the risk of a rear-end collision;\n- \u25cf an  Emergency  Lane  Keeping  system  to  alert  and correct for unintentional lane departure;\n- \u25cf an Intelligent Speed Assist system to alert the driver if the legal speed limit is exceeded;\n- \u25cf a  Driver  Drowsiness  &  Attention  Warning  system  to detect decreased alertness and warn the driver based on an analysis of actions,\n- \u25cf a  Reversing Detection system to detect the presence of an object in the rear field of the vehicle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PROTECT with the LAB's expertise\n\nPROTECT\n\nSince 1969,  PSA  and  Renault  Group  have  been  advancing road  safety  with  the  LAB.  It  is  a  major  contributor  of scientific  publications  in  its  field.  It  has  made  major advances in road safety - knowledge of human behavior and tolerance levels of all sorts of people (age, size, gender, position,  etc.)  -  and  is  helping  manufacturers  to  design future technologies to increase safety for road users.\n\n## Thanks to the LAB, Renault has:\n\n- \u25cf Reinforced  front  impact  structures  and  integrated  pretensioning systems that have made it possible to lower shoulder  belt  tension  and  improve  the  complementary relationship  between  the  belt  and  airbags  to  reduce injury risks. Plastic parts that may be in contact with the occupant have been designed to limit the applied forces.\n- \u25cf Reinforced side impact structures and integrated side airbags  protecting  the  chest  and  head.  Plastic  parts that  may  be  in  contact  with  the  occupant  have  been designed to limit the applied forces.\n- \u25cf Enhanced  seat  and  headrest  behavior  to  prevent whiplash in a rear impact.\n- \u25cf Improved  child  protection  with  Isofix  attachments  to properly position dedicated child seats.\n- \u25cf Modified the design of the front of vehicles to improve pedestrian protection.",

The challenge is therefore to save time and facilitate the work of rescue teams in the event of an accident.\n\nFormalizing  a  long-standing  relationship  with  the  fire brigade  (2010),  Renault  Group  works  regularly  at  the national  level  with  the  Directorate  of  Civil  Security  and Crisis Management  (DGSCGC)  and  with  the  French National  Federation  of  Fire  Fighters  (FNSPF).  As  the  only manufacturer  to  be  a  member  of  the  World  Rescue Organisation  (WRO)  and  working  hand  in  hand  with  the fire brigade in 12 European countries to better understand their  needs  and  facilitate  their  work  in  the  field,  Renault Group has built  a  unique  collaboration.  It  can  be  seen  in the donation of several hundred overhauled vehicles per year dedicated to road rescue training and the creation of the position of a lieutenant-colonel of firefighters integrated  within  our  staff  to  support  the  project  teams and to provide dedicated training to fellow firefighters.\n\nFireman  Access makes  it  easier  for  firefighters  to  deal with  battery  fires  in  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid  vehicles. The battery fire is extinguished after five minutes instead of  nearly  two  hours. Fireman Access is  a  part  placed  on the  chassis  of  an  electric  vehicle  that,  in  the  event  of  a malicious  vehicle  fire,  allows  the  jet  from  the  fireman's hose  to  access  the  400-volt  battery  underneath,  which itself is equipped with fireman access next to the chassis fireman access. The aim is to drown the battery by filling it with water, which is the only way to turn off a lithium-ion battery quickly and permanently.\n\n## Renault Group is currently the only carmaker to offer this technical solution to firefighters.\n\nThe traction battery disconnection  system (HT) is positioned  directly  on  the  battery  in  order  to  guarantee complete electrical safety for all those involved, including the emergency services.\n\nThe Rescue Code on  the  windscreen and rear window of our  vehicles  allows  firefighters  to  immediately  identify  a vehicle  involved  in  an  impact  thanks  to  a  QR  code  that gives  access  to  the  rescue  sheet  providing  useful information  on  the  architecture  and  systems  that  can impact  them  in  their  efforts.  In  the  event  of  a  serious accident, this speeds up passenger assistance by nearly 15  minutes  and  increases  the  chances  of  survival  of victims by 50%.\n\nSustainable development\n\n## Closer look at actions in 2021 :\n\n- \u25cf implementation  of  design  studies  to  ensure  the  best position  for  the  service  plug  and  fireman  access  on future electric and hybrid vehicles in the Renault range. Emergency  service  needs  are  taken  into  account  from the  design  stage  of  vehicles.  For  example,  fireman access  is  already  integrated  into  all  our  electric  and plug-in  hybrid  vehicles:  ZOE,  ZOE  Long  Range,  KANGOO Z.E  Long  Range  and  MASTER  Z.E,  TWINGO  Electric, MEGANE  Electric  and  Spring  Electric,  CAPTUR  plug-in hybrid and MEGANE plug-in hybrid;\n- \u25cf monitoring and ensuring that the Engineering Department takes into account the first rules of design relating  to  emergency  firefighter  interventions  on  our hybrid and electric vehicles\n- \u25cf systematic verification of the appropriate performance of our electric and hybrid vehicles in the event of fire;\n- \u25cf participation in video conferences to share our knowledge  on  alternative  energy  vehicles  with  the rescue community;\n- \u25cf active participation in the Euro NCAP's consideration of firefighter  interventions  following  accidents  in  order  to define the protocol for 2023;\n- \u25cf donation of more than 450 latest-generation vehicles to the  firefighter  services  of  France  and  Europe  in  2021  to help improve their road rescue training.\n\n## All vehicles comply with the regulations in force in Europe and outside Europe.\n\n## Europe:\n\n- \u25cf All  new  passenger  car  models  are  equipped  with  six airbags,  seatbelt  pretension/restraint  in  front  seats/ central  rear  seats  and  at  least  two  Isofix  cables  in  the rear. There are also seatbelt reminders for every seat in the 1 st and 2 nd rows.\n- \u25cf Already in  place  on  our  fully  electric  and  plug-in  hybrid vehicles, Fireman Access will continue to be deployed on all future  electric  and  electrified  models  to  allow firefighters  to  extinguish  a  burning  EV  as  quickly  as  an ICE vehicle (the only OEM to allow this performance).\n- \u25cf Rescue Sheet: technical guide for rescue teams; Renault was  the  first  manufacturer  to  adopt  the  standardized format for these documents in 2014.\n\n## Outside Europe:\n\n- \u25cf The deployment of standard passive safety elements is underway in line with the renewal of local range plans.\n- \u25cf In  terms  of  active  safety,  in  addition  to  passive  safety devices,  we  intend  to  deploy  and  adapt  systems  that have already been tried and tested and are recognized for  their  effectiveness,  such  as  emergency  braking assistance,  overspeed  warning  and  lane  departure warning.\n\nI\n\n02",

Specifically,  it  has  updated  and  widely  circulated  the Renault Group Driver Charter, which is focused on three main areas: 'I plan my journeys', 'I adhere scrupulously to all  good  driving  rules',  and  'I  am  a  responsible  driver'. Since 2018, this Driver Charter has been the foundation for an e-learning module  for the Group's employees worldwide.  It  aims  to  support  and  empower  employees during  their  business  travel  and  commuting,  and  on  the job.\n\nIn 2021, a partnership was established in France with the 'En Voiture Simone' website to give all employees and their  families  a  simple  way  to  review  the  rules  of  the road.\n\n## Prevent, correct, protect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPREVENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPROTECTCORRECT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group played an active part in road safety for more than 50 years, long before it became the familiar media topic we know today.\n\nThis  commitment  to  automotive  safety  has  been substantiated  by  the  attainment,  24  times  over,  of  the maximum 5-star rating in Euro NCAP tests, having been the  first  carmaker  to  do  so  in  2001  on  the  D  segment (Laguna II in 2001), then on the C-segment (Megane II in 2002)  and  lastly  on  the  B-segment  (Modus  in  2004). This cross-disciplinary approach has been enriched by taking into account new  issues related to the compatibility  of  vehicles  in  frontal  impact  and  the phenomenon  known  as  submarining,  which  is  now taken into account in certain new NCAP protocols.\n\nThe in-depth knowledge  of accident and injury mechanisms  developed  through  LAB  research  has furnished Renault Group  with  an  ambitious  and pertinent  vision  of  the  steps  needed  to  improve  road safety.\n\nThis  effort  in  the  field  of  passive  safety  will  therefore continue  over  the  coming  years,  particularly  supporting the  tightening  of  rules  for  consumer  testing  around  the world.\n\nWhile efforts in passive safety undertaken by the entire automotive industry have enabled extremely significant\n\nimprovements to be achieved in terms of reducing the road death toll, recent technological advances, complementing public policy, have heralded a new and very  promising  area  of  progress,  meaning  that  it  is  no longer  a  case  of  limiting  the  consequences  of  an accident, but rather, of reducing their severity, or even, avoiding them altogether.\n\nThis is where primary road safety comes into play, with ADAS (Advanced  Driver  Assistance  Systems).  These ADAS can  alert  the  driver  to  danger,  assist  with corrective maneuvers  or  brake  when  collision  is imminent, supporting the driver if he or she has failed to react.  These  systems,  the  most  typical  today  being Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), will be able to act on one of the recognized causes of accidents to reduce their  occurrence  and  severity:  the  driver's  delayed reaction due to a lack of attention or anticipation.\n\n## Renault's  ambition  is  to  improve  the  safety  of  all  its vehicles through driver assistance systems.\n\nIn  2015,  ESPACE was the first in its range to feature these new  functions,  which  are  already  to  be  found  in  other C and D-segment vehicles: KADJAR, TALISMAN, MEGANE IV and KOLEOS. The preparation of new systems is underway, benefiting from the very rapid progress in the development of sensors and onboard electronics. In 2016, SCENIC unveiled a new generation of even more powerful ADAS  systems,  including  Automatic  Emergency  Braking with  pedestrian  detection.  This  will  feature  in  the  vast majority  of  our  future  products,  including  less-premium ranges over the coming months. This equipment has been improved with the renewal of the segment B CLIO/CAPTUR launched in 2019, which obtained 5 stars in the Euro NCAP ratings, with the latest-generation ADAS enabling CLIO to be voted best car in its category.\n\nRenault Group makes a total of 13,150 educational videos (17 languages and 22 countries) presenting the functionalities  and  technologies  of  Dacia  and  Alpine brand vehicles, including ADAS, available to customers. This total includes the 5,900 online ADAS tutorial videos (Renault and Dacia BUs), i.e. around 45%.\n\nThe  website  https://www.e-guide.renault.com/portail/ has received 3.5 million visits since 2017 and the tutorials, available  in  17  languages  and  22  countries,  have  been seen nearly 17 million times.\n\n## 2.3.1.2.2. Integrating new technologies\n\nThe  vehicle  of  the  future  will  be  zero  emission, communicative  and  driverless.  The  communicating vehicle is connected to other vehicles, to the road and to the  environment.  The  vehicles  exchange  information about their location, speed, planned route, etc. They will also act as sensors for other vehicles, indicating traffic, road issues,  etc.  The  information  obtained  will  be  used first  and  foremost  to  provide  safety  services  (incident warnings for onward route, roads or areas with specific hazards,  etc.)  as  well  as  traffic  services  (congestion, alternative real-time itineraries, etc.).",

Renault  Group  is  therefore  working  in-house with  VeDeCom,  the  scientific  community  and  industrial partners, as well as with public authorities, on all aspects of safety:\n\n- \u25cf operational safety;\n- \u25cf general product safety;\n- \u25cf regulatory compliance (technical and Highway code);\n- \u25cf compliance  with  the  European  Statement  of  Principles on Human-Machine Interface;\n- \u25cf development of international norms and standards;\n- \u25cf definition  of  possible  applications  for  connectivity  and automation services compatible with planned or foreseeable usage, including any potential distractions;\n- \u25cf compliance with the laws on personal data records.\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate this safety through six types of testing, to test and validate the performance and safety of the services and associated technical solutions:\n\n- \u25cf basic operational tests using test facilities and simulations;\n- \u25cf operational tests on test tracks;\n- \u25cf operational tests on open roads with escort vehicles;\n- \u25cf service tests on authorized open roads;\n- \u25cf 'large-scale' service tests on authorized open roads;\n- \u25cf pre-marketing pilot tests.\n\nThe connected vehicle has already been rolled out as part of the collaborative SCOOP@F project.\n\nPartially  automated  vehicles  with  simple  initial  cases  of use have taken their place in the Renault range.\n\nRenault Group is fully involved in the French collaborative program SAM for Safety and Acceptability of Autonomous Driving and Mobility, which brings together a consortium of  industrial  and  research  players  and  regional  partners. This program is in response to the EVRA (Experimentation of Autonomous Road Vehicles) call for projects launched by the ADEME (French Agency for Ecological Transition) in connection with the Investing in the Future (PIA) program in June 2018. The three-year project began in July 2019. This program enables autonomous vehicle experiments to be carried out and contributes to the creation of a common asset for capitalizing on the driving scenarios necessary for their validation.\n\n## 2.3.1.2.3. General product safety\n\nIn  terms  of  general  product  safety,  Renault  Group  has defined a general policy to be followed based on:\n\n- \u25cf a  reference  database  of  customer  events  considered potentially  safety-related.  These  events  are  addressed systematically  during  visits  to  dealerships  or  with  recall campaigns.    This  reference  database  is  updated regularly  by  a  structure  with  general  product  safety\n\nrepresentatives  in  each  of  the  large  entities  involved  in product safety, under the authority of an Expert Leader ;\n\n- \u25cf the  creation  of  safety  documentation  for  each  project (demonstration  of  safety  risk  control  documentation), covering  engineering,  manufacture,  sales  and  aftersales.  It  is  created  and  validated  according  to  specific rules and processes and signed by the Chief Engineer of the relevant project and by the Renault Expert Leader in product operational safety and overall safety;\n- \u25cf the establishment and introduction of training/ awareness-raising sessions for relevant Renault employees.\n\n## 2.3.1.3. Making mobility as widely accessible as possible\n\n## 2.3.1.3.1. Affordability and physical accessibility\n\n## Widely accessible spare parts\n\nWith regard to service, Renault Group developed a more affordable  range  of  spare  parts  to  make  mobility accessible to the greatest number of people.\n\nStarting  in  1998,  Renault  offered  a  full  range  of  parts equivalent  in  terms  of  safety  and  functionality  to  the original vehicle parts, whatever the brand. Since then, the offering  has  evolved  to  better  meet  the  expectations  of customers  and  markets.    Renault  offers  an  alternative service  for  its  models  over  five  years  old  in  its  network under  the  VALUE+  brand.  This  offering,  exclusively dedicated  to  Renault  and  Dacia  vehicles,  is  the  best alternative to the original part with all carmaker services and warranties.  As  for  the  Motrio  brand,  it  is  adapted  to the needs of all makes of vehicles over four years old and currently  has  8,500  references  divided  into  70  different product families.\n\nThis range is compatible with 50 automotive brands and more than 500 vehicle models.\n\nCurrently,  Motrio  is  present  in  around  50  countries worldwide  and  the  brand  even  has  its  own  multi-brand garage chain. Building on this success, Motrio is naturally continuing  its  international  growth,  and  has  committed itself  to  the  crucial  digital  and  e-commerce  channels  for closer contact with its customers.\n\nFor  many  years,  Renault  has  also  been  developing alternatives  to  new  parts.  In  2012,  Renault  created  an after-sales refurbished parts service. In anticipation of the requirements of the Royal law on the use of parts from the circular economy in automotive repairs (which came into force  in  2017),  Renault's  sales  network  offers  used  body parts (hoods, fenders, headlamp units, etc.) in France and mechanical parts in France that have been collected and selected  in  Indra's  approved  network  of  ELV  (end-of-life vehicle)  centers.  This  service  is  particularly  of  interest  to customers whose vehicles are not economically repairable using only new parts.\n\nI\n\n02",

This new business area is a major development area for the standard exchange service. The refurbishment  of  electronic  parts  has  been  a  natural addition to the refurbishment activities and is in line with both technological developments and customer needs. The used parts are collected in the distribution network, sorted and refurbished according to a rigorous industrial process. These renovated ('standard exchange') parts are sold to Renault vehicle owners at a lower price than new parts while satisfying the same quality requirements\n\n(see paragraph 2.2.2.3).\n\nRenault pays particular attention to adapting its spare parts  pricing  to  the  change  in  the  residual  value  of  its vehicles  in  order  to  optimize  their  reparability.  Renault initially  focused  its  efforts  on  the  bodywork  segment. The cost of repair is an essential criterion for insurers to avoid premature scrapping. Thus, between three and six years after the date of launch, depending on the range, Renault concentrates its price reduction efforts on parts related to passive safety (airbags, seatbelts, dashboard, etc.).  Likewise,  from  the  cessation  of  marketing  of vehicles,  the  price  of  bodywork  parts  (bumpers,  doors, wings, etc.) and glazing is adjusted each year. Renault is going  further  by  adopting  the  same  approach  for mechanical parts. The ambition is the same: to promote repairs by fully integrating the residual value of vehicles into the pricing of parts.\n\n## Renault Tech: mobility solutions for everyone\n\nCreated in 2009, Renault Tech is a business unit with the mission of  designing,  producing  and  marketing  vehicle conversions and offering associated services in response to the needs of businesses and individuals in keeping  with  Renault  Group's  quality  standards.  The entity is delegated  by  Renault  Group's  program departments to manage the development and industrialization  of  new  passenger  cars  and  light commercial  vehicles.  For  more  than  10  years,  Renault Tech  has  made  people  with  reduced  mobility  a  core focus of its concerns, offering them a complete range of adaptations to Renault and Dacia vehicles and enabling them  to  travel  in  complete  autonomy  and  safety whether for business or pleasure.\n\nThrough  Renault  Tech,  Renault  Group  is  the  only European manufacturer engaged in the design, manufacture  and  marketing  of  vehicles  dedicated  to the transport of people with reduced mobility.\n\nRenault  Tech  adaptations  include  vehicle  adaptations to transport wheelchairs (access ramps, internal fittings),  swivel  or  exit  seats  to  assist  with  wheelchair transfers  and  driving  aids  (accelerator/brake  hand control,  steering  balls,  multi-function  remote  controls, etc.).  This  offer  is  available  in  the  whole  of  the  French\n\ndistribution  network,  and  internationally  via  Renault subsidiaries.\n\nEach year, more than 1,000 adapted vehicles leave the plant  at  Heudebouville  in  Normandy  and  the  Renault Tech site located in the Renault plant at Sandouville.\n\nFor almost 20 years, Renault has had a partnership with F\u00e9d\u00e9ration  Fran\u00e7aise  Handisport  (the  French  Disability Sports Federation), to which it provides financial support and adapted vehicles.\n\nwww.renault.fr/vehicules/mobilite-reduite.html\n\nIn  addition  to  this  activity  dedicated  to  people  with reduced  mobility,  Renault  Tech  engineering  is  also developing  a  range  of  conversions  and  customized industrial fittings for company fleets.\n\n## 2.3.1.3.2. A committed, socially responsible player\n\nAlthough  mobility  is  a  key  element  for  the  social  and professional  inclusion  of  people,  millions  of  them nevertheless  remain  limited  every  day  in  their  travel. Penalized by financial, geographical and social hindrances, too many people have to give up a job or a training  course  quite  simply  because  they  cannot  get there. In France, among individuals living in a household earning less than \u20ac1,000 per month, 54% report that they had given up a job because they had no means to travel (source:  'Mobility  and  access  to  employment'  survey, January 18, 2017).\n\nAs  a  major  player  in  mobility,  Renault  Group  therefore decided to act for more  inclusive and socially responsible  mobility  by  setting  up  a  social  business program  that  aims  to  favor  the  mobility  of  the  most vulnerable.\n\nAccording  to  the  impact  survey  conducted  in  2021, thanks  to  the  products  and  services  offered  by  the companies supported by Caremakers Invest:\n\n- \u25cf more  than  52,000  people,  including  more  than 27,000 people in vulnerable situations, have had better access to mobility;\n- \u25cf more than 7,000 people in a fragile financial situation were able to find or keep their jobs.\n\n## 1. Develop  specific  offers  intended  for  people  in uncertain situations\n\nThis concerns the development, with a viable entrepreneurial approach, of projects that have meaning for the employees of the Group, its customers and  its  partners,  maximizing  the  social  impact  rather than the profit.\n\n## Caremakers:  an  inclusive  mobility  solution  through  a micro-loan offering\n\nIn  France,  the  Caremakers  Inclusive  Mobility  offerings enable  economically  vulnerable  people  to  access  or remain in the job market by providing new vehicles and after-sales services (repair and maintenance) at special prices.",

On the strength of the satisfaction rate of this program and the initial very positive results of its impact  on  the  improvement  of  the  professional situation of its beneficiaries, Renault Group is committed to developing these offers in France and in other countries and is aiming for 4,000 LOAs in 2025, a tenfold increase in volumes in five years.\n\n## 2. Financial investment in social businesses\n\nIn  October  2018,  the  group  decided  to  create  a  Social Business  Strategic  Area  of  Expertise  (SAE)  under  the Sustainable  Development  Department  with  a  view  to embedding social business into the Company's strategy for the  long  term  alongside  other  traditional  core  business areas. This Social Business SAE complements the other SAEs of  Renault  Group  and  fosters  a  new  perception  of  the Company's  activities.  It  enables  employees  seeking  more meaningful  work-related  initiatives  and  wanting  to  bring about change to get involved.\n\nCaremakers  Invest  S.A.S.  has  been  offering  funding  and support since 2012 to innovative entrepreneurs developing mobility  solutions  for  people  in  difficulty.  Renault  Group contributed \u20ac5 million to this company's capital. Caremakers Invest is a certified Solidarity and Social Utility Enterprise  company  (ESUS).  The  capital  provided  by Renault  is  increased  by  contributions  from  the  employee savings  funds  through  the Renault  Caremakers  Solid'air employee  mutual  fund . In 2021,  this  fund  shifted  its investment  to  strengthen  the  solidarity  impact  and  focus on inclusive  mobility  solutions.  This  fund  grew  by  5.02%  in 2020 and by 5.40%  as of  the end of 2021.\n\nThe Management and Investment Committee (CDI) is the central governance body of Caremakers Invest S.A.S. and is  newly chaired by Philippe Buros, Senior Vice President, Sales and Marketing. The CDI is composed of 12 members, including  an  employee  representative  and  an  outside specialist in investment and social business.\n\nIn nine  years,  Caremakers  Invest  S.A.S.  has  already provided  funding  (capital  or  debt)  for  16  projects, appointing Renault employees as mentors. The details of the supported companies can be found online at https:// rse.groupe.renault.com/investissementsolidaire.\n\nThe  companies  supported  by  Caremakers  Invest  are asked  to  measure  the  social  impact  of  their  respective activities. A common framework of nine result and activity indicators,  put  together  with  HEC,  was  deployed  in  2018. All companies are participating in the scheme in this way:\n\n- \u25cf France Active Investissement is an investment company that  finances  the  social  and  solidarity  economy  in France.  With  its  40  territorial  associations  and  its network of economic and social players, France Active supports  entrepreneurs  who  wish  to  invest  in  a  project with  a  positive  impact  in  order  to  create  an  activity  by committing themselves to a territory.\n- \u25cf Responsage innovates in the social support of employees  on  very  concrete  issues  such  as  housing, budgeting, health, disability or help for elderly relatives. A lack of mobility can aggravate already fragile situations. Responsage  has  thus  become  a  prescriber  for  the 'Garages  Renault  solidaires'  and  seeks  to  strengthen synergies with Renault Group.\n\n## 3. Participate in the influence and development of social business within the Company and outside\n\nRenault Group is a co-founding member of the Movement for  Social  Business  Impact,  which  aims  to  promote  the inclusive economy by supporting research and teaching, and by developing concrete projects having an impact on the reduction of poverty.\n\n## A Social Business SAE (strategic area of expertise)\n\nIn  October  2018,  the  Group  decided  to  create  a  Social Business  Strategic  Area  of  Expertise  (SAE)  under  the Sustainable  Development  Department  with  a  view  to embedding social  business  into  the  Company's  strategy for the long term alongside other traditional core business areas.  This  Social  Business  SAE  complements  the  other SAEs of Renault Group and fosters a new perception of the Company's activities. It enables employees seeking more meaningful work-related initiatives and wanting to bring about change to get involved.\n\n## Training in inclusive business\n\nIn 2018 and 2020, training sessions were organized to enable around 20 employees per session to familiarize themselves with  societal  challenges,  identify  corporate  responsibility and  the  tools  available  to  them  to  take  concrete  action  in favor of a more sustainable world. As these training courses are increasingly in demand by many employees, the format will be extended and offered to international employees. Since the end of 2021, these courses have been included in the Renault training catalogue.\n\n## Flins inclusive campus:\n\nLaunched at the end of 2020, the Flins Re-Factory project will have  a  training  campus  for  circular  economy professions designed to meet the skills needs of Renault and,  more  broadly,  of  all  companies  developing  circular economy activities. Renault Group, an inclusive company, is committed to making the campus accessible to people with  reduced  mobility  or  with  disabilities,  to  promoting gender parity in its recruitment, and to opening up training to  migrants  from  the  labor  pool,  who  will  be  trained  in French  as  a  foreign  language  (FLE)  and  business  skills,\n\nI",

Health, safety, ergonomics and environment (HSEE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Duty of Vigilance\n\nAs  part  of  its  duty  of  vigilance 1 , Renault  Group  has established and implements a vigilance plan.\n\nRenault  Group,  together  with  its  stakeholders,  defined measures  for  reasonable  vigilance  covering  health  and safety  of  persons  in  its  Global  Framework  Agreement  of July 2, 2013. This is based on nine general principles of risk prevention.\n\n## Creation of a Health, Safety, Ergonomics and Environment Division (DHSEE)\n\nAs  part  of  the  Renault  Group  commitment  to  health  and safety,  a  dedicated  department  reporting  directly  to  the Executive Committee was set up in September 2016.\n\n## DHSEE Vision and Policy\n\nRenault Group is preparing for ISO 45001 accreditation i.e. the implementation of a health and safety management system,  based  on  the  requirements  of  the  ISO  standard and  in  coherence  with  the  health  and  safety  part  of  the environmental  and  Social  Governance.  The  objective  is the  reduction  of  occupational  injuries  and  diseases, including physical and mental health. As a 1 st process step, Renault Group has officialized its Health and Safety policy, signed by the Group's CEO and the Group HR VP.\n\nA  dedicated  team  has  been  appointed  to  work  on  the ISO45001 project and is currently building the foundations of  the  Health and Safety Management System, supported by a competent/recognized organism.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.1. Risk mapping  EFPD3a   DV1a\n\nDHSEE is engaged in an intense worldwide risk evaluation activity  by  visiting  sites  and  performing  wall  to  wall inspections with the aim of identifying key areas of risk.\n\nOn the back of this activity DHSEE developed and launched Safety 10 Mandatory Rules (10 MR) with 74 supporting Key Requirements in 2017. The rules capture a wide range of topics including: 5S (focusing on establishing and  sustaining  order,  tidiness  and  cleanliness),  work  on installations  (Lock  Out  Tag  Out),  managing  access  to dangerous  parts  of  machinery,  traffic  management  (safe site, safe vehicle, safe driver), storage and handling of heavy\n\nloads, chemical management, working at height, management of subcontractors, fire prevention, ergonomics and many other topics.\n\nAlthough  all  activities  were  severely  impacted  by  the 2  last  year  constraints  linked  to  the  pandemic,  a  total  of 317 10MR safety audits were performed to date.\n\nManufacturing  sites  have  developed  in  house  10MR  safety Dojos  (=  safety  schools)  as  part  of  their  information, instruction and training induction programs.\n\nIn  2019,  the  DHSEE  developed  Mandatory  Rules  and  Key Requirements  to  support  the  other  domains  of  HSEE  : Health, Ergonomics, Environment, Human Fire Safety and Projects.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.2. Procedures for regular assessments  ECD3a   DV2a\n\n## A. Field assessments\n\nThe  DHSEE  performs  Mandatory  Rules  audits  and coaching  on  each  of  the  HSEE  domains  as  described above  but  sites  can  also  benefit  from  DHSEE  specific expertise  (machinery,  traffic,  ergonomics,  \u2026)  in  case  of special requests, launch of a new project, introduction of new technology\u2026\n\nPriority  was  once  more  given  to  protect  personnel  from exposure  to  the  coronavirus  in  2021,  however  30  official 10MR  safety  audits  were  performed  this  year  of  which  6 were in the manufacturing scope.\n\nNevertheless,  DHSEE  continually  helps  the  sites  to  develop self-assessment  capabilities  and  as  such  sites  continue  to self-check. Each and every site has performed at least one safety 10 MR self-assessment in 2021.\n\n## B. Statistical assessment to complement field assessment\n\nAn intense pareto analysis of historical incidents stemming 10  years  was  performed.  This  analysis  together  with findings in the field led us to focus on Access to Dangerous parts of Machinery, Work at Height, Contractors, Slips, Trips and Falls and Ergonomics.\n\nA  dedicated  part  of  the  team,  working  upstream  on projects  is  part  of  the  data  analysis  process.  They  work closely  with  the  field  experts  and  the  data  analysts  to identify  areas  in  serial  life  that  through  redesign  could have eliminated residual hazards.\n\nThis  continuous  analysis  pinpoints  the  effect  of  the strategy and of the Mandatory Rules deployment.\n\nI\n\n02",

Appropriate risk mitigation actions  DV3a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA brief overview of some of the key areas we are working on is presented below.\n\n## A. Project Management\n\n- 1. The  HSEE  project  team  has  now  developed  the mandatory rules and key requirements for projects.\n- 2. The  rules  have  been  integrated  in  the  company quality management system.\n- 3. Metiers  are  established  and  training  is  underway  to ensure  everybody  is  aware  of  the  rules  and  key requirements.\n- 4. We publish a gazette every 2 months to communicate progress  inside  project  management  along  with other materials.\n\n## B. AVTOVAZ\n\nThe DHSEE appointed a dedicated manager to support AVTOVAZ. In 2018 seven (7) members of the DHSEE team visited AVTOVAZ to work in collaboration with the local team  and  establish  a  baseline  reference  point  from which  improvement  initiatives  were  defined  and  a dynamic  PDCA  created.  Since  then,  DHSEE  and  other specialists have undertaken 14 weeks of Gemba visits to conduct coaching and audits.\n\nAmong the topics are:\n\n- \u25cf reporting and analysis of accidents;\n- \u25cf 10 mandatory rules and 74 criteria deployment;\n- \u25cf safety DOJO implementation;\n- \u25cf machinery improvements (LOTO, guards, RFID switches, etc.);\n- \u25cf fire risk assessment (plastic injection plant);\n- \u25cf forklift upgrade and floor marking;\n- \u25cf integration of HSE in projects.\n\nThanks  to  a  new  efficient  team  on  site  and  strong support  of  Management,  the  results  are  visible  on  the Gemba and safety performances are improving.\n\n## C. Fire safety\n\nHSEE  Division  and  the  Risk  Prevention  Division  have implemented a new fire permit in all Renault Group entities from  July  2021.  The  primary  objective  being  to  intensify associated  risk  assessments.  Feedback  on  this  new procedure  has  been  positive  and  the  number  of  fires related  to  hot-spot  works  is  relatively  low  since  then.  The reliable  fire  tracking  procedure  deployed  mid-2020  will enable to ensure the efficiency of the new fire permit.\n\nHSEE is currently working on specific human fire safety (focus  on  Burns  and  asphyxiation)  mandatory  rules inspired by the success of the 10 Safety Mandatory Rules\n\nusing  identical  compliance  roadmaps  inclusive  of ranking according to tried and tested criteria.\n\n## D. Contractor management\n\nRenault  is  building  a  single  unified  Contractor  Safety Management platform which will enable us to manage the  entire  contractor  safety  lifecycle  which  covers  six key elements.\n\n- 1. Make Renault Business Managers more comfortable in writing their Prevention Plans with the Contractors, and not forgetting any information that could ensure as  much  as  possible  the  most  comprehensive  risk assessment  and  preventive  measures  which  will  be implemented  on  work  sites,  including  co-activities due to other woks ongoing near to the site works.\n- 2. Streamline  and  standardize  the  pre-qualification processes to ensure contractors are properly vetted for EHS risks.\n- 3. Ensure  contractors  have  been  properly  trained, competent and onboarded before they arrive on site, and that all needed authorizations are given and up to date (administrative, technical, \u2026).\n- 4. Conduct  pre-job  Task  and  Risk  Assessments  and establish  task-hazard  controls  to  minimize  and mitigate risks.\n- 5. Monitor  and  supervise  work,  flag  EHS  issues  that need to be corrected, and evaluate contractors, EHS performance  to  identify  high-risk  contractors  when future contract work is needed.\n- 6. Establish  a  complete  overview  of  all  ongoing  works by means of a site map, allowing a better view of coactivities (it will be implemented beginning of 2022).\n\nThe contractor management platform is in the Production phase, ready to be used since November 2021\n\nAll  HSE  French  site  managers  and  their  teams  (except RRG) have been trained during 3 days as administrators (52  people  in  October  /  mid-November  2021).  They  now are  beginning  to  provide  training  sessions  for  all Business  Managers  owning  to  their  sites  (at  least  2414 Business Managers) : end of these training sessions on end of March 2022.\n\n## E. Machinery and Equipment\n\nAll  Manufacturing sites have recorded interventions by providing videos demonstrating how Lock Out Tag Out procedures  are  performed.  The  sharing  of  visual evidence  has  enabled  coaching  and  feedback  to  the sites for best practice for ensuring how the safe isolation of machinery is achieved.\n\nRegarding machinery safety, tools and procedures have been  developed  to  mitigate  machinery  related  risks which, just to mention a few, essential safety requirements  for  suppliers,  inspection  check-sheets, safe machinery interactions and risk assessment.",

Included  in  this  update,  is  the aspects relevant to machinery safety rules number 2 and 3 of the 10 Mandatory Rules for site safety.\n\nDuring  this year's activities, safety inspections  for machinery in serial life has also been considered with the development of an inspection tool that can be applied to all types of machinery to identify potential safety hazards. This  allows  the  relevant  teams  to  pro-actively  identify hazards and discuss suitable control measures to be put into  place.  To  date  some  3100  have  been  carried  out.  To enable an open discussion platform, the Machinery Safety Club  was  created  in  2020.  The  new  installation  process tool  and  the  safety  inspection  procedure  have  been communicated through this club which, to date has seen over  90  people  attend.  Training  on  these  new  tools  has been provided to over 170 people.\n\n## F. Electric and hybrid vehicles\n\nElectric  and hybrid vehicles are one of the pillar projects for the company in Renaulution plan.\n\nThe  HSEE  dimension  has  been  strengthened  in  electric and hybrid vehicle projects from the product and process design stage in order to make the work of plant operators and after-sales technicians safer. All the players involved in these projects have been trained.\n\nSafety is integrated upstream in the design of the product by  standard  solutions  like  safe  design  of  high  voltage batteries,  by  electric  lockout  tagout  procedure  for  safe assembly and maintenance on each vehicle.\n\nSafety training program has been upgraded during 2020 with  support  of  French  certified  organization  APAVE (Association  des  Propri\u00e9taires  d'Appareils  \u00e0  Vapeur  et Electriques).  The  theorical  part  of  the  new  training program was supplemented by several practical exercises.  The  new  training  session  integrates  more practices with a specific Dojo (safety school) focused on the  characterization  of  hazards  and  the  implementation of safety rules.\n\nThe  new  training  program  is  already  implemented  in several major sites (Douai, Maubeuge, Cl\u00e9on, Pitesti \u2026). The deployment continued in 2021 in all our sites through our Manufacturing Academy and Renault Academy.\n\nIn  the  scope  of  transportation  and  concerning  the  EV battery,  guidelines  and  training  sessions  on  regulatory requirements  for  suitable  packaging,  test  of  battery before transportation, were implemented by the internal Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor.\n\n## G. Traffic Management\n\nIn  2021,  HSEE  division,  still  in  collaboration  with  impacted functions,  are  keeping  on  improving  the  tools  and\n\nstandards  developed  earlier  ;    among  others  :  traffic memorandum (Reference Guide), risk assessment method (Safe Site, Safe Vehicle, Safe Driver), other standards \u2026\n\nSites  have  kept  on  working  on  the  deployment  of  those tools this year.\n\nECG  is  the  Association  of  European  Vehicle  Logistics aiming  at  reducing  the  number  of  accidents  when delivering  cars  through  cross-industry  working  groups. The  association  provides  a  platform  for  the  finished vehicle logistics sector in Europe. Renault is an important player and is in the sub-groups set up to work specifically on topics such as accident analysis, Safe Loading Process, and Safe Yards.\n\n## H. Ergonomics  EFPD3a\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Ergonomics  department  supported  19 vehicle  projects  with  a  focus  on  inherent  ergonomics design.\n\nIn  parallel  the  new  ergonomic  management  system, which consists of three pillars (Ergonomics memorandum, Ergonomics evaluation method and Ergonomics Mandatory rules), has been defined for all industrials sites and engineering.\n\n## 1. Ergonomics memorandum\n\nThe Ergonomic memorandum is a reference guide which encompasses standard ergonomic principles, adapted to all fields of activity.\n\nFour  specific  ergonomics  memorandum  have  been finalized  and  deployed  :  Bodyshop,  Paintshop,  Stamping and Logistic.\n\n## 2. Ergonomics evaluation method\n\nThe workstation ergonomics assessment is now deployed in  all  industrial  sites.  The  aim  is  to  perform  intense  risk assessments,  in  order  to  define  action  plans  to  reduce Number of Days lost and musculoskeletal disorders.\n\nAlready 4018 Supervisors have been trained by ergonomists  in  plant  and  6465  workstations  have  been assessed by Supervisors.\n\n## 3. Ergonomics Mandatory Rules\n\nThe  key  criteria's  and  experience  gathered  from  all previous works have been consolidated into 6 Mandatory Rules.\n\nAll  these specifications will be used upstream in projects to  eliminate  the  introduction  of  ergonomic  constraints whilst  simultaneously  applied  in  serial  life  to  identify opportunities to enhance working conditions.\n\nThis will allow to identify new opportunities in serial life to improve working conditions and reduced number of Days Lost linked to ergonomic constraints.\n\nI\n\n02",

Training\n\nAwareness and competence of employees is one of the key  drivers  of  the  HSEE  global  strategy.  To  increase employees HSEE awareness and ensure the necessary competences, a specific and extensive training program is  defined.  The  HSEE  training  program  approach  is mainly divided into 3 main different levels:\n\n1 st level: HSE Basics, which includes trainings such as: SWI (Safety  Workstation  Induction)  training,  Virtual  reality hazard  hunt,  new  comers  induction,  HSEE  mandatory rules  general  introduction,  safety  dojo  and  accidents management.\n\n2 nd level:  Baseline  qualifications,  which  include  mainly external  trainings  performed  by  recognized  training organisms  such  as:  NEBOSH  International  General Certificate,  CMSE\u00ae  -  Certified  Machinery  Safety  Expert (CMSE),  ISO  45001  occupational  health  and  safety standard, Fire Safety -Methodology for fire investigation causes (CNPP).\n\n3 rd level:  Thematic  /  or  technical  training,  which  covers specific  HSEE topics such as LOTO (Lock-Out Tag-Out), Electricity  vehicles,  machinery  safety,  chemical  safety, ergonomics tools, among others.\n\nAdditional to the trainings managed at corporate level, sites  are  also  strongly  engaged  in  a  training  process according to the specific needs they have.\n\nVideo  simulations  of  the  most  serious  accidents  have been  created  and  shared  worldwide  for  awareness raising. Since 2019, 12 simulations have been created and viewed  by  more  than  8,200  individual  viewers  from inside  the  company.  Feedback  about  this  type  of communication is very positive, as the simulations show the basic sequence of events leading to the accident.\n\nDuring the accident analysis, as soon as the appropriate risk  control  measures  have  been  identified,  they  are summarized  and  shared  via  a  dedicated  Transversal Memo which is also shared worldwide. 22 of them have been communicated on the last 2 years.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.4. Device for monitoring HSEE measures and their effectiveness EFPD3a   EFPD3b   DV5a\n\n## Digitalization\n\nThe  DHSEE  is  becoming  mature  on  digitalization.  With applications managing occupational incidents reporting, alerting and root cause analysis, chemicals management, ergonomics and environment assessment, contractor  management and the 1 st step  of  deployment of a legal watch and compliance application tool, Renault Group is starting to cover efficiently all aspects of HSEE. Those  tools  are  or  will  cover  the  entire  Renault  Group business scope.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Workplace accidents  EFPD3b\n\nOn the back of the success of the FR1 reduction we have decided to switch from FR1 to FR2 indicator as the main workplace  accident  indicator  for  2021.  Several  pre initiatives allow us to set a baseline which will allow us to drive  the  FR2  indicator  down  below  the  FR1  indicator over time whilst keeping the FR1 stable. FR2 corresponds to  the  frequency rate of workplace accidents with sick leave.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  promoting  1 st aid  acts  accidents  and continues  to  improve  the  declaration  process,  even  in countries where such accidents are not legally requested  to  be  declared.  The  reporting  scope  is  now exhaustive,  covering  all  sites,  including  small  offices sites that were not covered until 2020.\n\nPreventative and corrective actions, among which those described  above,  have  been  implemented  on  all  sites and an in-depth work with temporary workers agencies has been carried-out, enabling to decrease FR2 from 3.7 at its highest level in 2018 to 1.8 in 2021.",

Commuting accidents  covers  any  accident  occurring  on  the  public highway e.g. between the workplace and home, between the workplace and a supplier's site, between home and a supplier's site, etc.\n\nTraffic  accidents  that  occur  within  the  geographical coverage  of  Renault  sites  are  monitored  as  part  of  the workplace accident frequency rate.\n\nIn  countries  where information about traffic accidents is available to employers, the company can use this data to consolidate the figures and draw up robust action plans.\n\nInformation  on  Renault  Group's  actions  to  reduce  road accidents is provided in the CSR section of the URD (see section 2.3.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health\n\nThe Industrial health department consists of 11 dedicated experts.  They  manage  a  wide  range  of  health-related topics  including,  among  others,  the  control  of  workers' exposure to hazardous substances and chemical compliance covering the CLP/GHS/REACH regulations.\n\nOur primary objective is to reduce the number of the most hazardous  chemical  substances  used  on  Renault  Group sites, including products containing Cancerogenic, Mutagenic  and  Reprotoxic  substances  and  endocrine disruptors substances. Since 2010, we have eliminated or avoided  the  use  of  around  530  hazardous  chemicals, among which 70 in 2021.\n\nAfter  the  launch  of  eight  Health  &  industrial  hygiene mandatory rules in 2020, the industrial health department has  trained  the  whole  Health  and  Safety  network  with more  than  300  people  trained  in  2021.  All  industrial  sites have  performed  their  compliance  self-assessment  and sites  with  other  activities  (engineering,  sales  and  aftersales, offices\u2026) are currently starting to launch theirs.\n\nSimultaneously 50 hours of training on dangerous goods transport regulations for almost 80 people were provided, mainly to support Li-ion battery projects.\n\nMental health and wellbeing at work are acknowledged as major  improvement  opportunities.  Renault  Group  is clearly  affirming  its  commitment  to  promoting  mental health  wellness  as  part  of  the  Occupational  Health  and Safety  Policy  signed  in  2021.  Concretely,  a  dedicated Health Mandatory Rule, based on specific key requirements related to mental health management, has been  created  in  partnership  with  the  HSEE  division,  the coordinating doctors and the country's HR management, and will be gradually deployed to all Group sites in 2022.\n\n## Environment\n\nThe  Environment  Department  includes  20  experts  in various  fields  of  environmental  engineering  such  as  soil remediation,  air  emissions/climate  change,  waste  and water management, regulation, biodiversity preservation, legionella,  noise,  and  environmental  management.  The activities,  achievements  and  targets  of  this  Department, in  full  coherence  with  Group  ESG  pillars,  are  extensively described in the 'Environment' section of this report.\n\nThe  environmental  risk  mapping  will  be  enhanced  by  the implementation of the '8 Environmental Mandatory Rules / 50  key  requirements',  a  new  tool  built  on  the  back  of  the success  of  Safety  Mandatory  Rules,  that  captures  all relevant Environmental topics. The 8 Mandatory Rules is the set of rules to be applied in Renault Group to ensure that its activities will not  generate  important  risks  from  an environmental  point  of  view,  whether  for  human  health, ecosystems  or  for  the  sustainability  of  the  company. The regular self-assessment of the sites status with respect to these  rules,  reinforced  by  controls  on  sites,  will strengthen the existing risks analysis and will facilitate the treatment of the most important points.\n\nI",

The Mandatory Rules will  be  100%  deployed  in  other  sites  (Logistic,  Sales, Aftersales,  &  Engineering)  by  2023.  Over  a  3-year timeframe,  the  whole  scope  will  be  covered  and  selfassessment checked by internal audits/controls.\n\n## 2.3.2.1.5. Occupational illnesses  EFPD3a\n\nThe figures communicated are all reported occupational illnesses. After analysis by the authorities, some of the illnesses are declared as not attributable to Renault.  However,  there  are  all  included  in  the  data reported on the below chart.\n\nThe steady downward trend in the occupational illness rate  came  to  a  halt  in  2020.  The  process  for  declaring occupational illnesses in Romania, simplified at the end of  2019  and  therefore  in  place  throughout  the  whole  of 2020, explains this change.\n\nMore than 80% of occupational illnesses are musculoskeletal  conditions.  This  demonstrates  even more  the  importance  of  the  Ergonomics  Mandatory Rules  implemented  in  new  projects  and  on  sites. Industrial hygiene  occupational  illnesses  (<  20%), representing mainly illnesses related to exposures from the distant past are also covered by health action plans.\n\nMore generally, improved project integration since mid2018 will contribute to future progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group absenteeism EFPD2b\n\nThe  rates  vary  greatly  from  one  country  to  another, particularly  because  of  the  extent  of  social  security coverage (whether provision is covered by public bodies or  not).  The  rates  changed  very  differently  in  2021 compared  to  2020,  depending  on  the  impact  ofthe health  crisis  in  the  different  countries.  Overall,  the increase  remains  limited,  with  a  rate  of  3.85%  in  2021 compared to 3.61% in 2020.\n\nThe absenteeism rate is expressed as a percentage and is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  average  monthly workforce and the yearly theoretical number of working days.  The  number  of  days  of  absence  is  expressed  in working  days,  excluding  short-time  working,  layoffs, strikes,  training  and  leave  (including  maternity  and paternity  leave).  An  explanation  of  the  calculation method is available in Appendix 2.6.2.\n\n## 2.3.2.2. Promoting diversity, development and employee commitment\n\nIn 2021,  Renault  Group's  human  capital  comprised 156,466  women  and  men  in  the  150  entities  and  38 countries  in  which  it  operates.  Each  and  every  one  of them uses their commitment and skills to make mobility sustainable  and  accessible  to  all,  worldwide,  while reflecting society's depth and diversity. Renault Group is committed to  sustainable  and  responsible  growth  and implements  a  global,  fair  and  competitive  HR  policy. HR principles, standards and processes provide a shared frame of reference, which ensures fairness and transparency for all employees. To continue to adapt to transformed roles in the automotive sector and to shape future  mobility,  the  Group  has  introduced  an  HR  policy with  a  global  vision  to  ensure  that  Renault  Group  as  a Company is fast-moving, innovative, effective and eager to learn. This policy is based on high-quality social dialog at  both  local  and  global  levels,  and  is  focused  on  five priorities:\n\n- \u25cf be  sustainably  competitive,  while  complying  with codes of ethics and regulations to maintain employee health and safety;\n- \u25cf attract and develop all talent;\n- \u25cf implement  management  approaches  that  empower their teams;\n- \u25cf promote an inclusive culture;\n- \u25cf engage  our  employees  and  enhance  their  employee experience.",

Ensuring the necessary resources and skills\n\nAt  a  time  of  digital  revolution  and  the  emergence  of disruptive technologies at an increasing pace, the skills set needed  by  the  company  is  changing.  All  levels  of qualification are affected by these transformations. Moreover,  identification  of  talent  is  taking  place  in  an increasingly competitive  market  not  confined  to  the automotive  sector.  To  anticipate  and  adapt  to  these  rapid changes,  Renault  Group  recruits  employees  with  a  wide range  of  profiles  and  expertise  in  all  the  regions  where it operates.\n\n## A. Optimizing the allocation of resources\n\n2021 was marked by a reduction in the Group's workforce throughout the world. This decline, which can be observed in  almost  all  entities  of  the  Automotive  Division,  was mainly due to the adaptation of the production workforce to  market  demand,  for  each  product  and  region,  and  to the productivity efforts made at each industrial site.\n\nOptimization plans have also been successful in reducing the indirect workforce, particularly in France, while shoring up the Group's ability to innovate and develop the electric, connected, autonomous and shared vehicles of tomorrow.\n\n## a) Breakdown of workforce by country over three years and average headcount EFPD1a EFPD1d\n\n| Scope of labor reporting                | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    | Percentage in 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------------|\n| Group* (permanent + fixed-term)         | 179,565 | 170,158 | 156,466 |                      |\n| Argentina                               | 2,645   | 2,223   | 2,147   | 1.4%                 |\n| Brazil                                  | 7,484   | 6,583   | 5,693   | 3.6%                 |\n| France                                  | 47,978  | 46,250  | 41,613  | 26.6%                |\n| India                                   | 5,026   | 4,654   | 4,334   | 2.8%                 |\n| Morocco                                 | 9,535   | 9,139   | 9,059   | 5.8%                 |\n| Romania                                 | 17,528  | 16,555  | 15,494  | 9.9%                 |\n| Russia                                  | 3,753   | 3,012   | 2,764   | 1.8%                 |\n| Slovenia                                | 3,244   | 2,543   | 2,215   | 1.4%                 |\n| South Korea                             | 4,355   | 4,114   | 3,738   | 2.4%                 |\n| Spain                                   | 13,066  | 12,049  | 10,396  | 6.6%                 |\n| Turkey                                  | 7,031   | 6,894   | 6,313   | 4.0%                 |\n| Other countries                         | 11,563  | 11,727  | 10,723  | 6.9%                 |\n| AVTOVAZ Group                           | 46,357  | 44,415  | 41,977  | 26.8%                |\n| Average Group workforce without AVTOVAZ | 133,810 | 129,476 | 120,116 |                      |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Group's workforce (permanent + fixed-term contracts), including AVTOVAZ, totaled 156,466 employees, with 152,614 in the Automotive Division and 3,852 in the Finance Division.\n\nThe  Group  has  employees  in  38  countries.  The  '11  major  countries'  (Argentina,  Brazil,  France,  India,  Morocco,  Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain and Turkey), together with the AVTOVAZ group, account for 93.1% of the total number of employees.\n\n## b) Breakdown of recruitment EFPD1e\n\nThe number of new hires remained stable compared with 2020 at 13,647 people (13,197 in 2020). This level of recruitment has made it possible to adapt the Group to automotive market conditions. These recruitments made it possible to bolster the skills  needed  to  develop  the  mobility  solutions  of  the  future,  and  strengthen  the  capabilities  of  the  Finance  Division  to develop new services and adapt to changes in regulations.\n\nI",

On this point, the Group offers women a range of tools to assist with their development (mentoring, coaching and specific training schemes),  enabling  them  to  fulfill  their  potential  and demonstrate their leadership.\n\nIn  addition to the training programs which have already been  rolled  out  in  recent  years  for  women  during  their careers, in 2018 the Group has created a specific training course,  in  partnership  with  the  London  Business  School, which helps Renault's female employees to access roles at the highest level of responsibility. The Group also offers a  new  program  for  women  in  middle  management  in partnership with SKEMA Business School.\n\nIn  December  2020,  Renault  Group  signed  the  #StOpE Charter  (Stop  Everyday  Sexism  in  the  Workplace).  In 2021, Renault  Group  launched  a  global  campaign against everyday sexism.\n\n## c) Sexual orientation and gender identity\n\nIn 2020, Renault Group signed the United Nations Free & Equal  standards  against  the  discrimination  of  LGBT+ people and, in France, the Autre Cercle Charter.\n\nIn 2012,  the  group's  employees  created  the  We'R OutStandInG  (LGBT+  and  partners) network. The network's  initiatives  and  support  for  LGBT+  employees help  to  create  an  inclusive  work  environment  in  which everyone  can  participate  and  flourish,  regardless  of their sexual orientation or gender identity. The network primarily  provides  support  to  people  in  transition  and victims  of  discrimination,  thanks  in  particular  to  the LGBT+ advisers deployed in the plants in France.\n\n## d) Promoting talent at all ages EFPD1c\n\nRecruitment  plans  have  made  it  possible  to  limit  the ageing  of  the  workforce  and  maintain  a  balanced distribution by age group: 11.9% are under age 30, 29.5% are  between  30  and  39,  33.3%  are  between  40  and  49 and 25.4% are over 50 years old.\n\n## Breakdown of workforce by age group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe breakdown by age group is calculated on the global scope as of December 31, 2021.\n\nRenault  seeks  to  develop  its  employees  at  all  ages, notably  helping  young  people  enter  the  world  of  work through  numerous  initiatives  (see  chapter  2.4.3.1),  while at the same time drawing on the experience of seniors.\n\n## e) Integration  of  people  with  disabilities  into  the workforce  EFPD6b EFPD6d\n\nThe Company  has  embarked  on  the  worldwide coordination  of  its  disability  policy,  creating  a  link between  all  country  initiatives.

Since  2020,  the  Group's ambition is to ask the countries in which it operates, and where  there  is  no  legal  obligation  on  this  matter,  to ensure that people with disabilities make up at least 2% of its employees\n\n## C. Performance appraisal and competitive compensation policy\n\nRenault  Group  has  a  tool,  People@Renault,  which includes the comprehensive management of employee files, performance  monitoring  and  appraisal,  and employee compensation (white collar only). Depending on the subject area, this tool is designed to be used by employees, managers and HR staff.\n\nIt  is  deployed  in  38  Group  countries  and  enables  the Group  to  be  fairer,  more  competitive  and  more  digital wherever it operates.",

Furthermore,  the  evaluation  is  based  on  a discussion  between  manager  and  employee  during  the annual  performance  review.  Employees  are  invited  to make a self-assessment in preparation for this meeting to enhance the discussion. The individual performance is an opportunity to look at the results of the past year, to set objectives  for  the  year  ahead,  and  to  discuss  the employee's contribution to the Company's performance.\n\nIf results fall short of expectations, an improvement plan is implemented by the manager and employee to restore a dynamic to individual performance.\n\nRegular  performance  reviews  throughout  the  year  are highly  recommended  in  order  to  ensure  continuous professional development.\n\n## b) Employee development\n\nPeople@Renault  provides  a  way  to  share  common policies  and  practices  in  employee  development  (white collar) at Group level, such as reviewing training requests or defining criteria for selecting high-potential individuals, as well as the systematic implementation of development programs  for  those  individuals,  which  include  a  career plan.\n\nPeople@Renault  is  also  a  tool  which  enables  effective management of the succession plans for key positions in the Company.\n\n## c)  Employee compensation EFPD1g\n\nThe compensation of white-collar staff is based on:\n\n- \u25cf the level of responsibility . Positions have been assessed according  to  their  level  of  responsibility,  using  to  the Korn Ferry international methodology. This assessment allows  for  a  complete  mapping  of  the  positions internally.  Another  advantage  is  that  Renault  can compare  its  pay  scales  with  the  market  to  better manage competitiveness and the attractiveness of the compensation policy;\n- \u25cf the level of individual  contribution  made  to  the company , assessed through the degree of achievement of the objectives set and the behaviors implemented to achieve these objectives.\n\nThe variable part of the compensation of managers and executives  is  calculated  according  to  the  following principles:\n\n- \u25cf the  higher  the  level  of  responsibility,  the  higher  the percentage of variable compensation;\n- \u25cf a single model for the variable portion of compensation recognizing  the  performance  of  the  employee  and  the Group in a spirit of solidarity.\n- \u25cf For 2021, the health crisis led the company to implement strong wage moderation in several countries. However, specific budgets were maintained to reduce the gender pay gap in the countries concerned.\n\nThe  compensation  of  senior  executives  is  discussed  in chapter 3.2.\n\n## d) Group profit-sharing\n\nRenault has an incentive scheme for employees in France that includes the redistribution of Renault Group profits as well as bonus  payments  for  contributions  to  site performance.\n\nOn the Group side, Renault has for the first time introduced an  extra-financial  criterion,  namely  compliance  by  2020 with the European  CAFE  (Corporate  Average  Fuel Economy) regulation for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\n## EXERCISE 2021\n\nThe agreement of July 3, 2020, signed for 2021 and which was  paid  to  employees  in  March  2022,  includes,  as  for previous agreements, two components:\n\n- \u25cf profit-sharing linked to the Group's operating margin;\n- \u25cf local incentive schemes based on site performance.\n\nOver the past three years, profit-sharing and performance-related bonuses at Renault s.a.s. totaled the following amounts:\n\n|   Year  (\u20ac million) |   Aggregate amount: financial incentive + performance-related bonuses |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                2019 |                                                                 176.4 |\n|                2020 |                                                                 121.5 |\n|                2021 |                                                                 122.4 |\n\n## e) Employee stock ownership and savings\n\nIn France, Renault operates a voluntary company savings plan  open  to  all  subsidiaries  that  are  more  than  50 % owned. The plan consists of seven employee mutual funds (FCPE)  invested  in  accordance  with  socially  responsible investment  (SRI)  standards  and  endorsed  by  the  Labor Union Employee Savings Committee (Comit\u00e9 Intersyndical de l'\u00c9pargne Salariale), and two FCPE funds invested in company stock (Renault share, ISIN code  FR0000131906).  The  securities  held  in  the  SRI portfolios  are  selected  on  the  basis  of  the  issuer's employment  policies, working conditions, corporate governance and compliance with environmental standards.  Employees  can  make  top-up  payments  into these  seven  savings  funds  and  the  Renault  Action  fund\n\nI",

With  this  system,  employees  can  pay  their profit-sharing  bonuses,  voluntary  payments  (whether tax deductible or not, and with an additional contribution from Renault) or part of their individual time savings leave (CTI, up to 10 days per year) into the plan. In addition, Renault contributes the equivalent of 30 % of the CTI days paid into the plan.\n\nEmployees  can  choose  between  free  management  of their savings, the funds proposed as part of the selected Group savings plan (with the exception of the Company share  ownership  funds)  or  management  through  the\n\ngenerational funds in the BNP PARIBAS PERSPECTIVES range.\n\nIn  2021,  total  payments into Renault's Group retirement savings  scheme  amounted  to  \u20ac15.80  million,  of  which 27.2 % came from the cash-out of paid leave.\n\nThe  total  value  of  Renault's  company  savings  plans  at December  31,  2021,  was  \u20ac924.58  million  (see  appendix 2.5.2).\n\nSince December 2015, BNP PARIBAS E&RE has managed the Company savings plan and PERECO for Renault.\n\n## f) Control of labor costs\n\nThe Group's labor costs stood at \u20ac5,959 million in 2021, of which  \u20ac5,648  million  was  for  the  Automotive  Division. They  were  down  compared  with  2020,  thanks  to  the Group's actions to adapt to the crisis in the automotive markets as well as productivity and streamlining efforts. The '11 major countries' (Argentina, Brazil, France, India, Morocco, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain and  Turkey), together with the AVTOVAZ  group, represent 88% of the Group's payroll costs.\n\n| Labor costs by country   | 2019    | 2020    | 2021    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Group                    | 6,706   | 6,157   | 5,959   |\n| Argentina                | 61.8    | 49.8    | 69.1    |\n| Brazil                   | 257.7   | 175.6   | 149.8   |\n| France                   | 3,473.6 | 3,132.7 | 3,128.8 |\n| India                    | 91.5    | 83.5    | 71.6    |\n| Morocco                  | 158.5   | 148.0   | 160.1   |\n| Romania                  | 410.4   | 359.6   | 375.9   |\n| Russia                   | 83.3    | 62.7    | 62.6    |\n| Slovenia                 | 96.5    | 84.9    | 68.8    |\n| South Korea              | 273.7   | 250.6   | 222.6   |\n| Spain                    | 564.0   | 505.3   | 445.1   |\n| Turkey                   | 141.0   | 106.0   | 96.0    |\n| Other countries          | 627.5   | 794.5   | 715.8   |\n| AVTOVAZ Group            | 466.1   | 403.9   | 393.1   |\n\n## 2.3.2.4. Social dialogue\n\nYear after year, Renault Group confirms its determination to use social dialogue to build a world of work in  a  constantly  shifting  environment,  whether  at the global or local level.\n\nThis  determination  is  reflected  in  particular  in  the signature of Global Framework Agreements that make it possible to reconcile the interests of both the Group and its employees.\n\nThe Group's first Global Framework Agreement 'Committing together for sustainable growth and development'  dates  back  to  July  2,  2013.  This  agreement between the Management of Renault Group, the members of the Group Works Council and IndustriALL Global Union, this agreement  sets out the social, societal and environmental responsibility of the Group. The signatories have committed themselves to five major lines of actions:\n\n- \u25cf respect for fundamental social rights;\n- \u25cf social responsibility toward employees;",

It also responds to the expectations expressed by  employees,  reinforced  since  the  health  crisis,  on  the possibility  of  mixing  on-site  work  and  teleworking  to improve  the  balance  between  private  and  professional life. This new hybrid organization of work at Renault Group aims  to  get  the  best  out  of  on-site  activities  and teleworking and operates on a voluntary basis. It is based on the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf more  flexibility in personal  organization  of  work: organization  of  the  week  between  teleworking  and  onsite work with a minimum of two days of teleworking and maintaining at least 20% of monthly work time on site;\n- \u25cf empowerment  and  autonomy:  based  on  individual objectives, free organization of individual, collaborative work and on-site meetings with the team;\n- \u25cf respect for work/life balance: respect for the company's working  hours  as  well  as  for  break  and  holiday  times (right to disconnect).\n\nThese  two  Global  Framework  Agreements  and  the addendum constitute structuring social dialog themes.\n\n## A. The  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council,  a  forum  for responsible social dialogue  EFPD4a\n\nThe Worldwide Group Works Council has 40 members:\n\n- \u25cf European Economic Area: 31 members ;\n- \u25cf other  countries:  nine  members  (Argentina,  Brazil,  South Korea, India, Morocco, Russia and Turkey).\n\nIt is the essential  forum  for  social  dialogue  at  the international  level :  its  members  regularly  discuss  major changes in  the  Group  and  its  strategic  orientations  with the Group's General  Management  and  operational departments.  When  an  exceptional  proposed  decision has  transnational  consequences  likely  to  significantly affect  the  interests  of  employees,  the  Group  Works Council meets as a European Works Council.\n\n2021 was  marked  by  an  unfavorable  environment, particularly  due  to  the  consequences of the health crisis and the shortage of semiconductor components, resulting in furlough measures or work time adjustments.\n\nIn  this  very  particular  context, maintaining  permanent social  dialogue  was  essential to  provide  employees with appropriate support.\n\nThe Group Works Council met 33 times in 2021: 7 internal meetings, 1 Worldwide meeting for the presentation of the new  'Renaulution'  strategic  plan,  5  meetings  for  the negotiation of the addendum  to  the  2019  Global Framework  Agreement,  12  meetings  of  the  restricted Group  Works  Council,  2  extraordinary  information  and consultation  sessions  in  European  configuration,  on  the proposed Renault Retail Group strategy and the project to convert  subsidiaries  in  Europe  to  importer  status,  2 meetings  to  follow  up  on  the  agreements,  1  focus  group meeting  of  Group  Works  Council  members  on  the employee listening platform project and 3 days of plenary sessions.\n\nDue to health measures and travel restrictions around the world, the plenary session of the Group Works Council was held for the first  time  remotely  with  all  members  from  18 different countries on November 5, 19 and 29, 2021.\n\nMr. De Meo gave an introduction on the Group's situation and strategic  guidance  with  significant  time  for  questions  and answers. The agenda was built in line with the Group's new organization around brands (Renault, Mobilize, Alpine, Dacia and LADA) and functions (human resources, engineering and industry)  with  a  prospective  sequence  at  the  end  of  the plenary session on artificial intelligence and the autonomous car.  The  plenary  session  was  also  supplemented  by  three presentations  related  to  the  monitoring  of  the  Global Framework Agreements on Ethics and Compliance, Health, Safety,  Environment  and  Ergonomics  and  the  Group's sustainable development strategy.\n\n'In 2021, the Renault Worldwide Group Works Council has made a significant contribution to the transformation of Renault Group. In addition to the 2021 plenary session, the company asked the Renault Group Works Council on two occasions,  for  information  and  consultation,  about  the transformation of commerce in Europe.\n\nThe  Renault  Group  Works  Council  also  negotiated  and signed the addendum  to the Global Framework\n\nI",

Thanks to this unanimous  agreement,  every  employee  of  Renault Group  now  has  a  framework  for  teleworking.  This agreement, signed on April 26, 2021, has resulted in a rollout in 14 countries.\n\nThrough  these  exchanges  and  this  addendum,  the activity of the Renault Group Works Council shows once again  that  social  dialogue  is  key  to  the  company's performance  and  to  the  satisfaction  of  Renault  Group employees'.\n\n\u00c9ric  Vidal,  Secretary  of  the  Worldwide  Group  Works Council.\n\n## B. A flexible organization of work  EFPD2a\n\nRenault  Group  complies  with  the  legal  obligations  and collective agreements in terms of working hours of the countries where it has operations.\n\nTo preserve jobs and adapt to fluctuations in automotive markets, Renault has instituted a system of flexible  work  time.  It  aims  to  find  the  best  possible balance  between  the  Company's  interests  and  quality of  life  in  the  workplace  for  the  employees  in  question, through  consultations  with  employee  representatives and  labor  unions.  The  measures  focus  in  particular  on the  conditions  for  reorganizing  work  time,  such  as  by adding  mandatory  shifts  to  meet  heavy  demand  or reducing work time when demand falls, notably by using individual or collective rest days.\n\nAt  sites  in  France,  for  example,  the  average  working week  is  35  hours.  In  plants,  the  principle  is  two alternating eight-hour shifts with, in the event of spiking demand, the possibility to add a fixed night shift team.\n\nRenault Group is also implementing a flexible, innovative,  hybrid  organization  of  work  that  includes  a proportion of on-site work  and  a  proportion  of teleworking. This principle of hybrid work was materialized by the unanimous signing on April 26, 2021, of an addendum to the Global Framework Agreement of July 9, 2019, specifying the conditions for teleworking by Renault Group employees.\n\nIt was  rolled  out  worldwide  in  2021  in  line  with  the opportunities  created  by  the  evolution  of  the  COVID pandemic. It provides the general framework, and allows for  local  adaptations  to  take  into  account  specific aspects related to the activity or culture of the country.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  2021  agreement  are,  first,  to determine  eligibility  for  hybrid  work  on  the  basis  of objective criteria related to working activity. Secondly, it makes the proposed new hybrid organization voluntary. Lastly,  it provides  for  a  minimum  of  two  days  of teleworking per week for eligible groups of people and a minimum  of  on-site  work  estimated  at  around  20%  of monthly working time in order to maintain a connection with other team members as well as with the company.\n\nOn this flexible, simple basis, a very rich social dialogue has taken place all over the world, which has led to local agreements (e.g. in France, Romania and Germany) or to the publication of new human resources policies (e.g. in India, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Russia).\n\nBy  the  end  of  2021,  over 90%  of  eligible  employees ,  or more than 26,000 worldwide ,  had voluntarily adopted a hybrid  organization  of  work .  This  profound  change  in the  organization  of  work  has  been  accompanied  by equally important changes in the way people work. New uses of technology have been found with the widespread use of videoconferencing tools, the sharing of documents in the cloud and the limitation of emails in favor  of  conversations  by  chat.  In  addition  to  the  CO2 savings and the reduction of road accidents associated with the limitation of business trips, everyone recognizes the benefits of hybrid work in terms of work/life balance. Renault  Group  also  welcomes  the  fact  that  meetings have become more efficient and that time is freed up for oneself  and  for  more  concentrated  work.  Finally,  there are  positive  side  effects  of  the  hybrid  mode  on inclusiveness,  particularly  for  international  teams  who have learned to work better together in hybrid mode.\n\nIn  France ,  the  continued  use  of  teleworking  for  health reasons  has  profoundly  changed  the  approach  to organization  of  work.  It  was  therefore  important  to  reexamine the recent teleworking agreement of February 7, 2019. Following the surveys and workshops held at the end of  2020,  the  group  initiated  discussions  with  its  social partners  in  the  form  of  joint  discussion  groups  (three meetings) and then negotiations, which led to the signing of  an  agreement  on  new  working  methods  on  June  10, 2021.  This  agreement  sets  out  the  main  principles  of  the above-mentioned global addendum for France. It defines a standard hybrid organization of work formula with two to  three  days  of  teleworking  per  week.  Furthermore,  it establishes the principle of the evolution of tertiary sites by  gradually  putting  in  place  new  dynamic  workspaces. As  of  the  end  of  2021,  almost  88%  of  eligible  employees had registered for the new plan.\n\nImplemented in 2021, the new organization of work will be evaluated both in terms of employee satisfaction and in  terms  of  improved  team  efficiency.  It  also  opens  up opportunities  in  terms  of  the  real  estate  footprint  and the possibility of redesigning less occupied workplaces to make them even more dynamic and collaborative.\n\n## C. Long-term convergence between Group performance and employee quality of life in the workplace\n\nRenault  Group  endeavors  to  offer  all  its  employees  an environment and working relationships that are favorable  to  their  individual  development  and  their quality of life at work improvement.\n\nWorking  environments  are  gradually  becoming  more flexible  and,  by  improving  quality  of  life,  enhance  the performance of the Company.\n\nThe prevention of psychosocial risks and the promotion of  psychological  health  remain  a  priority  for  Renault Group. To provide the best possible support  to employees in the context of the health crisis, a support system  has  been  put  in  place.  In  France,  this  relies  on occupational  health  services,  facilitators  and  coaches within  the  company,  and  aims  to  help  employees  and managers  live  and  organize  work  as  efficiently  as possible in this new context.",

Initiated in 2020, this approach, based on the COPSOQ (Copenhagen  Psychosocial  Questionnaire),  aimed  to identify  risk  and  protection  factors  within  the  company. The  analysis  of  the  results  led  to  the  implementation  of appropriate action plans within the various business lines. In  addition,  the  skills  transformation  agreement,  CAR  21, which includes a psychosocial risk support and prevention mechanism, has enabled the deployment of tools in this area, aimed at developing primary, secondary and tertiary risk prevention.  In  the  area  of  primary  prevention, extensive communication has been deployed as well as elearning training for everyone on awareness of psychosocial risks. With regard to secondary prevention, several  training  sessions  were  held  for  all  stakeholders, employees, managers and staff representatives. Lastly, to strengthen  tertiary  prevention,  the  support  measures were enhanced through an increased use of psychologists as well as the reaffirmed role of our internal facilitators  and  coaches.  To  measure  the  effect  of  all these actions, a monthly barometer, partly based on the health survey questionnaire, was conducted on the scope of the agreement during the first three quarters.\n\n## D. Ongoing local social dialogue  EFPD4b   EFPD4c\n\nThe social  dialogue  at  Renault  in  France in  2021  was structured around three main topics:\n\n- \u25cf deployment of the Renaulution plan and outcome of the skills transformation plan;\n- \u25cf management of the health crisis and the semiconductor crisis;\n- \u25cf negotiations  on  a  multiyear  agreement  for  France proposing a comprehensive, ambitious plan to transform  the  Group  and  strengthen  its  long-term performance.\n\n## Outcome of the skills transformation plan\n\nIn France ,  the  agreement on the Transformation of Skills in the Corporate Functions, signed on November 20, 2020, by  the  CFDT,  the  CFE-CGC  and  the  FO  concerning  the reinforcement  of  skills,  the  adaptation  of  staffing  levels and  the  facilitation  of  local  social  dialogue  within  the business  lines,  gave  rise  to  an  assessment  of  its implementation at the Monitoring Committee meeting of October 11, 2021.\n\nOn  that  occasion,  a  progress  report  on  the  indicators  of mobility, training, recruitment and quantitative adjustment of the workforce through the RCC and the DA was  provided.  Indicators  related  to  prevention  and psychosocial  monitoring  were  also  shared.  All  these elements made it possible to share a positive assessment of the deployment of all the measures provided for in this agreement.\n\n## Management of the health crisis and the semiconductor crisis\n\nIn  France ,  the  continuation  of  the  health  crisis  as  well  as the semiconductor component crisis led the Company to negotiate  a new  Solidarity  and  Future  Contract  (CSA2) , establishing  how  the  furloughs  are  managed  and  how training can  be  accessed  during  this  period  and committing itself to guarantee 100% of its employees' net pay in keeping with the first Solidarity and Future Contract signed  on  April  2,  2020.  This  new  agreement  was  signed on  January  27,  2021,  by  the  CFDT,  CFE-CGC  and  FO  labor unions.\n\nThe Solidary and Future Contract 2 was supplemented by a Long-Term Furlough Agreement dated March 1, 2021.\n\nThese  two  agreements  provided  support  in  the  face  of these crises, particularly at the industrial site level.\n\nThe CSA2 was the subject of an addendum signed by the same  labor  unions  on  October  20,  2021,  to  extend  the support  mechanism  until  the  end  of  February  2022.  This addendum  also  made  the  use  of  solidarity  funds  more fluid  to  allow  some  employees  with  insufficient  rights  to contribute to the solidarity mechanism.\n\nAs such, in the common desire to use the solidarity fund, the agreement of June 30, 2011, on furlough compensation was also the subject of an addendum and was signed by the CFDT, CFE-CGC and FO labor unions. This agreement makes it possible to pool the various solidarity funds and to deploy them at the level of all the French entities within the scope of the CSA2.\n\nThe continuation of the health crisis and the semiconductor crisis in 2022 will lead to a continuation of a dynamic  social  dialog  on  the  social  support  of employees.\n\nInternationally , exchanges with local unions were intensified following the semiconductor crisis by agreements  on  furlough  support  conditions  in  line  with local laws.\n\nSeveral  countries  (Brazil,  Slovenia,  Spain,  etc.)  have renewed  agreements  providing  a  framework  for  local employment  conditions  in  the  event  of  a  reduction  in industrial activity.\n\nNegotiations  on  a  multiyear  agreement  for  France proposing a comprehensive, ambitious plan to transform the Group and strengthen its long-term performance\n\nStarting  in  June  2021,  the  Management  invited  the  labor union  representatives  (OSR)  to  a Joint  Discussion  Group (GRP)  cycle to  share  with  them  a  complete,  transparent view of the Group's situation and prospects. A number of topics  were  discussed,  including  the  Group's  economic situation, the strategy of the major business lines, the real estate footprint, fixed costs, as well as the evolution of the workforce  and  the  actions  taken  or  to  be  taken  with regard to the transformation of business lines and skills.\n\nI\n\n02",

It includes an ambitious industrial plan with the allocation of nine vehicles as well as activity for all plants in the territory.\n\nThis agreement places French engineering at the heart of future technologies designed to meet the challenges of electrification, hydrogen and digital technology.\n\nIn  addition,  to  anchor  these  new  activities  for  the  long term, this agreement  contains  elements  likely  to improve  the  performance  and  effectiveness  of  the Group's operations in France:\n\n- \u25cf Adjustments to the organization of work time.\n- \u25cf Real estate transformation.\n- \u25cf Transformation of employment and skills: Throughout the country, there were 2,500 recruitments, integrating the Group's diversity issues, the creation of an internal university  and  a  commitment  to  10,000  training  and retraining courses.\n- \u25cf Indirect staff adjustment.\n\nLastly,  a new  Employment  and  Career  Management system  (GEPP) was  also  developed  and  offered  as  a dynamic response to the challenges of transforming the skills  of  the  Group's  employees  toward  preparation  for the new automotive value chain.\n\nOn  December  7,  2021,  during  the  read-through  session for  this  draft  multiyear  agreement  for  France,  a  name was  proposed  for  the  agreement:  ' Re-Nouveau  France 2025 '.\n\nThis agreement was signed on December 14, 2021, by the CFE-CGC, the CFDT and the FO.\n\n- E. Increasingly  heightened  and  broadened  vigilance  on respect  for  fundamental  social  rights  EFPD4a  EFPD6a EFPD6b  EFPD6c  EFPD6d  EFPD17a  EFPD17c  EFPD17d EFPD18\n\n## A historical commitment\n\nIn October 2004, Renault Group published a ' Declaration of Employees' Fundamental Rights' .\n\nThe two Global Framework Agreements renew, strengthen  and  complement  these  commitments,  in particular with regard to the effective abolition of child labor, the elimination of all forms  of  forced  or compulsory  labor,  the  elimination  of  discrimination  in respect  of  employment  and  occupation,  freedom  of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.\n\nThe  2013  agreement  thus  refers  to International  Labor Organization  Conventions  Nos.  87,135  and  98 on freedom  of  association,  protection  of  the  right  to organize,  workers'  representatives  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining.  It  also  incorporates  Conventions Nos. 29 and 105 on the abolition of forced labor and Nos. 138 and 182 on  the effective abolition of child labor and the minimum age. Finally, it includes Conventions No. 111 on  the  prevention  of  discrimination,  No. 100 on  equal compensation and No. 158 on termination of employment.\n\nThe 2019 agreement incorporates, in the same year that it was  adopted  by  the  ILO, Convention  No.  190 , disavowing  any  manifestation  of  workplace  violence, harassment in all its forms, particularly sexual or moral harassment, or discrimination against employees.\n\n## A vigilance  plan  in  terms  of  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms in consultation with internal and external social actors  DV1a\n\nAs part of the implementation of French Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017, on the duty of vigilance, a mechanism has been implemented for the monitoring of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The aim is, in light of our industrial and  commercial  activities  and  the  diversity  of  the countries  in  which  Renault  operates,  to  identify  the  risks incurred  and  to  draw  up  a map,  based  in  particular  on reports  published  by  the  ILO ,  which  may  go  beyond  the fundamental  social  rights  identified  within  the  Global Framework  Agreements.  It  is  on  this  basis  that  Renault Group  has  decided  to  pay  particular  attention  to  the implementation of ILO Convention No. 100 (Equal Compensation) and ILO Convention No. 111 (Discrimination, Employment and Occupation).",

Any  alerts  are  addressed  in  a  specific  item during the plenary sessions of the Group Worldwide Works Council.  In  2021,  a  specific  updated  was  provided  on  this subject on November 5 with all the members of the Group Works Council.\n\n## Assessment  and  monitoring  of  measures  implemented DV2a\n\nThe  results  of  this  additional  vigilance  are  regularly assessed  and  monitored  as  part  of  annual  follow-up meetings  between  the  Worldwide  Group  Works  Council and  the  Renault  Group  Works  Council.  Please  note  that two  chapters  of  the  new  2019  Global  Framework Agreement  are  devoted  to  the  Group's  sustainable commitment to inclusion and respect for people.\n\n## Risk mitigation actions  DV3a\n\n89.76%  of  the  Group's  employees  are  covered  by  a collective bargaining agreement  at  branch  and/or company level.\n\nThe  Audit  Department  now  includes  knowledge  of  and compliance  with  Global  Framework  Agreements  in  its local audits of Human Resources practices.\n\nIn the event of any difficulty in applying these agreements, the  memorandum  concluded  in  January  2018  with  the signatories  of  the  2013  framework  agreement  provides practical guidance for both parties to deal with them jointly.\n\n## Effectiveness of measures  DV5a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  effectiveness  of  initiatives  in  place  is  measured notably by the number of incidents reported by signatory parties to Global Framework Agreements resulting in the implementation of the measures provided for in the 2018 memorandum.  No  incidents  were  measured  under  the memorandum in 2021.\n\n## A decisive criterion when  choosing  suppliers  and subcontractors DV3b\n\nRenault  Group  has  committed,  through  its  2013  Global Framework  Agreement,  to  ensuring  that  respect  for fundamental rights is a decisive criterion in the selection of suppliers and subcontractors. If necessary, corrective action plans  are  implemented  with  the  support  of  the  Group.  Any failure  not  corrected  after  observation  results  in  measures that  may  extend  to  the  termination  of  relations  with  the company in question (chapter 2.4.2 and policy accessible on the Renault Responsible Purchasing website).\n\n## Respect for people\n\nRenault  Group  counts  respect  for  privacy  and  the protection of its employees' personal data as\n\nfundamental  human  rights.  In  2021,  the  training  plan  on this  subject  continued  to  be  deployed  with,  in  particular, the implementation of a module dedicated to the Human Resources function. In addition, an information leaflet was distributed in France and the main European countries. An awareness-raising  campaign  on  everyday  sexism  was rolled out in the countries.\n\n## 2.3.2.5. Training to support skills development EFPD5\n\nRenault  Group  supports  the  skills  development  of  its employees  to  meet  its  sustainable  growth  and  social responsibility targets. The priorities of the training teams for 2021 were mainly focused on:\n\n- \u25cf Continuously  adapting  training  courses  to  operational needs.\n- \u25cf Increasing  the  accessibility  of  our  training  offer  and improving the learner experience.\n- \u25cf Developing  new  training  modalities  and  continuing  the digitalization of the training offer.\n- \u25cf Strengthening the Learning & Development community (composed of our functional academies, of the country and corporate L&D teams).\n\n## 1. Creation of ReKnow University.\n\nThe  automotive  sector  is  changing,  and  skills  in  data analysis  and  processing,  cybersecurity,  electrification, maintenance  and  recycling  of  vehicles  have  become essential.\n\nTo  support  this  transformation,  we  created  ReKnow University in 2021.\n\nThis new company university will support the transformation of mobility professions by ensuring the link between  initial  training  and  lifelong  learning  and  by bringing  together  various  players  (industrial,  academic, institutional) to design and  disseminate  innovative training courses.\n\nArticulated around  five themes  (electrical, circular economy, data, software and cybersecurity), this university  will  train  to  the  professions  of  the  automotive industry of the future.\n\nDedicated initially to Group employees in France, already trained more than 2,600 people in 2021 have been trained. Our  ambition  is  to  continue  to  train  nearly  10,000 employees by 2025.\n\nThe university's activities are being gradually extended to industrial partners in the sector with whom we share the design and delivery of professional training courses.\n\nFor  example,  by  actively  participating  in  the  creation  of the  E-Mobility  Academy  in  France,  Renault  Group  is investing in  the  development of the skills of its  industrial teams  through  the  design  of  training  modules  that  will enable it to support the team who will work on the electric motor production lines of tomorrow.\n\nI\n\n02",

Enhancing  access  to  training  and  improving  the learner experience\n\nNumerous  training  initiatives  have  been  taken  in  the countries  where  the  Group  operates  to  develop  skills and  talents  in  an  uncertain  economic  and  health context.  The  sustained  increase  in  the  training  access rate is one of the indicators that testify to this dynamic.\n\nFor example, Dacia in Romania launched a major digital training  program  for  its  industrial  teams  as  part  of  an initiative supported by European funds, and the training team  at  Oyak-Renault  in  Turkey  created  a  production studio  to  develop  training  content  in  the  form  of podcasts accessible to all the company's employees.\n\nIn  Brazil,  the  HR  team  deployed  a  remote  induction program for newcomers to prepare for the integration of employees  before  their  arrival  in  the  Group  ('preonboarding program').\n\nIn  addition,  the  commitment  of  the  community  of internal trainers and our function experts enabled us to deliver more than 843,000 hours of training to our teams, representing  more  than  49%  of  the  training  hours delivered in 2021 (and tracked in LEARNING@ALLIANCE).\n\nAt the same time, Renault Group continued to develop its learning  management  system  (LEARNING@ALLIANCE) by  making  it  easier  to  understand  the  training  offer through rapid access to targeted training on important themes  issues  (e.g. managing  a  team  remotely, improving language skills, etc.) while allowing individualized  paths  with  a  choice  of  training  subjects selected by each employee.\n\nOur  function  academies  are  strongly  involved  in  the development of quality training content for the benefit of  large  populations  of  employees.  For  example,  the Manufacturing  academy  developed  a  new  'Industrial Renaulution  master  class'  to  support  the  Industrial Departments in the digitalization of their activities.\n\nA study was conducted at the end of 2021 among 1,500 employees  in  engineering  and  industrial  functions  to identify  the  training  needs  and  expectations  of  our employees by 2030.\n\n## 3. Developing  new  usage  in  training  and  continuing digitalization\n\nThe link between the various players in skills development  has  also  been  strengthened  by  the mobilization  of  the  L&D  community:  the  Functional Academies,  our  Experts,  the  training  and  human resources teams at the head office and in the countries where Renault Group is based have all been mobilized to offer  remote  training,  particularly  during  health  crisis periods, adapted to a new hybrid way of working .\n\nIn connection with the agreement  reached  with employee representatives in France on this topic and in order  to  help  managers  prepare  for  its  effective implementation with their teams, an application developed  with  a  start-up  company  (Team  Bakery)  has made  it  possible  to  offer  turnkey  training  modules  and practical  advice  to  accompany  the  evolution  toward hybrid  teleworking  to  2,285  managers  in  France,  with  a high  level  of  satisfaction  assessed  for  these  workshops (4.22/5).\n\n2021 was also a year of diversity and inclusion.\n\nRenault  Group  specifically  aims  to  support  women  at key points in their career and to become the employer of choice for women in the automotive industry by 2025.\n\nTo  support  this  ambition,  a  new  training  program ('W-journey') was designed in collaboration with SKEMA Business School to help talented women take on greater responsibilities. This  six-month  online  development program  covers  topics  such  as  women's  leadership, understanding business issues, image and communication  management.  Groups  work  on  an innovative  project  and  collective  mentoring  round  out this ambitious  program.  This  program  started  in September  2021  and  has  already  welcomed  60 participants.\n\n2021  also  saw  the  continued  development  of  digital training  based  on  the  emergence  of  new  autonomous, remote training practices.\n\nThe  digital  learning  offer  was  strengthened  with  the posting  of  new  online  training  modules  developed  in particular by the Digital Learning Factory.\n\nAccess  to  training  from  a  mobile  application  available on  smartphones  has  also  been  activated  for  Group employees  located  in  pilot  countries  (France,  India, Morocco,  Spain,  etc.)  in  order  to  promote  e-learning, including during lockdown periods.\n\n352,035 hours  of  digital  training,  up 2.4% from  2020 (343,847  hours)  were  completed  by  Renault  Group employees, representing 16% of total training hours.",

Strengthening the Learning & Development community (composed  of  our  functional  academies,  country  and corporate L&D teams)\n\nThese  results  were  achieved  by  relying  on  a  strong, dynamic Learning & Development community located in 17 countries and 14 functional academies.\n\nThis community established a 'success plan' to define a common ambition, set priorities for action and coordinate activities between the various parties involved, which was structured in three parts:\n\n- 1. Human: to strengthen our working relationships.\n- 2. Technical: to develop skills development paths.\n- 3. Ecosystem  and  network:  to  facilitate  co-development and pooling of training actions.\n\nThis collective work made it possible to collectively define the  OKR  (Objectives  &  Key  Results)  for  the  Learning  & Development  community  in  2021  and  to  provide  agile support for the launch of ReKnow University in France.\n\nIn  2021,  the  total  number of training hours undertaken by people employed by the Group (on a temporary or permanent basis) as of December 31, 2021, stood at 2,196,010 hours (excluding AVTOVAZ) and 3,338,426 hours (including AVTOVAZ).\n\nThe breakdown of training hours by cluster* was as follows:\n\n|                             | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Americas                    |           | 142,938   | 144,100   |\n| AMI-Pacific                 |           | 365,928   | 374,492   |\n| China                       |           | 9,030     | 439       |\n| Eurasia (including AVTOVAZ) |           | 1,371,008 | 2,548,425 |\n| Eurasia (excluding AVTOVAZ) |           | 528,359   | 708,338   |\n| Europe (excluding France)   | 571,485   | 1,237,149 | 923,319   |\n| France                      | 623,725   | 569,831   | 939,094   |\n| LATIN AMERICA               | 163,918   |           |           |\n| INTERNATIONAL               | 466,440   |           |           |\n| BRRUM                       | 370,442   |           |           |\n| VAZ                         | 1,142,416 |           |           |\n| Total excluding AVTOVAZ     | 2,196,010 | 2,283,403 | 3,089,782 |\n| Total including AVTOVAZ     | 3,338,426 | 3,126,052 | 4,929,869 |\n\nWithin the 10 major countries, training hours carried out in 2021 broke down as follows:\n\n## Breakdown of training hours in the 10 major countries\n\nRussia\n\nRussia\n\n| Training/ country   | Argentina   | Brazil   | South Korea   | Spain   | France   | India   | Morocco   | Romania   | (including AVTOVAZ)   | (excluding AVTOVAZ)   | Turkey   |\n|---------------------|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Total hours 2016    | 45,400      | 71,538   | 118,164       | 641,874 | 844,738  | 158,277 | 118,621   | 465,297   |                       | 97,998                | 379,383  |\n| Total hours 2017    | 40,459      | 65,271   | 113,246       | 649,328 | 998,064  | 210,494 | 131,912   | 432,594   |                       | 128,996               | 343,632  |\n| Total hours 2018    | 78,522      | 95,564   | 100,549       | 636,649 | 948,324  | 194,636 | 175,434   | 418,138   | 1,751,056             | 158,617               | 344,705  |\n| Total hours 2019    | 50,651      | 55,185   | 73,846        | 587,146 | 939,094  | 113,505 | 172,724   | 278,388   | 1,964,076             | 123,989               | 304,854  |\n| Total hours 2020    | 36,549      | 66,743   | 67,231        | 509,790 | 569,830  | 192,659 | 99,232    | 203,077   | 904,080               | 61,431                | 263,518  |\n| Total 2021 hours    | 36,762      | 90,263   | 25,466        | 403,421 | 623,725  | 155,395 | 99,944    | 212,784   | 1,200,926             | 58,510                | 274,321  |\n\nOverall, the number of training hours increased worldwide in  2021.  However,  this  increase  covers  different  realities. The  decrease  in  the  number  of  training  hours  in  some countries is due to the continuation of the pandemic and the impossibility of organising a large number of in class training  sessions  in  2021.  Where  in  class  sessions  were possible,  health  measures  required  us  to  reduce  the number of participants in each session.\n\nThe development of distance-learning courses continued in conjunction with the increase in teleworking. The rise in digital  learning  was  confirmed  with  a  total  number  of hours  of  digital  training  of  352,035  for  the  Group (343,847 hours in 2020).\n\nAVTOVAZ training hours rose sharply to a total of 1,142,416 (842,649  in  2020)  despite  the  difficulties  encountered  in organising in class training.\n\nI",

The average training time (excluding AVTOVAZ) was 18 hours per employee (20.3 hours including AVTOVAZ).\n\nThese  indicators  are  monitored  on  a  monthly  basis  within the  major  entities  of  the  Group's  10  main  countries, representing  91%  of  Renault  Group's  registered  workforce. The  training  access  rate  in  these  10  major  countries (excluding AVTOVAZ) was 82.6% (72.1% including AVTOVAZ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A. Preparing tomorrow's leaders\n\nThe  Human  Resources  function  regularly  adjusts  the personal  development  policies  and  practices  for  the Company's men and women to enable them to adapt to the  new  challenges  faced  by  Renault  Group  and  to support  the  implementation  of  Group  strategy.  More generally,  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  process  of identifying  and  developing  talent  is  robust,  Renault Group  has  rolled  out  specific,  proactive  guidelines  for each country:\n\n- \u25cf spot  talent  as  early  as  possible,  take  risks  and strengthen development actions;\n- \u25cf increase  managers'  involvement  and  empowerment in talent development;\n- \u25cf maintain efforts to promote diversity of profiles.\n\nThese guidelines, shared across all jobs worldwide, aim to  identify  three  levels  of  potential  pools  for  filling different  levels  of  positions  of  responsibility,  with  the objective  of  promoting  equal  opportunities  and  taking diversity into account to prepare the Group's future.\n\nRenault Group is thus committed to widening its cultural diversity. To manage this initiative, the HR function has set itself the objective that 30% of key position holders should be non-French, compared with 26.5% in 2019. This indicator  is  also  monitored  in  the  Diversity  &  Inclusion scorecard redefined in 2020.\n\nIn  addition,  the  HR  function  and  management  are working  together  to  build  a  development  plan  for  the potential  of  these  future  leaders  to  ensure  their advancement.\n\n## Renault leadership assessment\n\nAnother  tool  used  to  detect  talent  in  addition  to  the sustainable  performance  assessments  and  individual appraisals is the Renault Leadership Assessment (RLA). This  development  tool  is  based  on  seven  leadership criteria  in  accordance  with  our  standard.  The  RLA  is conducted with a specialized consulting firm. The results are  used  to  assist  the  Career  Committees  responsible for  approving  decisions  regarding  Renault's  talent  by providing  objective  and  fair  information  to  be  used  in assessing potential candidates.\n\nMoreover,  these  results  enable  employees'  strengths and  areas  for  progress  to  be  identified.  The  individual results  produced  from  the  RLA  are  shared  with  the employee in question, and used to draw up an individual development  plan,  which  might  consist  of  several elements, such as:\n\n- \u25cf complete  training  programs  like  those  of  business schools;\n- \u25cf training programs that enhance specific skills, both in terms of knowledge (finance, international negotiation, etc.) and in terms of soft skills (e.g. Communication);\n- \u25cf career assessments;\n- \u25cf personal  coaching,  done  externally  or  internally,  to prepare  for  a  new  position  critical  for  Renault  or  to improve specific points (managerial stature, communication, etc.);\n- \u25cf mentoring  (learning  about  other  company  business activities, management  through  innovation,  peer relations, etc.);",

Contributing to the development and vitality of the territories EFPD14c\n\nRenault Group is a major player in the economic and social development of the territories in which it works. Present in 38  countries,  the  Company  considers  that  it  has  a responsibility to make sure that its impact on the regions where  it  is  located  is  positive  and  to  contribute  to  their sustainable  development.  The  Group's  ambition  is  to create  shared  value  for  the  mutual  benefit  of  the Company  and  all  of  its  stakeholders.  It  therefore  takes care to identify the requirements and expectations of the stakeholders that surround it (2.1.4) and to respond to them as far as possible through its core business and setting up innovative solutions.\n\n## 2.3.3.2. An active participant through its core business activities EFPD14b\n\nIt  is  difficult  to  truly  isolate  the  Company's  contributions within  a  complex  and  interdependent  socioeconomic tissue.  Beyond  direct  employment  generated  and  the taxes paid by the Company, the other direct and indirect contributions and  benefits  are  shared  among  the members of a network.\n\nAccording  to  the  figures  published  by  the  ACEA,  the association  of  European  automotive  manufacturers, 14.6 million  people  (representing  6.7%  of  the  active population)  work  in  the  European  automotive  sector (direct and indirect jobs - 2018 figures).\n\nThe number of direct jobs totaled 2.7 million (2018 figures). This  includes  automotive manufacturing, equipment and accessories,  and  coachbuilders.  Indirect  employment includes  other  manufacturing  fields,  vehicle  sales,  parts\n\nand accessories, maintenance, fuel, leasing and transportation, as well as construction and road maintenance and associated activities.\n\n## Renault Retail Group\n\nThe Humanitarian and Social Aid Fund (FASH) was created by Renault Retail Group in 2003: it arose from a collective agreement  signed  with  the  representative  labor  unions within RRG.\n\nThe  purpose  of  this  fund  is  to  grant  financial  aid  to  the employees  of  RRG  and  also  to  humanitarian  action associations.\n\nThe  FASH  continues  to  provide  help  and  support  for education,  health,  emergency  food  aid,  aid  to  regain mobility, disability and the environment.\n\n## 2.3.3.3. A global network of CSR correspondents\n\nThe Sustainable Development Department leads, coordinates and relies on a network of ESG correspondents in the main countries where the Group operates as well as on a newly created dedicated committee.\n\nThe 'Sustainable Development Committee' was created in  September  2021.  It  consists  of  representatives  from each of Renault Group's corporate functions and brands. Meeting  on  a  monthly  basis,  this  group  of  Sustainable Development correspondents aims to monitor and deploy the group's environmental, social, societal and governance commitments.\n\nAs soon as the new strategy was announced in April 2021 and  the  Sustainable  Development  Department  was created in June of the same year, these new environmental and societal commitments, integrated into the  Renaulution  strategic  plan,  were  communicated  and presented  to  all  the  Group's  correspondents  and  to  the main directors of the subsidiaries.\n\nI\n\n02",

Passing along knowledge for the future\n\nEducation  is  a  top  priority  within  Renault  Group's  CSR strategy.  Renault  Group  recognizes  that  providing training  on  the  careers  of  the  future  and  giving  the neediest access to knowledge are key to the development  of  society  and  also  of  the  Company. Renault therefore continues to deepen its commitments in this area.\n\n## 2.3.3.5. Bringing schools into the corporate world\n\nRenault  Group  is  committed  to  developing  talent throughout  life,  especially  among  young  people,  by helping  them  find  their  place  in  the  world  of  work. Renault  Group  develops  programs  and  initiatives  to forge  links  between  the  worlds  of  education  and employment,  and  to  professionalize  and  develop  their employability, with a particular focus on the promotion of diversity and equal opportunities.\n\n## A. In France...\n\nAs  was  the  case  in  2020,  2021  was  a  complex  year  for school relations due to the health crisis in France.\n\nDespite  this  context,  Renault  was  able  to  maintain  its links with schools and young people, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf as of the end of December, around 1,650 young people were  on  work-study  programs  in  France  (including 1,529  apprenticeship  contracts  and  75  CIFRE  training through  research  contracts).  As  part  of  the  '1  young person,  1  solution'  plan  and  its  commitment  to  young people,  Renault  Group  maintained  its  commitment  to take  on  5%  of  work-study  students  by  the  end  of December. Of the 1,529 apprentices present, 853 were recruited in 2021;\n- \u25cf by  hosting  804  young  people  in  internships  in  2021 (compared with 520 in 2020);",

Four projects were selected  by  the  juries  and  will  be  implemented  in  the Group's plants in the near future;\n- \u25cf by  providing  financial  support  to  126  educational institutions  and  approved  organizations  through  the apprenticeship tax.\n\n## B. ...but  also  in  other  countries  where  Renault  Group operates  EFPD14d\n\nMany  employees  spend  some  of  their  work  time  teaching classes  at  different  schools/universities.  These  activities  are organized  either  through  official  partnerships  or  at  schools and universities in countries where Renault Group operates.\n\nIn partnership with the local university, Renault Argentina is developing workshops, run by company employees and aimed  at  the  local  community,  to  strengthen  skills  and enable better professional reintegration. These workshops help them prepare for job interviews, look for a job, etc. In 2021, more than 1,700 people participated in 18 workshops, held online due to the health crisis:\n\nRenault Argentina Foundation is particularly active in this area:\n\n- \u25cf it grants scholarships to students attending the technical institute located near the plant. In recent years, more than 800 scholarships have been awarded;\n- \u25cf in  partnership  with  Fundaci\u00f3n  S\u00ed,  a  nationwide  NGO working  for  the  inclusion  of  vulnerable  populations,  it supports the University residence program, which grants four scholarships to underprivileged students to enable them  to  attend  university.  Since  2019,  16  scholarships have  been  awarded.  In  2021,  Renault  Argentina  lent  a Duster  to  this  NGO  to  enable  it  to  travel  around  the country, visiting schools that are difficult to access and identifying students in fragile situations;\n- \u25cf in partnership with the Education Department of the city of  Buenos  Aires  and  with  the  support  of  Renault Academy,  it  participates  in  the  Professional  Practices program  and  organizes  workshops  and  training  for students  and  teachers  on  car  repair,  electric  cars  and garage  management.  In  2021,  35  technical  education institutions participated in this program;\n- \u25cf Renault  Foundation  Colombia continues  to  provide support  to  30  underprivileged  engineering  students through its 'Renault German Camilo Calle' program;\n- \u25cf in Romania , Renault  Group  has  partnerships  with  15 universities. The Group also supports vocational training and  has  been  involved  in  the  development  of  future generations  of  automotive  specialists  since  2014.  The Group awarded more than 600 scholarships in 2021. 133 for  students  on  internships  in  the  Group's  entities,  11 excellence scholarships for students at the University of Pitesti, 321 scholarships for students at the technological high schools in Mioveni and Pitesti, and 80 scholarships for  students  from  two  high  schools  participating  in  a project with European funds.\n\nRenault Foundation Spain has also signed several agreements and is  involved  in  various  activities.  Through  its 'Renault  Graduates'  program,  Renault  Spain  is  a  partner  of universities  in  the  Castilla  y  Le\u00f3n  region  and  offers  training and  internships  to  20  young  graduates.    Renault  Spain  has awarded  two  projects  related  to  sustainable  mobility.  Five hundred internships took place in group companies in Spain thanks to an agreement signed with schools, universities and vocational training centers.\n\nWell  aware  that  knowledge  is  acquired  by  the  practical application of academic knowledge, Renault Group made numerous  gifts  of  vehicles  and  tools  to  schools  for educational purposes:\n\n- \u25cf in France , many  site make  such  donations  for educational  purposes  to  high  school  students  in  the areas where they are located;\n- \u25cf in Argentina ,  Renault donates test vehicles to technical institutions  to  be  used  for  student  training.  Since  the beginning of the program, more than 100 vehicles have been donated to institutions in the provinces of Buenos Aires and  Cordoba.  This  action  has  a  threefold economic, environmental and social impact. The destruction of  test  vehicles  is  avoided,  final  disposal  of waste  is  avoided,  and  it  contributes  to  the  training  of future automotive industry employees;\n- \u25cf in Spain ,  Renault Group regularly donates engines, gearboxes and  vehicles  to  educational  centres.  The  company  also donates  used  IT  equipment,  mainly  computers  and  office furniture, to schools and training centers.\n\nTeacher training and leadership development , to give them the means to transform their institutions, inspire and bring about change among young people, are further challenges for the company as great as that of training students:\n\n- \u25cf Renault  Foundation  Argentina ,  in  partnership  with  the NGO  Fundaci\u00f3n  Cordoba  Mejora  and  the  Renault Technology  America  (RTA)  Department,  is  supporting the Leaders in Education program for secondary school principals in the province of Cordoba. This program aims to improve the quality of education, reduce the number of school drop-outs and promote equal opportunities for young people through leadership development strategies.  This  program  was  suspended  in  2020  and 2021 due to the health crisis but will resume afterwards.\n- \u25cf Renault Foundation Colombia is continuing its collaboration with the Empresarios por la Educacion Foundation to train 20 school principals in Envigado (the city where the Renault Group  plant  is  located).  This  program  goes  by  the  name 'Rectores lideres transformadores'.\n\nI\n\n02",

Supporting access to education throughout the world EFPD14d\n\nRenault  Group  conducts  a  large  number  of  CSR initiatives  designed  to  promote  inclusion,  access  to education and fight against student drop-out:\n\nas such, the Douai plant (France) and its local partners in the  fields  of  employment,  vocational  training  and  social services have been working together since 1999 and have already helped more than 1,500 people obtain a degree. Each  year,  a  New  Skills  class  starts  preparing  for  a qualification  as  part  of  a  professionalization  contract. With  the  Fondation  Renault,  the  Douai  plant  has supported  the  Lens  automotive  production  school  from the outset. Its support comes in the form of visits and the donation of an ESPACE, but it also includes sponsorship: Renault  Group's  Regional  External  Affairs  Manager  is sponsoring  the  second  class  going  through  the  school. The production school is a private technical school that prepares  pupils  for  CAP  and  bac  pro  diplomas  and certifications. The three Renault electriCity manufacturers  took  part  in  DuoDay,  a  day  of  exchange between  an  employee  and  a  person  with  disabilities.  In total, ten duos were trained in our plants. DuoDay is part of Renault Group's inclusion policy.\n\nAlpine is launching a new challenge through the Alpine Mechanical Excellence Competition by organizing three events  dedicated  to  automotive  mechanics. Sponsored by  Esteban  Ocon,  driver  of  the  Alpine  F1  Team,  this competition  gives  students  (high  school  students, apprentices, advanced student or professional technicians,  etc.)  in  the  automotive  mechanics  section from all  over  France  the  opportunity  to  showcase their skills and know-how.\n\nFor its part, Renault Argentina supported various NGOs in 2021 through a community program designed to help more than 400 families from a disadvantaged area near the plant. The aim is to help these families develop their own  businesses.  The  NGO  'Las  Omas'  organizes  a sewing  workshop  where  more  than  15  women  are trained. The NGO 'Innovar Sustentabilidad' is organizing a business management workshop to enable these  women  to  earn  a  living  using  the  new  skills  that they learned in the previous workshop.\n\n- In Brazil , 'Renault  Experience',  an  innovation  and entrepreneurship  program  organized  by  the  Renault Institute, continued into its thirteenth consecutive year. The  program  is  aimed  at  students  wishing  to  create start-ups.  Candidates  whose  applications  are  selected by  the  Institute  benefit  from  a  year's  support  for  their project.  On  top  of  financial  support,  the  winners  are mentored  by  people  from  Renault  and  the  broader automotive  world  and  universities,  who  give  them advice throughout the year. For more information, go to: http://institutorenault.com.br\n\nFuture  Generation  is  another  important  vocational training  program  targeting  young  people  in  socially vulnerable  situations  in Brazil . This  free  six-month\n\ntraining course, intended for young people aged 15 to 24 who are still  enrolled  in  secondary  school  or  who  have completed their schooling, is designed to prepare them for  entry  into  the  labor  market.  It  includes  courses  in computer  science,  management,  citizenship,  behavior and civics. In 2021, courses were still held remotely due to the  health  crisis.  A  total  of  95  young  people  have graduated since the first class. Of the 95 students, 61% have found jobs or are doing internships at Renault do Brasil or other  companies  in  the  region,  despite unfavorable health and economic conditions;\n\nRenault  Foundation  Morocco contributes  to  improving school  conditions  in  the  regions  where  the  Group operates.  It  encourages  the  schooling  of  children,  in particular girls, and is fighting to reduce school drop-out rates in rural areas through the supply of school buses. In 2021,  2,100  pupils  benefited  from  the  school  transport service  every  day.  In  addition,  the  Foundation  has enabled  the  opening  of  four  pre-school  classes  in  the province of Fahs Anjra, which has accommodated more than 100 children from the region each year since 2018. A new school in a rural area was also renovated.\n\nThe  educational  approach  was  continued  in  2021  with the  deployment  of  the  Bibliobus  project  to  effectively support  schoolchildren  and  give  them  access  to reading, with particular attention paid to young schoolchildren with learning difficulties in the Casablanca region.\n\nThe  Foundation  introduced  a  new  initiative  to  support training  leading  to  a  diploma  as  part  of  a  training  and employability  program  for  young  people  who  are  not employed.\n\nIn  partnership  with  the  organization  'AlJisr',  30  young people  over  18  are  now  being  supported  in  the framework of a program for IT training and integration into employment in companies.\n\nAt the same time, the scholarship program for deserving baccalaureate holders in the municipality of Melloussa in Tangier welcomed three new beneficiaries this year.\n\nThe Renault Maroc Foundation is  also  very involved in the prevention of road risks. With the Tkayes school initiative, more  than  10,000  children  and  their  families  benefited from the road safety education program in 2021.\n\nIn Spain ,  various  initiatives  have been developed to help vulnerable  people.  In  Seville,  a  partnership  with  the 'Integra'  foundation  offers  an  inclusion  program  for vulnerable women. The 'Fundaci\u00f3n Exit' offers coaching to young people at risk of exclusion. This activity is taught by volunteer employees of the plant. Various agreements with  associations  such  as  'Afanias'  or  'Insolab'  offer courses for people with disabilities.\n\nRenault  Spain is a  member  of  the  'CEOs  POR  LA DIVERSIDAD' alliance, which brings together the CEOs of Spain's most important companies and aims to stimulate innovation in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nRenault  Foundation  Romania offered  11  'Constantin Stroe'  scholarships  for  the  2021  school  year.  It  also donated  200  tablets  to  children  from  disadvantaged backgrounds  so  that  they  can  continue  their  studies",

The Foundation is supporting an NGO to develop an environmental  handbook  containing  information  on environmental protection. Develop the teams to adapt to tomorrow's challenges\n\nTraining and skills management are the essential drivers for  supporting  the  Group  in  achieving  its  objectives.  The Company  has  two  main  objectives:  on  the  one  hand,  to adapt its skills to develop its competitive advantage and still  better  serve  its  customers,  and  on  the  other,  to promote development through training in new technologies, notably digital.\n\n## A. Prospective Skills Management (GPEC)\n\nAnticipating  the  impact  of  changes  related  to  our environment  on  our  skills  is  at  the  core  of  our  concerns. Renault Group is leading an initiative, known as Strategic Skills  Management,  to  identify  new,  stable  or  declining skills,  as  well  as  those  to  be  strengthened.  Under  the coordination of the HR teams, an analysis is produced by experts in the various jobs from the Company's corporate functions, and compared with external benchmarks. The priorities that  emerge  constitute  working  guidelines available  to  operational  staff  so  that  they  can  integrate these trends to define their areas of criticality and action plans.\n\nIn a period of turbulence, this forward-looking work, used to prioritize recruitment and build training plans, facilitates  the  identification  of  skills  to  be  preserved  or transformed.\n\n## In France\n\nThe  transformation  of  skills  initiated  several  years  ago accelerated in 2020 in a context of health and economic crisis.\n\nIn  France,  a  method  agreement  was  signed  on  July  24, 2020,  by  the  CFDT,  FO  and  CFE/CGC  labor  unions.  This agreement defined the framework, themes and timetable for social dialog relating to the implementation in France of several projects, including changes in employment and technical and tertiary skills.\n\nIn  order  to  deepen  the  joint  reflection  on  this  work,  job observatories  were  set  up  for  14  corporate  functions: product  engineering,  production  engineering,  logistics, sales and  marketing,  information  technologies  and systems, finance, purchasing, after-sales, product program, quality, communication, design, Human Resources  and  real  estate  and  facility  management. These  observatories  have  enabled  in-depth  study  of  the changes  forecast  in  the  various  jobs,  as  well  as  the possible  impacts  in  terms  of  employment,  skills  and qualifications. The Strategic Skills Management methodology has been reused and refined. In addition to categorization  by  type  of  skills,  declining,  stable  or needing strengthening, the availability of resources in the labor market was also considered (high, medium, scarce). Each  job  profile  was  then  positioned  on  this  mapping according  to  these  two  axes.  This  information  was  fed through  each  of  the  local  establishments  concerned  to the employee representative bodies (IRPs), management and employees.\n\nFollowing this cycle of joint discussions, an agreement on the 'Transformation of skills in the corporate functions of Renaults  s.a.s.'  was  signed  on  November  20,  2020,  by three labor unions  (FO, CFE-CGC  and  CFDT).  This agreement  covers  the  strengthening  of  technical  and tertiary  skills  as  well  as  arrangements  for  voluntary redundancies. Thus, a system of termination of employment  by  collective  agreement,  with  or  without mobility leave, has been set up for a limited scope defined by the job profile mapping. Employees with an eligible job profile,  who  have  a  professional  project  or  who  are retiring,  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  this  scheme  until September 30, 2021. In addition, a new activity exemption plan started on February 1, 2021.\n\nNew training courses will be set up to enable employees to upgrade their skills or change jobs. 400 employees will be able to benefit from a professional retraining program in 2021 and retraining opportunities will be boosted by a new internal mobility scheme. Some 250 strategic recruitments  are  also  planned  to  strengthen  our  teams with skills that cannot be developed internally.\n\nI\n\n02",

Plants in transition\n\nWith  40  plants  worldwide,  Renault  Group  has  an industrial system resolutely focused on the future, ready to  meet  the  new  challenges  of  the  automotive  sector and  to  customer  expectations.  New  occupations,  new know-how,  new  tools\u2026  Industry  4.0  is  the  driver  for  a connected,  agile  and  competitive  plant,  which  places humans, i.e. all company employees, at the heart of the system.  Our  aim  is  to  ensure  the  satisfaction  of  our customers  by  manufacturing  and  delivering  quality vehicles within the announced time frames.\n\n## 2.3.3.8. Digital transformation\n\nThe automotive sector is undergoing rapid change with the  ramp-up  of  electric  vehicles,  the  arrival  of  the autonomous and connected vehicle, customization, etc. To  meet  this  revolution,  the  automotive  industry  must adapt to ensure the reliability and full traceability of its production to ensure its competitiveness.\n\nRenault Group chose to digitalize its industrial system to support all employees, manufacture connected, customized vehicles and reinforce the customer's place in  the  plant.  Through  this  approach,  the  Company  has two aims: guarantee vehicle quality and the competitiveness of its plants.\n\nA wide variety of digital and mobile tools are in place to simplify the daily life of employees, enabling them to do their work, learn about the life of the company or carry out everyday tasks under the best possible conditions:\n\n- \u25cf real-time  monitoring  of  plants  and  the  supply  chain makes the production tool even more efficient;\n- \u25cf technologies  are  used  to  ensure  total  traceability  of parts and significantly accelerate logistics flows;\n- \u25cf numerous innovations are implemented in production engineering,  from  digital  design  to  prototyping  and digital  project  reviews,  in  order  to  set  up  a  flexible industrial system with controlled costs.\n\n## 2.3.3.9. Men and women at the heart of the plants\n\nThe  Industry  teams  include  nearly  98,000  employees worldwide. More agile, more reactive and trained in new technologies,  employees  focus  on  the  highest-value added  interventions  and  take  advantage  of  these innovations  to  be  relieved  of  certain  operations.  They exercise  fewer  arduous  tasks,  with  these  gradually being removed.\n\nWith the aim of accelerating the digitalization of Renault Group's industrial system and the roll-out of Industry 4.0, on  July  9,  2020,  Renault  Group  and  Google  Cloud announced  a  partnership  to  share  their  industrial  and\n\ntechnological experience. Renault Group's know-how in automotive  manufacturing,  combined  with  Google Cloud's  expertise  in  smart  analytics,  machine  learning and artificial intelligence, will foster the creation of new industrial solutions.\n\nThe two companies are also jointly setting up a training program aimed at developing the skills of Renault Group employees in the digital environment.\n\n## 2.3.3.10. Transforming our ecosystem to generate value creation\n\nTwo  major  strategic  projects  are  at  the  heart  of industrial Renewal:\n\n## Re-Factory: an unprecedented project in industry\n\nIn November  2020,  Renault  Group  announced  the transformation  of  its  site  in  Flins  to  create  the  ReFactory, Europe's first circular economy  factory dedicated to mobility, with the target of a negative CO2 balance  by  2030  (see  also  2.2.3.B  'Resources  and  the circular economy').\n\nThis project, which is part of its transformation strategy, will  enable  Renault  Group  to  benefit  from  a  rapidly growing source of value while  reaffirming  its  industrial footprint  in  France.  The  Re-Factory  will  house  the refurbishment  activities  of  Choisy-le-Roi,  and  support and  training  measures  for  Flins  and  Choisy-le-Roi employees will be set up to develop their skills.\n\nRe-Factory  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  sustainable development  strategy.  It  is  a  global  industrial  project intended  to  be  deployed  more  widely,  as  was  done  in November  2021  at  the  Seville  plant  in  Spain.  These activities contribute, on their own  scale, to the decarbonization trajectory to aim for carbon neutrality in Europe in 2040.\n\n## Renault ElectriCity, the new industrial hub and leader in northern France\n\nAn extraordinary human and industrial adventure began in Hauts-de-France. Less than six months after Luca de Meo  announced  the  creation  of  a  major  electrical  hub during  the  presentation  of  the  Renaulution  strategic plan,  the  Group  and  the  trade  unions  signed  the agreement validating  the  transformation  of  the  Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz sites.\n\nThis  major  industrial  project,  Renault  ElectriCity,  not  only aims to produce 400,000 electric vehicles per year by 2025, but  also  to  bring  together  a  complete  ecosystem  of suppliers  and  enable  Renault  Group  and  its  brands  to innovate and reduce many costs for greater competitiveness.",

Contributors and bodies\n\nThe Group's Director of Audit, Risks, Ethics and Compliance  (DAREC),  a  member  of  the  Corporate Management  Committee  (CMC),  is  responsible  for  the ethics and  compliance  system.  The  DAREC  meets regularly with the CEO to discuss its deployment.\n\nThe DAREC reports on ethics and compliance actions to the  Audit  and  Risk  Committee  (CAR),  a  specialized committee of the Group's Board of Directors.\n\nThe duties of the DAREC are as follows:\n\n- \u25cf define the Group's overall ethics and compliance policy;\n- \u25cf act as an adviser to the Company's management teams;\n- \u25cf ensure  that  whistleblowing  reports  are  collected  and handled;\n- \u25cf coordinate the Group Ethics and Compliance Committee (CECG);\n- \u25cf verify the ethical and compliance policy implementation in  the  Group's  various  business  activities  (purchasing, manufacturing, sales, engineering, finance, HR, etc.);\n- \u25cf reinforce the Group's ethics and compliance policy;\n- \u25cf deploy  the  Group's  ethics  and  compliance  policy  on  a global scale.\n\nTo complete this mission, the DAREC relies on:\n\n- \u25cf a team of around 15 employees;\n- \u25cf ethics and compliance correspondents appointed in all countries  where  the  Group  operates.

Highlights of 2021\n\nIn  2020,  Renault  underwent  an  audit  of  its  system  for preventing and detecting corruption and influence peddling  by  the  French  Anti-Corruption  Agency  (AFA) under  Article  17  of  the  'Sapin  II'  law  of  December  9,  2016. The AFA sent its provisional report in the summer of 2021, which  was  followed  by  a  procedure  between  the  two parties,  at  the  end  of  which  Renault  Group  submitted  its written  observations,  which  will  be  analyzed  by  the  AFA before it issues its final report. Renault Group received this final  report  on  February  9,  2022,  and  is  currently implementing  action  plans  to  address  the  auditors' recommendations and observations.\n\nThe  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  Department  is  now split into three divisions: ethics & deployment, whistleblowing and compliance.\n\nAn  'Inspiring  Ethics'  seminar  on  'Ethical  benchmarks for the world after' was held in December 2021. It is part of a process  to  raise  awareness  of  ethics  and compliance  among  all  Group  employees.  The  topics addressed  this  year  by  four  speakers  were:  'telework, the importance of relationship quality', 'ethical issues of artificial  intelligence  and  connected  and  autonomous mobility' and sharing of experience with a French group comparable with ours, notably on the deployment of a prevention and anti-corruption system.\n\nA  questionnaire  on  practical  knowledge  of  the  ethics and compliance systems was sent to employees at the group level. The rate of correct answers was 82%.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  code  of  conduct  was  updated following the work of a cross-functional group.\n\nThe internal tools for promoting and disseminating our policy  were  modernized  to  provide  employees  with clearer, more accessible information.\n\n## Stabilization of the ethics and compliance network\n\nThis  network  of  89  people  is  necessary  to  improve  the effectiveness and  impact  of  the  Group  Ethics  and Compliance Department's actions. A total of 35 correspondents  cover  all  countries  where  the  Group operates. The brands and the functions are also covered by  two  and  fifteen  ethics  &  compliance  officers respectively.  The  correspondents  and  officers  are assisted by 37 deployment leaders.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Compliance Department leads the network  via  e-conferences,  newsletters  and  an  annual seminar.  In  a  context  of  significant  use  of  telework, health crisis and travel restrictions, continuous contact with this network has been maintained.\n\n## Deployment of the prevention of corruption and influence-peddling plan  EFPD16b\n\nPursuant  to  the  'Sapin  II'  law  of  December  9,  2016,  on transparency,  the  fight  against  corruption  and  the modernization of economic life, the Group continues to\n\nstrengthen  its  overall  system  for  preventing  and detecting corruption and influence-peddling. The actions undertaken include but are not limited to:\n\n- 1. a  renewed, increased commitment by the governing bodies to the prevention and detection of corruption, in particular through the affirmation of 'zero tolerance'  presented  in  the  preamble  of  the  new version of the anti-corruption code of conduct;\n- 2. an  update  in  2021  to  the  corruption  risk  mapping approved by the Board of Management (BOM) allows risks  to  be  identified,  assessed  and  prioritized.  It includes  in  particular  those  risks  inherent  to  its international  activities  or  links  with  third  parties.  The various risks mapped are then taken into consideration  when  adjusting  the  Group's  ethics  and compliance policy;\n- 3. an  update  to  the  anti-corruption  code  of  conduct  in 2021;\n- 4. the  Third-Party  Integrity  Management  Process  has been rolled out in the Group's main subsidiaries. The integration of this process into the DoA (Delegation of Authority) approval circuit has enabled the inclusion of  an  opinion  on  the  integrity  of  the  third  parties concerned in more than 350 decisions requiring it. For third  parties  at  risk,  the  overall  level  of  coverage remains above 90% despite an increase in the scope;\n- 5. employees  and  managers  have  access  to  online training on the prevention of corruption and influence peddling,  as  well  as  the  detailed  presentation  of  the Group's  prevention  plan.  In  2021,  more  than  2,590 employees  attended  this  training.  This  represents  a cumulative  total  of  44,768  employees,  representing 94%  of  the  registered  population  according  to  the position  held  in  the  company.  An  online  training module,  'Ethics  within  Renault  Group',  was  delivered to  29,609  employees.  The  'conflicts  of  interest'  elearning  course  launched  in  early  2021  was  taken  by 27,037 employees, representing 88% of the registered population;\n- 6. the global whistleblowing system, available in 14  languages,  is  operational  in  almost  all  countries and is supported by the local ethics and compliance officers. It allows Group employees as well as external and occasional employees and suppliers to activate alerts directly with the Group Ethics and Compliance function. In particular, it is accessible confidentially at any time via an external site from a computer, tablet or  smartphone,  whether  professional  or  personal. More  than  400  reports  were  recorded  worldwide  in 2021,  around  30%  of  which  were  confirmed  after investigation, primarily for illegal or unethical behavior, harassment and fraud;\n- 7. in 2021, the Group Ethics and Compliance Department continued to carry out a self-assessment on the rollout of the corruption prevention system in the Group's",

Eleven audits including a review of local implementation of the corruption prevention policy were conducted in 2021;\n\n- 8. dedicated  communication  campaigns  were  carried out, in particular on 'third-party assessment', 'whistleblowing' and 'anti-corruption code of practice'.\n\n## Compliance with laws, regulations and corporate rules\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations is a major objective of the  Group.  The  Group  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee (CECG) is responsible for monitoring these systems.\n\nThe Group  Ethics and  Compliance  Department  is responsible  for  overseeing  regulatory  compliance.  It  is responsible for ensuring that reliable systems are in place with the prescribing departments: Technical Regulations, Legal,  Environment,  etc.  The  Legal  Department  and  the Risk  Management  Department  provide  support  and assistance on this subject.\n\nThere  is  a  method  to  assess  existing  procedures, validated by the CECG. The Group Ethics and Compliance Department  applies  this  method  to  a  list  of  regulatory areas selected with the Legal Department. In parallel with this assessment, a rating of the seriousness of the risk of regulatory  non-compliance  is  established  with  each prescribing  department  (see  'Risk  factors',  chapter 1.5.2.4).\n\nThe  system  as  a  whole  is  managed  by  the  internal monitoring procedure for regulatory compliance.\n\n## 2.4.2 Strengthening the responsible purchasing approach in the supply chain EFPD15a EFPD15b EFPD17c EFPD17d EFPD18\n\nThe Group also extends its social, societal and environmental  responsibility  to  its  relationships  with suppliers. Renault  Group  implements  a  responsible purchasing policy along its entire supply chain.\n\nIn  order  to  do  this,  Renault  has  incorporated  compliance with  social  and  environmental  requirements  into  its supplier  selection  and  relations  standards.  'Responsible purchasing' assessment of suppliers is therefore included in the selection criteria, alongside quality, financial health, strategy and industrial and logistical capacities.\n\n## 2.4.2.1. A CSR-focused purchasing team DV3b\n\nFor  over  10  years,  Renault  Group  has  had  a  dedicated team to prevent serious infringements under the duty of vigilance  law.  The  team  reports  to  the  Purchasing Department and has the following objectives:\n\n- \u25cf ensuring that suppliers meet standards and comply with laws,  regulations  and  soft  laws  in  social  environmental and ethical  areas  (e.g.  the  law  on  the  duty  of  vigilance, Sapin II, traceability of conflict minerals or cobalt, OECD/ UN/ILO Guidelines, etc.);\n- \u25cf improving the identification and reduction of CSR risks in the supply chain;\n- \u25cf strengthening the extra-financial assessment of suppliers  (through  an  external  provider  and  its  online platform);\n- \u25cf managing external CSR supplier audits;\n- \u25cf monitoring the implementation of appropriate corrective actions by both direct and indirect suppliers;\n- \u25cf coordinating a network of officers within local Purchasing Departments.\n\nI\n\n02",

Responsible purchasing policies, cornerstone of the supplier relationship DV3b\n\nIn order to prevent serious infringements under the duty of vigilance, Renault Group relies on documents that set out  principles  of  responsible  contractual  relationships with suppliers:\n\n- \u25cf Renault-Nissan 'Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)' guidelines for suppliers (December  2015). Distributed to all Renault Group suppliers and subcontractors, this document summarizes the Group's CSR expectations of suppliers and subcontractors in matters of safety and quality, human and  labor  rights,  the  environment,  compliance  and non-disclosure  of  information.  The  Group  asks  its suppliers  and  subcontractors  to  commit  in  writing  to comply with these guidelines. They are also requested to use them with their own suppliers;\n- \u25cf Global  Framework  Agreement  on  social,  societal  and environmental  responsibility:  signed  on  July  2,  2013, with the IndustriALL Global Union and the Group Works Council (see 2.4.1.4). Under the terms set out in chapter 3, Renault  Group  undertakes  to  communicate  the Framework Agreement to its suppliers and subcontractors. It requests them  to  commit  to implementing the fundamental social rights mentioned in chapter 1 of the Framework Agreement in their  own  companies  and  encourages  them  to  do likewise with their own  suppliers. If necessary,\n- corrective  action  plans  are  put  in  place  with  the support of Renault Group;\n- \u25cf Renault  Green  Purchasing  Guidelines  (June  2018):  this document is distributed to all Renault Group suppliers and describes requirements in matters of environmental  management,  policies  on  chemicals and recycling;\n- \u25cf Renault  Group  policy  on  the  supply  of  cobalt  and minerals  from  conflict-affected  and  high-risk  areas (2019). This policy provides suppliers and their subcontractors  with  details  of  products  that  may contain such minerals, and the Group's expectations as regards human rights and child labor in the supply chain.\n\nThe  purchasing  function  also  has  a  dedicated  code  of practice  that  complements  the  code  of  ethics.  This document is available on the Group's intranet site. It is aimed at all managers and employees in the Purchasing Department  and  the  Alliance  Purchasing  Organization (APO)  and  at  anyone  who  is  in  contact  with  suppliers and/or  who  has  an  influence  on  purchasing  activities within Renault Group and/or for Renault Group. The code applies to all Renault Group purchasing processes and, in  particular,  to  compliance  with  Renault's  strategy,  to selecting  suppliers,  reviewing  performance  and,  more generally  speaking,  to  any  contact  or  communication with suppliers.\n\n## 2.4.2.3. Supplier risk mapping to identify, analyze and prioritize risks DV1b\n\nUnder the law on the duty of vigilance (paragraph 2.1.6), Renault Group uses in particular a mapping of the risks of  suppliers  with  whom  an  established  commercial relationship exists.\n\nIn terms  of  risks relating to human  rights  and fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety  of  persons, the environment, ethics and compliance, two areas have been singled out for analysis:\n\n- \u25cf risks relating to purchasing families;\n- \u25cf parts. The families of purchases have been classified according to risks;\n- \u25cf services.  The  families  of  purchases  have  been included in a nomenclature produced by an external\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nservice provider based on the criteria of the law on the duty of vigilance;\n\n- \u25cf country risks. The mapping used was produced by an external  service  provider  based  on  the  criteria  of  the law on the duty of vigilance.\n\nThe combination of these two risk factors has enabled supplier and subcontractor sites to be ordered according  to  four  levels  of  criticality:  'low',  'medium', 'high' and 'very high'.\n\nFor those parts production facilities or service provision entities representing the highest potential risks and that have never undergone a CSR assessment, or for which the CSR assessment is not at the required level, external companies carry out audits on the ground.\n\n## 2.4.2.4. Regular evaluation procedures for suppliers and subcontractors DV2b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo  regularly  evaluate  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors, Renault Group uses:\n\n- \u25cf purchasing processes which  incorporate  CSR  criteria into selecting suppliers and subcontractors to enter its panel but also for awarding new contracts;\n- \u25cf an  Internet  platform (through  an  external  solution)  to assess suppliers' and subcontractors' CSR policies and actions,  and  to  incorporate  the  CSR  performance  of suppliers into purchasing decisions.",

Thus,  the management  of  suppliers'  CSR  risk  is  integrated  into\n\noverall risk analysis, just as financial risk or strategic risk is integrated into overall risk analysis.\n\nIn 2021, the analysis and management of suppliers' CSR risks were stepped up on the panel of the top 200 parts suppliers (POE), covering 86% of the global POE purchasing amount.\n\n## 2.4.2.5. Actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious infringements DV3b\n\nIn the  context  of  mitigating  risks  and  prevent  serious infringements,  Renault  Group  has  commissioned  102  social, environmental  and  ethics  audits  of  supplier  sites  since  2018, performed  by  external  companies  in  six  countries:  Algeria, China, India, Romania, Russia and Turkey.\n\nSpecific  emphasis  was  given  to  the  monitoring  of corrective action plans put in place by the suppliers with\n\n## 2.4.2.6. Whistleblowing DV4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee paragraph 2.1.5, 'Whistleblowing'.\n\n## 2.4.2.7. System for monitoring the measures implemented and assessing their effectiveness DV5b\n\nRenault Group traditionally measures the CSR performance of its suppliers through four main criteria:\n\n- \u25cf percentage of direct purchase volume of parts covered by a CSR assessment;\n- \u25cf percentage  of  total  purchase  volume  of  parts  covered by a high or very high grade CSR assessment;\n- \u25cf number of parts suppliers subject to a CSR assessment;\n- \u25cf number of parts suppliers whose CSR score reflects high or very high performance.\n\nIn 2021, the CSR performance (Group level) of Renault Group's suppliers of the Top 200 parts (representing approximately 86% of the total purchasing) was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                        | Total 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Percentage of direct purchase volume covered by a CSR assessment  (1)                                  | 98%          |\n| Percentage of total purchase volume covered by a high or very high  grade CSR assessment (3 years) (2) | 92%          |\n| Number of direct supplier groups covered by a CSR assessment                                           | 190/200      |\n| Number of CSR supplier groups covered by a high or very high grade CSR  assessment (less than 3 years) | 167/200      |\n\n(1)  Percentage of direct supplier volume covered by a CSR assessment on the Top 200 parts: The indicator represents the percentage of direct purchase volume  on  the  Top  200  parts  for  which  a  valid  CSR  assessment  (EcoVadis  assessment  or  equivalent,  less  than  3  years)  of  the  supplier  is  identified. The 'Top 200 parts' refers to the Top 200 suppliers calculated on the basis of 2020 revenue.\n\n(2) Percentage of total purchase volume covered by a high or very high grade CSR assessment (3 years) on the Top 200 parts: The indicator represents the percentage of direct purchase volume on the Top 200 parts for which a valid CSR assessment of the supplier (EcoVadis assessment or equivalent, less than three  years)  with  more  than  45  points  out  of  100  is  identified  (EcoVadis  considers  that  suppliers  with  45  or  more  points  are  not  at  risk). The 'Top 200 parts' refers to the Top 200 suppliers calculated on the basis of 2020 revenue.\n\nNote: In 2021, the indicators were the subject of a new methodology with reporting on the Top 200. Consequently, Renault Group does not present historical data.\n\nMoreover, in 2021, the average performance of the supplier groups assessed in the Top 200 parts suppliers on the:\n\n- \u25cf 'Environment' was 61.8/100.\n- \u25cf 'Social & Human Rights' was 55.0/100.\n- \u25cf 'Ethics' was 51.0/100.\n- \u25cf 'Responsible  Purchasing'  (among  our  suppliers)  was 48.7/100.\n- \u25cf With an overall average of 51.6/100.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  lowest  scores,  with  mandatory  re-auditing  for  these suppliers.\n\nIn  2021,  Renault Group continued to monitor the progress of  corrective  actions  taken  by  suppliers  who  obtained insufficient  results  in  audits.  However,  the  coronavirus pandemic  has  had  many  consequences  on  follow-up activities,  including  the  cancellation  of  a  new  audit campaign.",

Specific work in the cobalt/electric batteries sector\n\nMapping of minerals and materials risks\n\nRenault  Group  is  particularly  vigilant  as  regards  to  the origin  of  certain  minerals  and  materials,  for  which  risk mapping is also carried out.\n\nIn  the  light  of  Renault  Group's  commitment  to  human rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  and  particularly  the fight against child labor in its supply chains of minerals and  materials  from  high-risk  countries,  Renault  Group works in priority since 2017 with the cobalt sector, as this mineral is used in electric batteries.\n\nThe Group selected a specialist audit firm in this sector to fully map its supply chain and perform on-site audits for the identified stakeholders.\n\nSpecific actions to mitigate risks and prevent claims\n\nIn  2019,  this  specialist  firm  carried  out  17  site  audits  for certain  suppliers  and  subcontractors  in  the  cobalt supply chain. Audits were conducted at each level of the supply chain, starting with cathode suppliers and even down  to  some  small-scale  mines  in  the  Democratic Republic  of  the  Congo  (DRC).  No  critical  cases  of  noncompliance were identified, and corrective action plans are being implemented. In 2020, the monitoring of action\n\nplans by cathode  suppliers and  certain refiners continued.\n\nBased on the lessons learned from the audit campaign, Renault is updating its risk mapping starting from 2021.\n\nSince  2021,  Renault  has  also  set  up  working  groups  to rebuild  its  approach  to  risk  management  and  audits. These actions will continue in 2022.\n\nIn addition to these actions, Renault Group also initiated a  strategy  of  direct  partnership  with  key  raw  material suppliers for its battery supply chain in 2021.\n\nFor  example,  Renault  Group  announced  a  partnership with  VULCAN  Energy  in  2021  to  source  lithium.  This partnership represents a new step in the development of a more sustainable and transparent battery value chain in Europe.\n\nRenault has been a member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) since 2017. The RMI's objective is to strive to  implement  a  responsible  supply  chain  for  minerals and  materials  originating  from  Conflict  Affected  and High-Risk  Areas  (CAHRAs).  RMI  brings  together  the major  players  of  the  electronics  and  automotive industries.  It  meets  monthly  and  the  minutes  of  these meetings are sent to all of its members.\n\n## 2.4.2.9. Purchasing contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the supply chain\n\nSee section 2.2.2.1, 'Climate and energy efficiency'\n\n## 2.4.2.10. A local integration strategy EFPD14a\n\nLocal integration is a major element of Renault Group's purchasing  policy  because  it  can  improve  the  Group's competitiveness,  reduce  its  exposure  to  monetary fluctuations  and  contribute  to  the  development  of  the regions where it is located.\n\nA local approach has numerous advantages leading to the  reduction  of  costs.  Thus,  the  local  purchasing  of parts  can  reduce  transport  and  customs  costs.  This proximity  also  enables  the  Company  to  be  more responsive, to adapt more quickly to changes in demand from its customers and to participate in local development and notably the local employment pool.\n\nTo promote local integration, Renault Group has created dedicated  teams,  firstly  in  Russia,  then  in  Brazil  and India. These teams, from purchasing, engineering, sales costs  and  logistics,  launch  local  calls  for  tenders  to purchase parts that until then were imported.\n\nThe localization rate is intrinsically connected with local regulations,  currency  exchange  rates,  the  Group's industrial  activity  (launching  of  new  projects)  and  may vary on a year-to-year basis.",

In  all  countries  where  it  is  established,  Renault  Group ensures  compliance  with  tax  rules  applicable  to  its activity,  in  accordance  with  international  conventions and local laws.\n- 2. In its relations with tax authorities, Renault Group aims at strictly complying with tax procedures and endeavors  to  maintain  good  relations  in  order  to maintain  its  reputation.  Renault  Group  endeavors  to create a lasting, transparent and professional relationship  of  trust  with  tax  authorities  of  different countries  and  opts  for  special  partnership  programs with the tax authorities whenever possible.\n- 3. Renault  Group  does  not  encourage  or  promote  tax evasion for itself or for its subsidiaries.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. Implementation of tax policy\n\nRenault  Group's  Tax  Department  is  responsible  for  the Group's tax policy worldwide, including the management of all tax-related risks.\n\nRenault  Group's  Tax  Department,  as  a  support  function attached to the Group Finance Department, is independent of the operational functions. It is supported by a local tax network in its mission.\n\nTax  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's overall risk management process.\n\nSustainable development\n\n- 4. Renault  Group  applies  OECD  principles  for  transfer pricing,  and  intra-Group  transactions  comply  with  the arm's-length  principle.  When  local  constraints  require deviation from OECD  methodologies,  such  local constraints are documented.\n- 5. Renault Group is fully committed to the implementation of  regulations  aimed  at  ensuring  tax  transparency  at local, EU or international level.\n- 6. Given  the  complexity  of  tax  rules,  Renault  Group  may have  differences  of  interpretation  with  local  tax authorities.  It  then  reserves  the  right  to  contest  any adjustments that are deemed unfounded.\n\nThe Group Tax Department ensures the dissemination of tax  compliance standards within the group (Automotive, Sales  Financing  and  Mobility  Services)  through  internal communication channels.\n\nThe Group Tax Department takes a responsible approach to  managing  and  controlling  tax  matters,  based  on  the relevant  documentation  and  rigorous  internal  control  of tax processes.\n\n## 2.4.4 Cybersecurity and data protection\n\n## 2.4.4.1.

Personal data protection\n\nCompliance with personal data protection rules opens up a golden  opportunity  to  strengthen  trust  between  Renault s.a.s. and  its stakeholders  (shareholders, customers, suppliers  and  employees).  Trust  is  an  especially  strong value for Renault s.a.s., and personal data protection is one of the main ethical bases for our actions.\n\nGiven  this  commitment,  Renault  designated  a  data protection  officer  (CIL)  in  2011  to  the  French  data protection  authority  (CNIL)  with  an  extended  scope.\n\nmeasures  are  provided  in  chapter  1.5.2,  'Risks  related  to cross-group functions'.\n\nSubsequently,  the  Group  implemented  legal,  technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance with French  data  protection  law  No.  78-17  of  January  6, 1978. More recently, in May 2018, Renault Group appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) in order to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since June  2019,  this  has  been  a  full-time  role  performed  by  a dedicated  expert  who  leads  and  coordinates  actions  to ensure that all of the group's activities are compliant with these standards.\n\nI\n\n02",

Lifecycle Assessment\n\nRenault Group conducts lifecycle assessments in accordance  with  ISO  14040  and  ISO  14044.  Renault  uses the GaBi LCA (PE International) software and databases.\n\nThe lifecycle inventory describes all the elements that are taken  into  account  in  the  lifecycle  assessment  of  a vehicle.  These  data  are  related  to  lifecycle  stages,  from the vehicle's manufacturing to its recycling, and including its usage phase:\n\n- \u25cf raw  materials  and  manufacturing:  thanks  to  Renault's internal databases, each vehicle is described in terms of the  raw  materials  it  contains.  These  data,  coupled  with those  in  the  GaBi  database,  allow  all  phases  of  the extraction  and  processing  of  raw  materials  to  be incorporated in the inventory. The data on the manufacturing  of  vehicles  integrated  in  the  lifecycle inventory comes  from  the  annual  environmental reporting  for  the  industrial  sites,  which  is  subjected  to verification by an Independent Third Party;\n- \u25cf usage  and  maintenance  phase:  the  usage  phase  is calculated  over  10  years  and  150,000  km.  The  certified emissions  for  the  regulatory  cycle  are  taken  into consideration.  Moreover,  the  impacts  associated  with the  energy  consumption  of  vehicles  (diesel,  gasoline  or electricity)  are  calculated  from  'well  to  wheel',  i.e.,  the emissions associated with the production and transport of the energy used are taken into account. In the usage phase, the maintenance activities performed throughout  the  life  of  the  vehicle  (tire  changes,  oil changes, brake fluid, etc.) are taken into account;\n- \u25cf end-of-life: emissions related to recycling processes are accounted for. The recycling of materials from vehicles enables  the  use  of  virgin  material  and  associated emissions  to  be  avoided.  The  emissions  avoided  in  this way are deducted from the carbon footprint.\n\nAll potential impacts are calculated using the GaBi software.\n\n## B. Carbon footprint\n\nThe purpose of determining Renault's carbon footprint is to  measure  and  propel  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas emissions in Renault Group. The following methodologies have accordingly been chosen:\n\n- \u25cf the  carbon  footprint  is  compared  with  the  number  of vehicles sold;\n- \u25cf in the event of sales or acquisitions, the reference value (2010)  is  corrected  to  take  into  account  or  subtract  the site's  emissions  at  that  date  in  order  to  measure changes  in  the  Group's  carbon  footprint  in  relation  to 2010 on a comparable scope of activity;\n- \u25cf if there is an update to the model in the GaBi tool used to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the materials and parts purchased (see above), the 2010 reference value is recalculated with the new database in order  to  measure  the  changes  to  the  indicator  on  a comparable  basis.  This  happened  in  2015  and  2018.  In addition, to factor in the environmental performance of suppliers  between  model  updates  in  the  GaBi  tool,  a carbon performance factor of -2% per year is applied;\n- \u25cf the carbon footprint is calculated for a constant scope of emissions.  When  the  scope  is  amended,  the  2010 benchmark value is recalculated. In 2017, the calculation scope  was  extended  to  include:  RRG,  vehicles  bought from  and  sold  to  partners,  filling  of  air-conditioning systems (for premises and vehicles), vehicle and engine testing and indirect emissions linked to purchase thermal energy.  In  2018  two  foundries  were  integrated  into  the scope  without  recalculating  the  2010  benchmark  value, this being a capacity extension rather than an integration  of  a  pre-existing  entity.  In  2020,  vehicle  airconditioning maintenance was taken into account, with a recalculation of the 2010 reference value. The conversion factors between certification cycles were also updated.\n\nThe  carbon  footprint  for  Renault  does  not  include  a prospective dimension. The value retained for the carbon intensity  of  fuel  and  industrial  processes  is  that  of  the vehicle release year and does not vary during the lifecycle of the vehicle (10 years, 150,000 km).\n\nThe table below indicates the scope of emissions covered by  the  Renault  carbon  footprint  indicator  as  well  as  the origin  of  the  data  used  and  the  level  of  external verification  applied.  To  facilitate  understanding,  the categories of the Renault carbon footprint are matched to those of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nI\n\nSustainable development\n\n02",

Revenues from circular economy activities\n\nThis  indicator  is  calculated  by  totaling  2021  revenues regardless of Renault Group's stake in the capital.\n\n## Sum of:\n\n- \u25ba Re-Factory revenue;\n- \u25ba Choisy site revenue,\n- \u25ba Renault Environnement (GAIA, INDRA and Boone Comenor) revenue.\n\n## 2.5.1.3. Methodological comments on the table 'Site environmental indicators for 2021'\n\nReporting for the environmental indicators was conducted in accordance with the stipulations of the 2021 Environmental Protocol for Renault Sites. The following is an explanation of the main methodological choices of the Protocol.  This  Protocol  is  available  on  request  from  the Environment  Department  of  the  Group's  Health,  Safety, Environment and Ergonomics Division (DHSEE).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe  'scope'  of  the  reported  data  covers  the  industrial subsidiaries  (body  assembly,  final  assembly,  powertrain and foundry) and the support sites (product and process design,  logistics)  in  the  Renault  Group  financial  scope  of consolidation. Since 2021, this scope has fully covered the two AVTOVAZ sites in Togliatti and Izhevsk.\n\nNote:  the  AlpineF1  Team  sites  in  Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon  and Enstone  are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  environmental reporting, as the former produces engines exclusively for competition  vehicles  (Formula  1),  and  the  latter  designs and assembles these vehicles.\n\nImpacts of suppliers or third parties present on site are not included,  with  the  exception  of  the  sites  listed  under  the 'Site  environmental indicators in  2021'  table.  All  impacts arising  from  employee  catering  facilities,  CSR  activities and social  partner  activities  are  included  in  the  data  for the Renault sites.\n\nThe  data  for  sites  included  in  the  scope  of  reporting  in year Y are presented for information and are consolidated with those of other sites only from year Y+1.\n\nData from GAIA is taken into account at sites where GAIA operates,  except  the  Choisy-le-Roy  and  Flins  sites (France), where GAIA waste is recorded separately.\n\nThe  drinking  water  production  and  Davidesti  waste storage  activity  at  the  Pitesti  site  (Dacia)  as  well  as  the Gretz-Armainvilliers site are excluded from the reporting scope. The data is shown for information purposes.\n\n## Data control and consolidation procedures\n\nSpecialized  experts  from  the  Group  DHSEE  check  the consistency of data at each site. These checks include a comparison  with  data  from  previous  years  and  an analysis of the impact of events occurring on site during the year.\n\nThe  environmental  data  presented  in  the  Universal Registration  Document  have  also  been  subjected  to external  verification  by  the  independent  third  party, KPMG.  Their  conclusions  are  set  out  in  the  report  in section 2.5.6.\n\n## Vehicle production\n\nThe  vehicles  counted  are  those  that  have  gone  through the fall-off mechanical line manufacturing stage, which is standard  for  all  bodywork/assembly  plants.  From  this counting point, the vehicles leave the assembly line. They can  be  driven  and  are  considered  to  be  manufactured, even  if they have  to  be  reworked  and/or  tested afterwards.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nWater  consumption  is  expressed  in  thousands  of  cubic meters (m 3 ).\n\nMeasured  volumes  include  water  obtained  by  pumping (underground and surface water) and/or external networks  (drinking  water,  industrial  water).

Discharges  from  some  plants  may  subsequently  be treated in municipal treatment plants (see plant codes).\n\nUnder the Reporting Protocol, the frequency of discharge  analysis  must  comply  with  the  regulations applicable to the Renault sites.\n\nThe  quantity  of  COD  (Chemical  Oxygen  Demand) represents  the  flow  of  organic  pollutants  discharged. This quantity is expressed in metric tons per year.\n\nThe Zn+Ni quantity represents the sum of the zinc and nickel  flows  discharged.  This  quantity  is  expressed  in metric tons per year.\n\nThe data presented only take into account the discharges relating to metals and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), for which  concentration  and  flow  must  be  measured  by  law, and  the  discharges  from  the  plants  in  Bursa  (Turkey), Curitiba  (Brazil),  Moscou-Togliatti-Izhevsk  (Russia),  Santa Isabel  de  Cordoba  (Argentina)  and  Casablanca  (Morocco), for which voluntary controls are taken into account in light of the  significant  contribution  of  these  discharges  to  the Group's impacts.\n\nThe  Moscow,  Santa  Isabel  de  Cordoba,  Curitiba, Casablanca  (Somaca),  Batilly  (Sovab)  and  Togliatti (AVTOVAZ)  sites  are  subject  to  specific  regulatory requirements and receive an exemption  on  the calculation methodology of the specific flows.\n\nFor sites that are not subject to a regulatory requirement to  measure  pollutant  flows  or  to  consolidate  voluntary controls at the Group level, the reported value is noted as  'NC'.  Black  water  discharges,  for  which  there  is  no regulatory  measurement  and/or  reporting  obligation, are not included in the water discharges. This concerns 33% of manufacturing sites (one of which is covered in a partial statement) and 67% of engineering, logistics and support sites.\n\n## Air emissions\n\nGreenhouse  gas  (GHG)  discharges  include  the  direct and indirect GHG emissions and are expressed in metric tons of CO2 equivalent.\n\nDirect  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  are  derived from  an  inventory  of  GHG  sources  conducted  in  2004 and  updated  in  part  in  2021.  Following  this  inventory, Renault modified its guidelines to better reflect the total emissions  of  Renault  Group  and  to  comply  with  the recommendations  of  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol (GHG  Protocol)  and  the  French  protocol  developed  by Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EPE).\n\nEmissions from the following sources were included:\n\n- \u25cf combustion  of  fossil  energies  transported  to  the  site and those transformed by the site for third parties;\n- \u25cf coolant fill-up of the air-conditioning systems fitted in vehicles produced by the plant. Only HFC 134a fill-up is taken  into  account.  It  is  not  considered  pertinent  to declare  HFO1234yf  use  under  French  legislation (Article  R.  54375  of  the  French  Environment  Code excludes this gas from coolant fluids) and in view of its negligible  impact  on  GHG  emissions  fuel  combustion during  testing  of  engines,  gearboxes,  endurance vehicles and on roller benches;\n- \u25cf forklift trucks using compressed natural gas or propane;\n- \u25cf fuel consumption  relating  to  Renault's  company vehicles (taxi pools, shuttles, service vehicles, handling equipment, etc.);\n- \u25cf coolant leaks from fixed air conditioning systems and processes with a nominal load in excess of 5 teqCO2.\n\nThese emissions make up more than 95% of the direct GHG emissions produced by Renault Group.\n\nThe  following  emission  sources  have  been  excluded from  the  reporting  scope,  since  the  corresponding emissions are not significant (less than 1% of total direct GHG emissions):\n\n- \u25cf solvent incineration;\n- \u25cf tests on vehicles leaving the assembly line (test benches).\n\nIt is not  yet  possible  to  correctly  assess  certain emissions,  so  the  following  are  not  included  in  the reporting scope:\n\n- \u25cf emissions associated with transport on sites not listed above among the emissions counted (particularly the delivery by a road haulier external to Renault Group);\n- \u25cf fugitive  emissions  occurring  when  tanks  of  coolant  (for vehicle air conditioning systems) are filled and emptied;\n- \u25cf emissions linked to SF6-type circuit breaker installations.\n\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) indirect discharges are related to purchased  electricity, steam  and  hot  water.  The emission factors used for the 2021 reporting are:\n\n- \u25cf for electricity, those published directly by suppliers or, if  these  are  not  available,  those  published  by  the  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  in  its  publication  IEA (2021), Emission Factors;\n- \u25cf for steam and hot water, data calculated on the basis of information provided by suppliers.\n\nCertain  emissions  from  the  foundry  activity  are  not reported. However, emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the foundries are taken into account.\n\nEmissions  factors  used  in  the  calculations  of  SO2,  NOx and  GHG  emissions  are  taken  from  the  CITEPA's OMINEA  National  Inventory  Report  (updated  in  March 2021)  or  Regulation  (EU)  2018/2066  and  are  consistent with  the  recommendations  of  the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThe emission factor from fixed combustion installations of  low-NOx  natural  gas  burners  was  calculated  in  2011, based on an internal  study  of  88%  of  sites  in  the  scope having  low-NOx  burners.  The  factor  thus  obtained (0.0266kg/MWh  LHV)  is  the  average  of  the  factors obtained  at  each  site  weighted  by  the  power  of  the",

The application of paint on bumpers and on parts and accessories is not taken into account.\n\nThe  indicator  shown  corresponds  to  the  metric  tons  of VOC emissions and the ratio of VOC emissions per m 2 of painted  vehicle  surface.  The  consolidated  ratio  for  the Group corresponds to the total VOC emissions generated by  the  body  assembly  plants  divided  by  the  total  of  the painted surfaces.\n\nThe  atmospheric  emissions  of  SO2  and  NOx  counted represent  the  emissions  from  the  combustion  of  fossil energies  in  fixed  combustion  installations  at  all  sites, excluding on-site transport.\n\nSO2 and NOx emissions generated by engine tests are not taken into account, since the SO2 emissions are insignificant and NOx emissions are difficult to calculate (unreliable assessment method).\n\n## Waste\n\nThe  waste  reported  is  the  waste  that  leaves  the  site's geographical  scope;  the  quantities  are  expressed  in metric tons.\n\nConstruction  waste  from  Renault  sites  is  not  reported unless  a  contractual  clause  explicitly  states  that  the construction company is not responsible for it.\n\nThe waste reported includes hazardous waste (HW), nonhazardous waste (NHW), and construction site waste.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, non-hazardous waste is presented in two subcategories:\n\n- \u25cf metallic waste from production processes (scrap metals, machining chips, etc.);\n- \u25cf non-metallic waste (mixed ordinary waste, for example).\n\nFoundry waste is waste specifically related to the foundry process.  As  such,  mixed  non-hazardous  waste  produced by a foundry is not considered foundry waste.\n\nNon-recycled  waste  is  waste  for  which  the  treatment network is designated by European treatment codes D or R1 (energy recovery).\n\nRecovered  waste  is  all  waste  that  is  recycled  (material recovery)  or  incinerated  with  energy  recovery  (energy recovery, treatment code R1).\n\nWaste from the AVTOVAZ sites in Togliatti and Izhevsk for which  proof  of  treatment  is  not  available  or  not sufficiently accurate is considered landfill\n\n## Energy Consumption\n\nThis metric represents the quantity of gas, heating oil, LPG (excluding vehicles), biomass, steam, hot water, electricity and  solar  thermal  energy  consumed  at  Renault  sites, expressed  in  MWh  LHV  (Lower  Heating  Value).  However, the data indicated does not include the propane used by forklift trucks or the fuel consumed by the site (engine and gearbox testing, company vehicles).\n\nThe primary or converted energy supplied to third parties is  not  included.  The  purpose  of  the  energy  consumption indicators  is  to  reflect  the  energy  performance  of  the Group's manufacturing processes.\n\nThe LHVs are consistent with Regulation (EU) 2018/2066 on the monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions, with the exception of LHV of natural gas from the Spanish plants from the March 2021 (Spanish) national greenhouse gas  inventory  report.  The  LHVs  are  consistent  with  the emissions reported in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nI",

It collects part of the data for the entire scope and ensures the overall consistency of results;\n- \u25cf a questionnaire is sent to the Clusters. This questionnaire includes  a  number  of  indicators:  headcount  by  gender and  age,  number  of  recruitment  and  redundancies, absenteeism  rate,  number  and  subjects  of  major collective agreements signed during the year, number of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and  selected  at  corporate  level  from  the most  relevant  agreements,  total  cumulative  training hours in the year, training access rate, average training rate per employee  and  percentage  of  disabled employees. Each indicator has a specific definition and calculation  method  that  is  shared  with  each  of  the Clusters.  This  questionnaire  also  enables  data  to  be cross-referenced  with  last  year's  figures  to  monitor developments;\n- \u25cf for  the  data  specific  to  health  and  safety  (number  of occupational  accidents,  commuting  accidents  and occupational illnesses), a reporting process with monthly consolidation  is  put  in  place  with  the  Group  entities. Each month, the data is checked at the corporate level, using  the  protocol,  to  ensure  the  quality  of  their classification. A digital reporting tool is being rolled out, contributing to improving the reliability of data.\n\nA  continuous  improvement  process  for  these  collection methods is in place, taking into account the recommendations of the statutory auditors.\n\n## Definitions and calculation methods for labor-related indicators\n\nTotal  workforce: number  of  employees  holding  an employment contract with the entity (permanent or fixedterm). Every employee on the payroll is counted as 'one' regardless  of  his  or  her  contractual  working  time  (or activity  rate).  All  employees  on  the  payroll  are  counted, even if they are sent to another entity.\n\nAverage  Group  workforce  = (Group workforce at December  31  of  the  previous  year  +  Group  workforce  at December 31 of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage  country  workforce  = (country  workforce  at December 31 of the previous year + country workforce at December 31 of the current year)/2.\n\nAverage active workforce: the average active workforce is  equal  to  the  total  registered  workforce  for  the  entity concerned,  excluding  'inactive'  employees.  The  active workforce is measured every month. The  average  active  workforce  is  equal  to  the  average calculated over 12 months.\n\n'Inactive': persons  appearing  in  the  entity's  workforce but physically absent from the entity for a long period and paid  only  partially  or  not  at  all.  This  category  consists mainly  of  unworked  notice  periods,  leave  of  absence unpaid  for  various  reasons  including  long-term  parental leave,  sabbatical  leave,  end  of  professional  career  leave including  exemptions  from  activity  in  France,  leave  for business  creation,  parental  educational  leave,  absence due  to  long-term  illness  or  accident  after  using  up  the amount of leave paid by the Company (amount linked to the  current  work  absence),  and  military  service.  Persons on  sick  leave  (excluding  long-term)  and  on  maternity  or paternity leave are not considered as 'inactive' employees.\n\nNumber of Group redundancies: termination of permanent contract or early termination of fixed-term contract by the employer  for  one  or  more  reasons  that  may  or  may  not relate  personally  to  the  employee  in  question,  and  which may  be  either  collective  or  individual.  Conventional severance, voluntary departure plans, non-continuation at the end of a trial period, and abandonment of post are not considered as redundancy.\n\nNumber  of  Group  recruitments: hiring  on  permanent contract and fixed-term contracts.\n\nTop governing bodies: positions comprising members of the BoM (Board of Management), CMC (Corporate Management Committee) and BMC (Brand Management Committee).\n\nSenior  Management  Positions:  Positions  of  responsibility: positions reaching a certain level of responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology.  This represents 4,000 positions, within the scope deployed in the People@Renault tool (excluding AVTOVAZ and RRG).\n\nManagement Positions: positions of responsibility: positions reaching  a  certain  level  of  responsibility according to the Korn Ferry job evaluation methodology. This represents 10% of the Group's positions in the scope defined in the People@Renault tool (excluding AVTOVAZ and RRG), i.e. 11,000 positions.\n\nNumber of hours of training :  cumulative number of training hours  delivered,  whether  the  training  is  provided  on  site  by internal/external trainers, outside the company by a training organization, or followed remotely. This indicator measures the overall training effort.\n\nPercentage  of  training  access: Number  of  employees trained at least once during the year who are still with the Company at the end of the year as a percentage of the active workforce at year-end.\n\nAverage  training  hours  per  employee: total hours  of employee training carried out during the year for employees present at the end of the year, as a percentage of the active workforce at the end of the year.\n\nEmployment rate of people with disabilities: percentage of employees with disabilities in the total workforce as of December 31. It should be noted however, that it is difficult\n\nI\n\n02",

Rate  of  reported occupational  illness  per  1,000  employees  to  end-2016. Occupational  illness  rate  reported  per  million  hours  of exposure to occupational risks from 2017 onwards.

They  identify a minimum  set  of sustainable development themes and associated indicators  that  a  company  characteristic  of  an  industry segment should publish because of their materiality.\n\nThe  SASB  has  defined  five  themes  and  their  associated KPIs for the automotive industry.\n\n| Topic                                | Accounting measure

This  rates  the  Company  not  only  on  its  financial performance  but  also  on  its  attitude  toward  the environment, respect for social values, societal commitment and corporate governance.\n\nEach area analyzed produces a rating based on different criteria  (transparency,  innovation,  communication,  etc.) and is weighted to obtain a final rating. This serves as a reference for fund managers and investors who wish to invest  in  companies  which  are  successful  in  terms  of social responsibility. Some of these rating agencies have developed, most of the time in partnership with providers of equity indexes, some specific indexes composed of the top-rated companies  for environmental, social or governance (ESG) aspects.\n\nRenault  Group  is  evaluated  each  year  by  the  main international  extra-financial  rating  agencies  on  the basis  of  its  public  and  declarative  information.  These agencies generally reserve access to the results of their assessments  for  their  own  customers.  In  addition, Renault  is  included  in  the  composition  of  ESG  indexes, notably the MSCI World and Europe ESG family.\n\n## Extra-financial performance\n\nThe CDP (formerly  the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project), founded  in  2000,  is  tasked  by  a  group  of  institutional investors  to  enhance  understanding  of  the  impacts  of climate change on the value of the assets managed by its signatories.  It is an  independent  not-for-profit organization  which  collates  and  maintains  a  large database relating to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSince  2002,  the  CDP  has  sent  annual  requests  to companies for information in a standard format about their greenhouse gas emissions and policies on climate change. The CDP includes, in particular, members of the FT500  (the  500  largest  companies  in  the  world  by market capitalization).\n\nLatest  results  -  December  2021 For  more  information: www.cdp.net\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nISS-Corporate Solutions is  one of the largest sustainability ratings  agencies  in  the  world.

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the ethical requirements and French professional guidance of the Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes relating to this activity.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work was carried out by a team of eight people between November 2021 and February 2022 and took a total of around 30 weeks.\n\nWe  were  assisted  in  our  work  by  our  specialists  in  sustainable  development  and  corporate  social  responsibility.  We conducted some 15 interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Declaration.\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking into account the risks of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nIn our opinion, the procedures that we carried out using our professional judgment enable us to provide a moderate level of assurance:\n\n- \u25cf We  obtained  an  understanding  of  all  the  consolidated  entities'  activities  and  the  description  of  the  principal  risks associated;\n- \u25cf We  assessed  the  suitability  of  the  criteria  of  the  Guidelines  with  respect  to  their  relevance,  completeness,  reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices where appropriate.\n- \u25cf We verified that the Declaration includes each category of social and environmental information set out in Article L. 225-102-1III as well as information regarding respect for human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation.\n- \u25cf We verified that the Declaration provides the information required under Article R. 225-105-II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L. 225-102-1-III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code.\n- \u25cf We verified that the Declaration presents the business model and a description of principal risks associated with all the consolidated  entities'  activities,  including  where  relevant  and  proportionate,  the  risks  associated  with  their  business relationships,  their  products  or  services,  as  well  as  their  policies,  measures  and  the  outcomes  thereof,  including  key performance indicators associated to the principal risks.\n- \u25cf We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- \u25cf assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented; and\n- \u25cf corroborate  the  qualitative  information  (measures  and  outcomes)  that  we  considered  to  be  the  most  important presented in the notes. Concerning certain risks 2 ,  our  work  was  carried  out  on  the  consolidating  entity.  For  the  other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities 3 .\n- \u25cf We verified that the Declaration covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Declaration.\n- \u25cf We  obtained  an  understanding  of  internal  control  and  risk  management  procedures  the  entity  has  put  in  place  and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information.\n- \u25cf For  the  key  performance  indicators  and  other  quantitative  outcomes  that  we  considered  to  be  the  most  important presented in appendix, we implemented:\n- 1 ISAE 3000 (revised): international standard on assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information.\n- 2 Working environment; Human rights; Local development; Road safety; Personal data protection and cybersecurity; Anti-corruption; Supplier relations and procurement; Anti-tax evasion.\n- 3 Environmental indicators: Argentina (Cordoba Santa Isabel); France (Douai, Sandouville, Le Mans, Flins); Portugal (Aveiro CACIA); Romania (Dacia); Russia (Togliatti, Izhevsk); Slovenia (Novo Mesto); Turkey (Bursa).\n\nSocial indicators: Romania (Dacia); Russia (Togliatti).\n\nHealth and safety indicators: France (Parts and Accessories Logistics Department); Portugal (Aveiro CACIA); Russia (Togliatti, Izhevsk); Turkey (Bursa).\n\nI",

This  work  was  carried  out  on  a selection of contributing entities and covers between 21% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n- \u25cf We assessed the overall consistency of the Declaration based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe  procedures  performed  for  a  moderate  assurance  engagement  are  less  extensive  than  those  required  for  a reasonable  assurance  engagement  performed  in  accordance  with  the  professional  doctrine  of  the  Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes. A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive audit work.\n\n## Nature and scope of additional work on the information selected by the entity and identified by the \u221a symbol\n\nWith regard to the information selected by the entity presented in the Notes and identified with the \u221a symbol in chapter 2, 'Sustainable Development', we conducted the same procedures as those described in the 'Nature and scope of our work'  paragraph  (for  the  most  important  extra-financial  information).  However,  these  procedures  were  in  greater depth, particularly regarding the number of tests.\n\nThe selected sample represents between 51% and 83% of the information identified with the \u221a symbol.\n\nWe believe that these procedures enable us to express reasonable assurance regarding the information selected by the entity and identified with the \u221a symbol.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 25, 2022 KPMG S.A.\n\nAnne Garans\n\nPartner, Sustainability Services\n\nBertrand Pruvost\n\nPartner",

The  potential recommendations  from  this  code  which  have  not been followed are shown  in a section (see chapter 3.1.8 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  is  available  for  consultation on the Company's website.\n\n## 3.1 Composition, preparation and organization of the Board of Directors\n\nThis chapter describes the method for managing and directing  Renault  SA  as  a  listed  company  and  the parent company of Renault Group. This management method is also applicable to Renault s.a.s, a subsidiary of  Renault SA and the umbrella company for Renault Group's automotive and financial businesses.\n\nThe operating principles and missions of the Board of Directors  are  described  in  the  Board  Charter,  which is available  in  full  on  Renault  Group's  website. The  main  contents  of  the  Board  Charter  are reproduced below.\n\n## 3.1.1 Governance structure\n\n## Evolution of the mode of governance\n\nDuring  its  meeting  of  January  24,  2019,  the  Board  of Directors decided to separate the offices of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors considers that this governance structure is appropriate to Renault's current challenges.  It  enables  the  Company  to  benefit  from both the Chairman's stature and expertise in corporate governance and the managerial background and industrial and automotive expertise of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  charge  of  the management and the implementation of the Company's mid-term plan.\n\nThe  office  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  was entrusted to Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard on January 24, 2019, following his appointment as a Director 1 pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-17 par. 3 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting on January 28, 2020, appointed Mr. Luca de Meo as Chief Executive Officer of Renault SA and Chairman of Renault s.a.s, effective July 1, 2020.",

It shall also take into account the Company's purpose (raison d'\u00eatre).\n\nIn addition, the Board Charter limits the powers of the Chief Executive Officer as follows:\n\n## Excerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the limitations on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must obtain the authorization of the Board  of  Directors  for  any  external  growth transaction  and  any  acquisition  or  disposal  of  any ownership  in  any  company,  whether  existing  or  to  be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac250 million.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must inform the Board of Directors of  any  external  growth  transaction  and  any  acquisition  or disposal of any ownership in any company, whether existing or to be created, where the amount exceeds \u20ac60 million.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  determine  every  year  the  total amount  of  sureties  (cautions),  endorsements  (avals)  or guarantees (garanties), which the Chief Executive Officer may provide without requesting the Board's specific authorization.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer's obligation to hold shares\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors decided at its meeting on July 29, 2020, to set the minimum number of registered shares to be held by the Chief Executive Officer until the end of his term of office at 5,000 shares.\n\nThis minimum holding obligation complements the obligation for the Chief Executive Officer to retain until the end of his term of office 25% of the shares resulting from the free allocation of shares (for more details on the retention obligation, see chapter 3.2.4.2 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe minimum holding requirement ensures that a Chief Executive Officer who does not yet own shares resulting from free allocations of shares is aligned with the interests of shareholders upon taking office.\n\n## 3.1.2 Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting, with the exception of the Director designated by the French State pursuant to Article 4 of French Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on corporate governance and equity transactions in companies with public shareholding and the Directors representing the employees.\n\nThe term of office for Directors is four years. Pursuant to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code, these terms of office are staggered, to avoid them all ending and coming up for renewal at the same time.\n\nExcerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors determines and regularly reviews the desirable balance of its composition, particularly in terms of diversity  (representation  of  women  and  men,  nationalities, age, qualifications and professional experiences.",

The Governance and Compensation Committee appoints a recruitment  firm  to  assist  it  with  the  process  of selecting future independent directors.\n\nThe  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee selects  the  candidates  with  the  help  of  the appointed recruitment firm on the basis of criteria relating  to  their  professional  experience,  skills, independence  and  ethics,  while  maintaining  a gender  balance  between  men  and  women  and diversity  in  recruitment  in  accordance  with  the international dimension of the Group.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee then  presents  the  selected  candidate(s)  to  the Board  of  Directors  and  recommends  that  the Board co-opt or, as the case may be, propose to the Annual General Meeting that the candidates be appointed.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  co-opts  or,  as  the  case may  be,  proposes  that  the  Annual  General Meeting  appoint  the  selected  candidate(s)  as independent director(s).\n\n## \u25cf Appointment of directors proposed by Nissan\n\nIn accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the Restated  Alliance  Master  Agreement  ('RAMA'), which governs the ownership relationship between Renault and Nissan and regulates the governance of the Alliance, two of the members of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  are directors proposed by Nissan.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee, on the proposal of Nissan, recommends that the Board of Directors co-opt or, as the case may be, propose the  appointment  of  the  directors  representing Nissan to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nCorporate governance\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company co-opts or, as the case may be, proposes that the Annual General Meeting appoint the director(s) proposed by Nissan.\n\n## \u25cf Appointment  of  the  director  proposed  by  the French State\n\nPursuant to the provisions of French Order 2014-948 of  August  20,  2014,  on  the  governance  and capital  transactions  of  companies  with  public shareholding, as amended, one of the members of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company  is  a director nominated by the French State.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee, on the proposal of the French State, recommends that the Board of Directors co-opt or, as the case may be, propose the appointment of said director representing the French State to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the Company co-opts or, as the case may be, proposes that the Annual General Meeting appoint the director proposed by the French State.\n\n## \u25cf One director appointed by the French State\n\nPursuant to the provisions of French Order No. 2014-948 of  August  20,  2014,  on  the  governance  and  capital transactions of companies with public shareholding, as  amended,  the  French  State  may  appoint  a representative to the board of directors of companies in which it alone directly holds more than 10% of the share capital.

As  part  of  this program, new directors are given a presentation of the Group, its  governance and its  various  activities  during meetings  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Chief Financial  Officer,  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  of  the Group's  brands  (Renault,  Dacia  and  Lada,  Alpine, Mobilize), the managers of the business lines (engineering, manufacturing,  quality,  legal affairs, human resources, financial services and banking), and the  Alliance  General  Secretary.  In  addition,  the  new directors take part in visits to Group sites and factories.\n\nThe three directors representing employees and the director representing employee shareholders benefit from  in-house  training  provided  by  Renault  Group employees  and  training provided by external organizations.  This  training  helps  them  to  fully exercise their office by rapidly acquiring the specific skills required of a company director.\n\n## Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant  to Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial  Code,  the  Board,  of  Directors  has defined a diversity policy based on its past practices.\n\n## Policy criteria\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  seeks  a balance notably in terms of diversity (representation of women and men, nationalities, age, qualifications and professional experience). More precisely:\n\n- \u25cf regarding  the  size  of  the  Board  of  Directos,  the number  of  Board  of  Directors  members  must  be such  as  to  enable  reconciliation  of  the  skills, independence and specificities of Renault Group's shareholding;\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors, while complying at least with legal  requirements  and  the  recommendations  of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in terms of gender balance, considers  that  it  benefits  from  being  diverse  in  its composition (gender, nationality, culture);\n- \u25cf in  terms of skills, the Company seeks above all the complementarity of skills, profiles and experiences but also their relevance to the Company's strategy and to the challenges it faces;\n- \u25cf in terms of seniority, the Company seeks a balance between  experience  within  the  Board  of  Directors and progressive renewal of its composition;\n- \u25cf the  Board  of  Directors  expects  a  high  level  of commitment and ethics from each of its members.\n\n## Policy implementation\n\nTo  implement  this  diversity  policy,  the  Board  of Directors  uses  annual  evaluations  of  its  work  (for more details on the Board's evaluation, see section 3.1.7 of the Universal registration document). The progressive and planned renewal of the terms of offices makes it possible to anticipate the skills to be renewed  or  to  evolve  according  to  the  evolution  of the  industry  and  of  the  markets  in  which  the Company operates.\n\nImplementation of the diversity policy in 2021:\n\n- \u25cf the Board of Directors currently includes 17 Directors. This  number  remains  higher  than  the  average  for CAC  40  companies,  but  is  explained  by  the  level  of representation of the employees  and  of  the reference  shareholders  in  accordance  with  the  law, the  articles  of  association  or  agreements  entered into  with  Nissan,  and  the  desire  to  ensure  the presence  of  a  majority  of  Independent  Directors. As  such,  the  independence  rate  of  the  Board  of Directors as of December 31, 2021 was 69.2% 1 ;",

        "page_content": "Additional information\n\n- \u25cf the number of women on the Board of Directors at the close of the 2021 Annual General Meeting stands at  six,  i.e.  a  feminization  rate  of  46.2% 1 .  Moreover, two of the Board of Directors' three committees are chaired by women;\n- \u25cf the  Audit  and  Risks  Committee's  expertise  in finance  and  in  the  automotive  industry  was reinforced  by  the  appointment  of    Mr.  Bernard Delpit  (independent  director)  as  member  of  this committee, as of June 1, 2021;\n- \u25cf the  Strategy  and  CSR  Committee's  expertise  in digital, innovation and mobility was reinforced by the appointment  of  Mr.  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Mazzella  (independent director),  founder  and  chairman  of  BlaBlaCar  as member of this committee, as of June 1, 2021;\n- \u25cf the  Board  of  Directors  contains  four  different nationalities  and  a  majority  of  Directors  who  work or have worked abroad or in international groups;\n- \u25cf three  Directors  representing  employees  and  one Director  representing  employee  shareholders  are fully associated  in  the  work  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  its  committees.  In  addition,  their professional  background  as  well  as  their  trade union  activity  within  Renault  Group  gives  them  a solid  knowledge  of  the  Group's  organization  and activities;\n- \u25cf the changes in the composition of the Board and of its committees are part of the continuing implementation of this diversity policy of the Board of Directors.\n\nWith the exception of the Directors appointed on the proposal of Nissan and the Directors designated by the  French  State,  no  contracts  or  agreements  have been  concluded  with  the  shareholders,  clients, suppliers,  or  other  parties  allowing  any  of  these persons or one of their representatives to be selected as a member  of  the  Board  or  other  Senior Management body in the Company, thus mitigating potential or actual conflicts of interest.\n\nCorporate governance\n\n## Diversity policy applied to Senior Management\n\nThe Board of Directors also oversees the deployment of the  Group's  diversity  policy  by  Senior  Management.  In light of this, the Board of Directors and the Strategy and CSR  Committee  annually  review  the  Group's  diversity and inclusion policy, and more specifically the policy on the balanced representation of women and men on the governing bodies.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  there  were  two  women  on the  Board  of  Management,  including  the  Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  February  18,  2021,  the  Board  of Directors,  on  the  proposal  of  the  Senior  Management, defined  the  following  objectives  for  gender  diversity within  its  governing  bodies  including  the  Board  of Management, the Corporate Management Committee, and the Brand Management Committees. The percentage of women on the governing bodies should reach 30% before or in 2030, 35% before or in 2035 and 50% before or in 2050.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting of December 15, 2021, was informed of the results achieved during the financial  year  2021  and  the  means  the  Company deploys to achieve these objectives.\n\nFor  further  information  on  these  objectives  and  the diversity policy applied within the Group, see chapter 2.3.2.3 of the Universal registration document.\n\nI\n\n03",

The  Board  of  Directors,  on the  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation  Committee,  noted,  among  other things,  her  involvement  and  contribution  to  the discussions  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the Strategy  and  CSR  Committee,  of  which  she  is  a member, her international and business experience,  her  independence  and  lack  of  any conflict of interest;\n- \u25cf renewal  of  Mr.  Pierre  Fleuriot's  term  of  office  as independent  director.  The  Board  of  Directors,  on the  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation  Committee,  noted,  among  other\n\nthings,  Mr.  Pierre  Fleuriot's  major  role  in  the governance  of  Renault  in  his  capacity  as  Lead Independent Director and Chairman  of the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  and his  independence  and  lack  of  any  conflict  of interest;\n\n- \u25cf renewal  of  Mr.  Joji  Tagawa's  term  of  office  as director appointed  upon  proposal  of  Nissan. The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the  Governance  and  Compensation  Committee, welcomed  Nissan's  proposal  to  renew  Mr.  Joji Tagawa's term of office, given his experience and involvement in  the  work  of  the  Board  of  Directors and of the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  took  note  of  the expiry  of  Ms.  Pascale  Sourisse's  term  of  office  as director  at  the  end  of  the  2022  Annual  General Meeting and of her  wish  not  to  seek  the  renewal  of her  term  of  office.  The  Board  of  Directors,  on  the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation  Committee,  decided  not  to  replace her  and,  consequently,  to  reduce  the  number  of directors from 17 to 16 at the end of the 2022 Annual General Meeting.\n\nFollowing the Annual General Meeting on May 25, 2022, and subject to the approval of the resolutions submitted to a vote, the Board of Directors will be composed of 16 members and will have the following features:\n\n|                              | Composition following the 2021 General Meeting   | Composition following the 2022 General Meeting   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Independence rate            | 69.2%                                            | 66.7%                                            |\n| Feminization rate            | 46.2%                                            | 41.7%                                            |\n| Rate of non-French directors | 30.8%                                            | 33.3%                                            |\n\n## Therefore:\n\n- \u25cf the  independence  rate  of  the  Board  of  Directors will remain  above  that  recommended  by  the AFEP-MEDEF Code; and\n- \u25cf the  feminization  rate  will  be  above  that  required by law.\n\nIt is reminded that, pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  legal  provisions,  the  directors  representing  the employees and the directors representing employee\n\nshareholders  are  not  taken  into  account  when calculating the independence rate and the feminization rate.\n\nFor the sake of coherence, directors representing the employees  and  the  director  representing  employee shareholders  are  not  taken  into  account  when calculating the percentage of non-French directors.",

Rights and obligations of the directors\n\nThe Board Charter specifies the rights and obligations of the Company directors with respect to:\n\n- \u25cf the  rules  governing  the  operation  of  the  Board  of Directors and its committees;\n- \u25cf the duty of confidentiality;\n- \u25cf the independence and the duty of expression;\n- \u25cf the management of conflicts of interest;\n- \u25cf ethical  requirements  with  respect  to  financial market transactions; and\n- \u25cf holding  shares  in  the  Company.  Pursuant  to  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors' Charter recommends  that  the  directors  hold  a  significant number of shares in  registered  form  in  a  personal capacity in relation to the compensation received, except for directors who do not personally receive compensation. In this respect, the directors representing the employees and employee shareholders do not personally receive compensation  (which  is passed  on  to their respective  trade  unions);  they  are  therefore  not required  to  hold  a  significant  number  of  shares  in the  Company.  Furthermore,  legislation  prohibits directors  designated  by  the  French  State  from personally owning shares.\n\nFor  the  retention  obligation  applicable  to  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  see  chapter  3.2  of  the  Universal registration document.\n\n## 3.1.4.2. No convictions\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, none of its current  corporate  officers  has,  over  the  last  five years:\n\n- \u25cf been convicted of fraud;\n- \u25cf taken part as a corporate officer, general partner or founder  in  bankruptcy,  receivership,  or  liquidation proceedings;\n- \u25cf been  the  subject  of  any  charge  and/or  official public  sanction  pronounced  by  a  statutory  or regulatory authority; or\n- \u25cf been  prevented  by  a  court  from  acting  as  a member  of  an  administrative,  management,  or supervisory body of an issuer, or from taking part in managing or conducting the business of an issuer.\n\n## 3.1.4.3. No potential or actual conflicts of interest\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there is no potential or actual conflict of interest between any of the  private  interests  of  the  Company  directors  and their duties towards the Company.\n\nThere are no family ties between the members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe corporate officers are not bound to the Company or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  by  a  service  contract providing for any form of benefit to be granted.\n\nI\n\nCorporate governance",

Conversely,  the  Board  may  consider  that  a director  who  does  not  meet  the  aforementioned  criteria should nevertheless be considered as independent.\n\nPursuant to the Board Charter, the Board of Directors refers  to  the  criteria  set  forth  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code to identify situations that may compromise the exercise of freedom of judgment by directors.\n\nIn any event, it is recalled that, pursuant to the AFEPMEDEF  Code  and  in  accordance  with  the  Board Charter,  every  director  is  under  an  obligation  to inform the Board of Directors of any potential conflict of interest situation and to refrain from attending the debate  and  from  participating  in  the  vote  of  the corresponding deliberation.\n\nEach  year,  the  Company  sends  a  questionnaire  to each  director in order to assess his or her independence in accordance with the criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee and the Board  of  Directors  shall also review the\n\nEach year, the Governance and Compensation Committee shall  discuss  for  each  director,  whether  such  director should be considered as independent, and the independence  of  each  director  shall  be  examined  on  a case-by-case basis by the Board of Directors in light of the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  Upon appointment of a new director or renewal of the terms of office a director, the question of whether such director may be considered as independent should also be discussed.\n\nclassification of each director as independent in light of these same criteria.\n\nAs part of this review, the Governance and Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors pays  particular  attention  to  the  assessment  of  the materiality of the business relationships between the directors and the Company, both from the standpoint of  the  Group  and  of  the  relevant  director.  This assessment  shall  be  carried  out  in  the  light  of qualitative criteria, such as the nature of the business relationships,  and  quantitative  criteria,  such  as  the amounts committed under these relationships.\n\nAccordingly,  to  qualify  as  independent,  the  Board  of Directors  ensures  that  there  were  no  significant  cash flows  between  the  Company  and  any  company  of which  Company's  directors  are  directors  or  Executive Officers,  in  particular  by  examining  the  share  these companies account for in the Company's revenue.",

                    | Independent        |\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  February  17,  2022,  the  Board  of Directors examined  the  situation  of  Mr.  JeanDominique Senard with regard to criterion no. 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, given his capacity as director of Nissan and Chairman of Renault s.a.s. for the period from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020.\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that  the  Board  of  Directors  must  assess  to  possibly exclude  someone  from  the  status  of  independent director  is  that  of  'not  being  or  not  having  been, during  the  past  five  years,  an  employee,  executive offer,  or  director  of  a  company  that  the  company consolidates.'  According  to  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code implementation  guide,  this  recommendation  also applies  when  a  director  holds  'an  office  in  a company  in  which  the  first  company  holds  a  noncontrolling  but  significant  stake,  or  in  a  sister company'.\n\nIt  is  recalled  that  Nissan  is  not  a  company  fully consolidated  by  Renault.  Renault  has  significant influence over Nissan and therefore accounts for its interest in Nissan using the equity method (for more details  on  Renault's  shareholding  in  Nissan,  see note 12 in chapter 5.2.2.6.2 of the Universal registration document).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  held  that the  appointment  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors of Renault to the Board of Directors of Nissan, with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr. Jean-Dominique  Senard's  freedom  of  judgement  and independence with respect to Renault.\n\nFurthermore,  should  such  a  situation  give  rise  to  any conflict  of  interest,  the  provisions  of  the  Board  Charter requiring  the  director  in  question  to  abstain  from participating in the deliberations and votes of the Board of Directors would apply.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Committee Committee,  considered  that  the  performance  by Mr. Jean-Dominique Senard of the duties of Chairman of Renault s.a.s. from October 11, 2019, to June 30, 2020, was of  an  exceptional  and  purely  temporary  nature,  during the  time  required  for  the  Board  of  Directors  to  conduct the  succession  process  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and until the arrival of Mr. Luca de Meo on July 1, 2020. The Board  of  Directors  therefore  considered  that  this exceptional  situation  was  not  such  as  to  call  into question  the  independence  of  Mr.  Jean-Dominique Senard at the end of this temporary term of office.\n\nI",

Pursuant  to  the recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the directors representing  the  employees  and  the director  representing  employee  shareholders  have not  been  taken  into  account  when  calculating  the independence rate, which is thus 69.2%.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided to maintain a Lead Independent  Director  appointed  from  among  the Independent  Directors  despite  the  separation  of  the functions  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and Chief Executive Officer implemented in January 2019.\n\nThe  position of Lead  Independent  Director  is currently filled by Mr. Pierre Fleuriot.\n\nThe powers of the Lead Independent Director are set out in the Board Charter.\n\n## E xcerpt of the Board Charter provisions governing the Lead Independent Director\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may,  on  the  proposal  of  the Governance  and  Compensation  Committee,  appoint  a Lead Independent Director from among directors considered to be independent.\n\nIf the functions of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the  Chief  Executive  Officer  are  combined,  the  Board  of Directors is required to appoint a Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe  Lead  Independent  Director  shall  be  appointed  for  a term that shall not exceed his/her term of office as director. He/she  shall  be  eligible  for  reappointment  as  Lead Independent Director. The functions of the Lead Independent Director may be terminated at any time by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director shall replace the Chairman in the following cases:\n\n- \u25cf if the  Chairman  is  temporarily  unavailable,  for  the duration of his/her unavailability;\n- \u25cf in the event of the Chairman's death, until the election of a new Chairman.\n\nMore generally,  the  Lead  Independent  Director  shall  chair meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  in  the  absence  of  the Chairman.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director shall:\n\n- \u25cf be  consulted  by  the  Chairman  regarding  the  agenda  of each meeting of the Board of Directors and the schedule of meetings; the Lead Independent Director may propose to  the  Chairman  additional  agenda  items  for  a  Board  of Directors'  meeting  or  the  convening  of  a  Board  of Directors'  meeting  regarding  a  particular  matter,  whose importance or urgency would justify holding an extraordinary meeting; convene the Board in exceptional circumstances,  after  having  sought  the  opinion  of  all Committees Chairs;\n- \u25cf be  appointed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  as  Chair  or member  of  one  or  more  Committees  of  the  Board  of Directors;  in  any  event,  the  Lead  Independent  Director may attend meetings and have access to the work of all committees;\n- \u25cf convene,  at  least  once  per  year,  if  the  functions  of  the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are combined, a meeting of the Board's members in the absence of the Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and,  as  the  case may be, of the Chief Operating Officer(s). Those meetings shall be convened, in particular, to assess the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and,  as  the  case  may  be,  of  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer(s), and to examine their respective compensation; the  Lead  Independent  Director  shall  preside  over  the debates during such meetings;",

On  these  occasions,  Mr.  Pierre  Fleuriot  had  the opportunity to discuss the evolution of the Board of Director's  operation  and  to  note  the  shareholders' main concerns and expectations, that he reported to the Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.1.5.2.

The conclusions of the evaluation were presented at the Governance and Compensation Committee meeting on  February  15,  2022,  and  then  at  the  Board  of Directors meeting on February 17, 2022.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  questionnaire  and  of  the interviews  with  the  members  of  the  Board  was  to evaluate the following themes:\n\n- \u25cf the  composition,  role,  structure,  missions  and operation  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its Committees;\n- \u25cf the  relationships  between  the  Board  of  Directors and Senior Management; and\n- \u25cf the directors' contribution and collective efficiency; and\n- \u25cf follow-up on the points for improvement identified in the previous evaluation.\n\nThe evaluation provided an opportunity to learn from the  experience  of  recent  events,  in  particular  since the last external evaluation in 2020, and to reassess the  ways  in  which  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its Committees operate.\n\nIt  highlighted  the  main  changes that have occurred since 2020, i.e.:\n\n- \u25cf a  strengthening  of  the  Board's  skills  in  financial matters,  thanks  to  the  appointment  of  Mr  Bernard Delpit, and in digital, innovation and mobility matters, thanks to the appointment of Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mazzella;\n- \u25cf significant progress in the operation and  a generally positive view of the reorganization of the Committees in 2021;\n- \u25cf a  deeper  involvment  of  the  Board  on  Renault's strategy,  in  particular  thanks  to  the  arrival  of  the new Chief Executive Officer and the briefings at the initiative of the Chairman of the Board;\n- \u25cf a strengthened consideration of CSR issues,  thanks to the implementation of a sustainable development  strategy  (environmental,  social  and societal  issues)  and  to  the  merger  of  the  Strategy Committee with the Ethics Committee;\n- \u25cf an increase of the duration of Board and Committee meetings.\n\nThis  evaluation  identified  recommendations  and areas for improvement, such as:\n\n- \u25cf the continued strengthening of international profiles within the Board, with general management  experience,  having  an  expertise  in the automotive industry and in new mobility;\n- \u25cf a better understanding at Board level, and not only at committee  level,  of  topics  related  to  succession planning, talent and diversity;\n- \u25cf a  strengthened  information  of  the  Board  on  the changing competitive environment;\n- \u25cf the  need  to  devote  even  more  time  to  debates  on strategic orientations and  to monitoring the implementation  of  the  long-term  strategy  of Renault and its various brands;\n- \u25cf a  strengthened  information  of  the  Board  on    the perception  by  the  various  stakeholders,  of  the  Group (including  the  extra-financial  part),  on  the  one  hand, and of the Board of Directors and its functioning, on the other hand.\n- \u25cf continuing  and  intensifying  the  appropriation  of ESG topics by the Board of Directors in addition to the  work  carried  out  by  the  Strategy  and  CSR Committee.\n\n## 3.1.8 Implementation of the 'comply or explain' rule\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  Company  refers to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, whose recommendations it follows.\n\nPursuant to the 'comply or explain' rule in Article 27.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of  the  French  Commercial Code, the recommendations of that Code that have not been followed and the related explanations are summarized in the table below:\n\nI\n\n03",

In its recommendations,  the Governance and Compensation Committee takes into account  the  balance  of  the  different  components  of the corporate officers' compensation.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  the  non-executive corporate officer is  based  on  a  fixed  compensation and  does  not  include  any  variable  or  exceptional cash compensation, nor compensation for directorship.\n\nThe compensation policy for the executive corporate officer is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices:\n\n- 1. Cosely linked to the Company's strategy\n- 2. Performance-oriented\n- 3. Focus on long-term performance\n- 4. Close alignment with shareholders\n- 5. Competitive compensation\n- 6. Compensation which does not encourage excessive risk-taking\n- \u25cf The compensation is closely linked to the implementation and results of the strategy.\n- \u25cf The  variable  component  of  the  executive  officer's  compensation represents a fraction of the total compensation that is consistent with market practice and ensures the interests of the executive officer are aligned with the Company's performance.\n- \u25cf A significant part of the executive officers' compensation depends on multi-year targets being achieved.\n- \u25cf The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the corresponding total value.\n- \u25cf The executive officer must retain 25% of the shares vested pursuant to performance share plans until the end of his term of office.\n- \u25cf Competition between corporate officers in the automotive market is intense. It is therefore of prime importance to ensure that the overall compensation of the executive officer is competitive compared to the practices of the Company's peers, both CAC 40 companies and, more generally, comparable companies in the Automotive sector in Europe and worldwide.\n- \u25cf The  setting  of  performance  targets,  a  sufficiently  long  evaluation period,  and  compensation  capping  allow  excessive  short-term  risktaking to be avoided.\n\nThese principles are established in compliance with the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  to which the Company refers pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nMore generally,  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee regularly ensures that corporate officers' compensation complies with all applicable laws and recommendations in terms of corporate governance.\n\nI\n\n03",

This analysis is based, firstly, on the panel of CAC 40 French companies, and secondly, on the practices of comparable multinational organizations  in  the  Automotive  sector  (Stellantis, General Motors, Ford, Honda, Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen, Volvo and Toyota).\n\nThe Governance and Compensation Committee also takes  into  account  the  expectations  voiced  by Renault's shareholders by way of regular meetings.\n\n## Compensation structure for the executive corporate officer\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer consists of:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion , corresponding to a fixed compensation in cash determined in line with the role,  level  of  responsibility,  and  experience  of  the executive corporate officer;\n- \u25cf a portion  subject  to  performance  conditions , comprising two distinct sub-components:\n\n- \u25cf Pay  for  failure:  pay  variable  components  in  the  event  of poor performance of the Group\n- \u25cf Place  a  disproportionate  weight  on  short-term  variable compensation versus long-term variable compensation\n- \u25cf Overly  weight  qualitative  criteria  in  the  annual  variable compensation\n- \u25cf Reward excessive or inappropriate risk-taking\n- \u25cf Have extraordinary severance payments in addition to the two-year non-compete indemnity\n- \u25cf Provide  excessive  severance  or  sign-on  arrangements  to our executives\n- \u25cf annual variable compensation :  this aims to ensure that  part  of  the  compensation  of  the  executive corporate officer depends on the Company's main operational,  financial,  and  managerial  objectives being achieved during the year,\n- \u25cf long-term compensation : this consists of performance shares, designed to strengthen the alignment  of  the  interests  of  the  executive corporate officer  with  those  of  shareholders  by making their vesting subject to the achievement of  performance  criteria  assessed  over  a  period of  three  years.  In  addition  to  the  performance criteria,  the  vesting  of  shares  is  subject  to  a presence condition of three  years  following  the allocation of the performance shares.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  may  benefit from top-up pension schemes, a termination benefit in the event of dismissal, a non-compete agreement as well as benefits in kind that are customary for this ty,pe  of  position  (company  cars,  health  and  life insurance schemes, etc.).\n\nPursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEPMEDEF  Code  and  the  recommendations  of  the French  Financial  Market  Authority  (Autorit\u00e9  des March\u00e9s Financiers, AMF), the Chief Executive Officer does  not  hold  an  employment  contract  with  the Company or any of its subsidiaries.",

This FR2 rate is broader than the FR1 rate (used for the 2020 compensation policy), which applied only to a list of more serious injuries requiring off-site treatment.\n\nThe FR2 rate decreased and stands at 1.75% in 2021, compared to an initial target of 2.3%. There has also been a significant decrease in the most severe accidents.\n\nUpon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that this indicator has been met.\n\n## \u25cf Gender pay-gap ratio\n\nSpecific  actions  in  each  country  led  to  a  reduction  in  the  average wage gap between men and women. The target of an average gap of 2.5% has been exceeded to reach a rate of 1.3% by the end of 2021. Upon  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Compensation\n\nCommittee, the Board of Directors noted that this indicator has been met.\n\n- \u25cf Definition  of  the  Climate  plan  (strategy,  timetable  and  quantified indicators)\n\nThe decarbonization strategy, included in Renault Group's sustainability  strategy,  was  validated  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and then presented at the Annual General Meeting on April 23, 2022. This ambitious  strategy,  broken  down  into  binding  objectives  and  in  line with stakeholders' expectations, is described in the \"Climate Report\", which  is  available  on  the  Group's  website,  and  in  chapter  2  of  the Company's Universal Registration Document.\n\nUpon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors noted that this indicator has been met.\n\n## c) Customer satisfaction / Quality : 10% (out of a maximum of 15%)\n\nOut  of  the  two  indicators  related  to  this  criterion,  one  has  been  fully achieved and the other one has been partially achieved.\n\n- \u25cf Reduction  of  the  incident  rate  (number  of  incidents  on  vehicles under warranty after 3 months on the road)\n\nThis  indicator,  called  \"GMF  3MIS  WORLD\",  is  a  measurement  of  the\n\nnumber of incidents on vehicles after three months on the road. The objective  of  reducing  this  rate  was  achieved,  with  a  28%  reduction compared to the previous year, for an annual reduction target of 20%. Upon recommendation of the Governance and Compensation\n\nCommittee, the Board of Directors noted that this indicator has been met.\n\n- \u25cf Customer satisfaction level\n\nThis  level  is  measured  mainly  through  satisfaction  surveys  of customers of Renault Group's sales and after-sales dealerships. Each customer  gives  a  score,  and  the  result  is  the  dealer's  Net  Promoter Score (NPS). This NPS is then consolidated by country by aggregating all the dealers in that country.\n\nThe  objective  set  for  this  indicator  was  to  achieve  a  significant improvement in the NPS in at least 80% of Renault's 16 largest markets (France,  Germany,  Italy,  Spain,  the  United  Kingdom,  Poland,  Belgium, Romania,  Russia,  Turkey,  Morocco,  India,  Argentina,  Brazil,  Colombia and South Korea). In 2021, the result obtained in this area was 83.33%, exceeding the target set.\n\nUpon  the  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and  Compensation Committee, the Board considered that, despite the achievement of the target for this indicator, there was still room for improvement in terms of customer satisfaction. Consequently, the Board has set the level of achievement of this indicator is 10% out of a maximum of 15%.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors noted that the total achievement rate of the performance criteria was 145% for the 2021 financial year and  consequently  decided  to  set  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo's  variable compensation for that financial year at a gross amount of \u20ac1,885,000.\n\nI\n\n03",

Modification  of  a  performance  criterion  of  the  long-term variable  compensation  of  Mr  Luca  de  Meo,  Chief  Executive Officer, allocated for the 2020 financial year\n\nResolution submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022 pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code\n\nTwelfth  resolution  -  Approval  of  the  modification  of  a performance criterion of the long-term variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer allocated for the 2020 financial year\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting under the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Board  of  Directors'  report on corporate governance referred to in Article L.225-37 of the  French  Commercial  Code,  approves,  pursuant  to  the provisions of Articles L.22-10-8 and L.22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, (i) the modification of the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2020 financial year, as approved by the General Meeting of June 19, 2020 in its fourteenth resolution, and consequently (ii) the modification of a performance criterion of the longterm variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer allocated  for  the  financial  year  ending  on  December  31, 2020,  the  allocation  of  which  had  been  approved  by  the Annual  General  Meeting  of  April  23,  2021  in  its  fifteenth resolution, as described in chapter 3.2.2.3 of the Company's 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\nWhile the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation for financial year 2021 corresponds to a strict implementation of his compensation  policy,  the  Board  of  Directors deemed it necessary to propose an adjustment to one of the  criteria  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  long-term variable compensation for fiscal year 2020 in order to take into  account  the  impact  of  the  Covid  crisis  on  the implementation  of  compensation  policies  within  the Renault  Group.  This  adjustment  is  in  line  with  the adjustment  made  to  the  employee  performance  shares plan affected by the health crisis, in order to preserve the retention value attached to these plans.\n\nThe Board took into account the fact that:\n\n- \u25cf the  Free  Cash  Flow  (FCF)  target  for  the  2020-20212022  period  was  set  well  before  the  start  of  the pandemic; and\n- \u25cf the FCF for the 2020 financial year (-\u20ac4.2 billion) is not representative of the performance of the Group and of the CEO over the reference period of the plan.\n\nIn  addition,  in  the  absence  of  an  adjustment,  the exceptionnal  situation  for  the  2020  financial  year would result in the loss of all rights under this criterion over  all  three  years  of  performance,  corresponding to  30%  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  long-term variable compensation.\n\nThis situation does not reflect the performance of the CEO since his arrival and the implementation of the Renaulution  strategic  plan.  At  the  end  of  2021,  The Group  took  a  decisive  step  in  its  recovery.  Renault Group  achieved  its  \u20ac2bn  fixed  cost  reduction  plan compared  to  2019  one  year  ahead  of  schedule  and lowered  its  breakeven  point  by  40%  compared  to 2019, 2 years in advance of the initial reduction target of more than 30% by the end of 2023 forecast in the Renaulution  plan.  The  Group  largely  exceeded  its 2021 financial targets despite the impact of semiconductor  shortages  and  rising  raw  material prices: (i) the Group's operating margin amounted to \u20ac1.7 billion in 2021 (3.6% of revenues), an improvement of \u20ac2 billion vs. 2020, and thus reached 2 years ahead of schedule the Renaulution objective of an operating margin above 3%; (ii) Automotive operational Free Cash Flow (FCF) reached \u20ac1.3 billion, contributing  to  a  \u20ac2  billion  reduction  in  Automotive net debt.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and upon the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board  of  Directors  has  exceptionally  decided  to neutralize  the  2020  financial  year  in  the  calculation  of",

The Combined General Meeting on June 15, 2018  set  the  annual  compensation  amount  to  be divided  among  the  directors  for  the  2018  financial year  and  subsequent  financial  years  at  \u20ac1,500,000, until the Annual General Meeting decides otherwise.\n\nThe  policy  for  allocating  directors'  compensation adopted by the Board of Directors on October 18, 2019 sets a maximum  annual  amount  of  directors' compensation for participation in Board of Directors' meetings and meetings of each of the  committees, which will include:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion;\n- \u25cf a  variable  portion  which  depends  on  the  effective attendance of members at Board of Directors and/ or committee meetings.\n\nThe variable portion relating to effective attendance at  Board  of  Directors  and  committee  meetings  is predominant  compared  to  the  fixed  portion,  in compliance  with  the  recommendation  21.1  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code Committee\n\nThis compensation policy for directors was approved by  the  General  Meeting  of  April  23,  2021  (nineteenth resolution).\n\nThe table below sets out the rules for calculating directors' compensation in 2021:\n\n|                                   | Annual  fixed  portion   | Annual  variable  portion   | Total  individual  amounts   | Additional annual  fixed portion for  Chairmanship   | Additional annual fixed  portion for Lead  Independent Director   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors                | \u20ac18,000                  | \u20ac35,000                     | \u20ac53,000                      | \u20ac0                                                   | \u20ac20,000                                                           |\n| Audit and Risks Committee ('CAR') | \u20ac5,000                   | \u20ac15,000                     | \u20ac20,000                      | \u20ac20,000                                              | -                                                                 |\n| Committees (excluding CAR)        | \u20ac5,000                   | \u20ac10,000                     | \u20ac15,000                      | \u20ac10,000                                              | -                                                                 |\n\nIt  is  reminded  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors does not receive any compensation for his directorship.\n\nIt  is  specified  that  the  three  directors  representing employees  and  the  director  representing  employee shareholders  hold  employment  contracts  within subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  receive  in  this respect  remuneration  that  is  not  related  to  the exercise of their directorship. Therefore, such remuneration will not be disclosed.\n\nIn  addition,  directors  are  entitled  to  reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in the exercise of their office,  in  particular  any  travel  and  accommodation\n\nexpenses in connection with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.\n\nPursuant  to  the  rules  of  the  compensation  policy approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of  April  23,  2021,  the total  gross  amount  of  compensation  attributable  to directors for the 2021 financial year amounts to \u20ac1,152,897.\n\nThe  individual  amounts  of  directors'  compensation are shown in the table below and will be paid in one lump sum in 2022.\n\nDirectors  currently  in  office  did  not  receive  any compensation or benefit of any kind from Renault SA or  the  companies  it  controls  other  than  what  is indicated in the table below.",

However, as Renault SA does not have any employees, the indicators were calculated based  on  the  compensation  of  the  France-based employees of five companies, all being wholly-owned subsidiaries  of  Renault  SA.  These  are  Renault  s.a.s, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Transmissions Automatiques (STA), Sofrastock, RCI Banque SA and Renault Retail Group (RRG France).\n\nThe  35,976  people  who  were  employed  in  2021  by these  five  companies  represent  86%  of  the  Renault Group's workforce in France as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCompensation  presented  in  the  table  includes  the following components:\n\n- \u25cf fixed  compensation  paid  during  the  indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf variable  compensation  paid  during  the  indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf compensation  for  directorship,  if  applicable,  paid during the indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf book  value  of  the  benefits  in  kind  paid  during  the indicated financial year;\n- \u25cf performance shares allocated during the indicated financial year (at IFRS value);\n- \u25cf profit-sharing  and  incentive  bonuses  paid  during the indicated financial year.\n\nCompensation  for  both  employees  and  corporate officers  of  Renault  s.a.s,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Transmissions Automatiques,  Sofrastock,  RCI  Banque  SA  and  RRG France has been annualized.\n\nThe  relevant  corporate  officers  for  this  comparison are the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  latter  function  having  existed within the Group up to January 24, 2019.\n\nThe  compensation  presented  is  related  to  the function  and  not  to  the  person,  so  that  a  change  in executive corporate officer for a same function does not impact the presentation of the information over the five-year period.",

Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2022 financial year\n\nDuring  its  meeting  on  February  17,  2022,  the  Board  of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, set the compensation policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the  2022 financial year.\n\nResolution submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022 pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code\n\nFourteenth  resolution  -  Approval  of  the  compensation policy  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the  2022 financial year\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting under the conditions of  quorum  and  majority  required  for  ordinary  general meetings,  having  reviewed  the  report  on  corporate governance referred to in Article  L.  225-37  of  the  French Commercial  Code  describing  the  components  of  the compensation  policy  for  the  directors  and  corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  22-10-8  II.  of  the  French Commercial Code, the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2022 financial year, as set out in chapter 3.2.4.2 of the Company's 2021 Universal registration document.\n\nThe  compensation  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer takes  into  account  the  responsibilities  and  duties assumed  and  that  are  inherent  to  this  corporate office,  as  well  as  the  level  of  skills,  experience,  and the career path of the person holding this position.\n\nIt  is  based  on  an  analysis  made  by  the  Governance and Compensation Committee of the compensation paid to CAC  40  companies  and  international automotive groups (Stellantis,  Volkswagen,  Daimler, BMW, Volvo, Toyota, Honda, Ford et General Motors).\n\nPursuant  to  the  principles  of  the  compensation policy,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  compensation for 2022 consists of:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion, corresponding to a fixed compensation  in  cash  determined  in  line  with  the role,  level  of  responsibility,  and  experience  of  the executive corporate officer;\n- \u25cf a portion subject to performance  conditions, comprising two distinct sub-components:\n- \u25cf annual variable compensation: this aims to ensure that  part  of  the  compensation  of  the  executive corporate officer depends on the Company's main operational,  financial,  strategic  and  sustainability objectives being achieved during the year,\n- \u25cf a long-term compensation consisting of performance shares, designed to strengthen the alignment  of  the  interests  of  the  executive corporate  officer  with  those  of  shareholders  by making their vesting subject to the achievement of performance criteria assessed over a period of three  years.  In  addition  to  the  performance criteria,  the  vesting  of  shares  is  subject  to  a presence  condition  of  three  years  following  the allocation of the performance shares.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  eligible  to participate  in  any  co-investment  plans  that  may  be set  up  by  the  Group  for  the  benefit  of  its  senior management.\n\nLast,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  may  benefit  from top-up pension schemes, a termination benefit in the event of dismissal, a non-compete agreement as well as benefits in kind that are customary for this type of position  (company  cars,  health  and  life  insurance schemes, etc.).\n\n## Annual fixed compensation\n\nThe annual fixed compensation  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer  remains  unchanged  since  July 2020,  at  a  gross  annual  amount  of  \u20ac1,300,000, payable in twelve monthly instalments.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe  amount  of  annual  variable  compensation  may reach  150%  of  the  fixed  compensation  paid  if  all performance criteria  are  fully  achieved.  The  annual variable compensation will be fully paid in cash.\n\nFor the 2022 financial year, the performance criteria set by the Board of Directors include four quantifiable criteria and three strategy and sustainability criteria. The Board of Directors considered that these are key indicators  of  Renault  Group's  performance  and  in particular in the implementation of the \"Renaulution\" strategic plan.\n\nI\n\n03",

The level of transparency is maintained and the\n\ndistinction  between \"quantifiable\" and \"qualitative\" criteria is specified for each performance criterion.\n\nLast, the quantifiable criteria  for the annual variable compensation  have  been  increased  from  100%  to 120%  of  fixed  compensation;  they  thus  remain predominant, which is in line with the best practices applied by the Group.\n\nThe  criteria  and  their  weighting  are  shown  in  the tables below.\n\n## Financial criteria for the 2022 financial year (0% to 90% of fixed compensation)\n\nThe \"Renaulution\" strategic plan has led to a reorientation of the Renault Group's strategy by focusing on value creation  rather  than  on  volume.

The number of performance  shares  allocated  to  the  Chief Executive  Officer  is  expressed  as  an  absolute number, rather than as a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price  will  affect  the  total  value  of  such  long-term compensation.\n\nThe  Chief  Executive  Officer  receives  performance shares  under  the  same  criteria  as  the  other executives  in  the  Group  (see  chapter  3.2.5  of  this Universal  registration  document),  subject  to  an additional  performance  criterion  (total  shareholder return  -  TSR)  applied  to  him  in  his  capacity  as executive corporate officer.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Governance  and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of February  17,  2022  decided  that  75,000  performance shares  would  be  allocated  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer, representing  the  maximum  number  of performance shares that may be awarded in respect of  the  2022  financial  year.  This  allocation  would represent 0.0253% of Renault SA's share capital.\n\nPerformance  criteria  will  be  measured  over  a cumulative three-year period (2022, 2023 and 2024).\n\nVesting  of  performance  shares  is  also  subject  to  a three-year presence condition starting from the date of the allocation by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  number  of  shares  fully  vested  by  the  Chief Executive  Officer  out  of  the  performance  shares allocated to him will depend on the achievement of the following performance criteria.",

In  order  to receive this benefit, the following cumulative conditions should be met over the last two financial years preceding the departure:\n\n- \u25cf a  minimum  total  achievement  rate  of  80%  of  the performance  criteria  for the annual  variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25cf achievement of the Group's free cash flow target.\n\n## Non-compete indemnity\n\nAt its meeting held on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors  authorized  the  conclusion  of  a  noncompete agreement with Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  it  is  in Renault's  interest  to  enter  into  this  non-compete agreement which protects Renault Group's legitimate interests, given the particularly competitive  nature  of  the  automotive  market,  the importance of the functions and the recognized skills of  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  in  this  market,  the  means available  to  him,  and  the  sensitive  information  he holds and to which he can have access.\n\nUnder this agreement, Mr. Luca de Meo commits, as of  the  end  of  his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive Officer,  not  to  engage,  directly  or  indirectly,  in  an activity that competes with those of the Group, on his own  behalf, on behalf of companies  in the automotive  design,  construction  and  marketing sectors (mainly passenger cars and light commercial vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers.\n\nApplication of this clause is limited to:\n\n- \u25cf a period of twelve (12) months following the date on which  Mr.  Luca  de  Meo  effectively  ceases  to exercise his term of office;\n- \u25cf the  countries  of  the  European  continent  and  in Japan,  as  well  as  European  and  Japanese  car  and equipment manufacturers.\n\nAs consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr. Luca de Meo will receive from the Company, during the  period  of  application  of  the  agreement  (twelve months) and subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial compensation corresponding to one year of gross annual compensation  (fixed  compensation  and  annual variable  compensation  paid  in  cash),  payable  in twelve monthly  instalments.  The  gross  annual compensation  used  for  this  calculation  will  be  the one  paid  during  the  twelve  months  preceding  the date of termination of the corporate office.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendation  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code at the time of Mr. Luca de Meo's departure, the Board of Directors of the Company will decide whether to apply this non-compete agreement, and may unilaterally waive it. Furthermore,  no  compensation  will  be  due  in  the event of retirement or if Mr. Luca de Meo has reached the age of 65.\n\n## Top-up pension scheme\n\nDuring its meeting on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a top-up pension scheme for Mr. Luca de Meo.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that implementing this scheme to the benefit of Mr. Luca de Meo allows the  Company  to  retain  and  to  promote  the  Chief Executive Officer's loyalty.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's top-up pension scheme is identical to that available to members of the Group Executive Committee (the so-called 'Article 83' plan and 'Article 82' plan).",

For this reason, the Chief Executive Officer will receive a lump-sum  indemnity  equal  to  the  amount  of  the contribution  paid  on  his  behalf  to  the  insurer.

In  this  context, the Board of Directors will be particularly cautious to ensure that any changes made are correlated to the performance of the Group, in light of the circumstances, and to the situation of all stakeholders.  The  Board  of  Directors  will  make  its decision on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee and shall explain and justify  its  decision  with  regard to the circumstances that  led  to  the  use  of  this  option  and  the  alignment with  shareholders'  interests.  Any  use  of  this  option will be communicated to the shareholders.\n\nI\n\n03",

Compensation policy for directors for the 2022 financial year\n\nAt its meeting held on February 17, 2022, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, set the compensation  policy  for  directors  for  the  2022 financial year.\n\nResolution submitted to the Annual General Meeting of May 25, 2022 pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II. of the French Commercial Code\n\n## Fifteenth  resolution  -  Approval  of  the  compensation policy for directors for the 2022 financial year\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting under the conditions of  quorum  and  majority  required  for  ordinary  general meetings,  having  reviewed  the  report  on  corporate governance referred to in Article  L.  225-37  of  the  French Commercial  Code  describing  the  components  of  the compensation  policy  for  the  directors  and  corporate officers set by the Board of Directors, approves, pursuant to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.22-10-8  II.  of  the  French Commercial Code, the compensation policy for directors for the 2022 financial year, as set out in chapter 3.2.4.3 of the Company's 2021 Universal registration document.\n\n## Overall budget for directors' compensation\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  June  15,  2018  set  at \u20ac1,500,000 the maximum amount of compensation to be allocated among the directors (seventeenth resolution).\n\n## Allocation policy\n\nThe new policy for allocating directors' compensation adopted by the Board of Directors for the 2022  financial  year  consists  of  setting  a maximum annual amount of directors' compensation for participation in Board of Directors' meetings and meetings of each of the  committees, which will include:\n\n- \u25cf a fixed portion, pro-rated according to the duration of the office over the year; and\n- \u25cf a  variable  portion,  pro-rated  according  to  the attendance rate over the total number of meetings for the year.\n\nThe  variable  portion  related  to  attendance  at  the meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees is  preponderant  compared to  the  fixed portion.\n\nThe  advantages  of  this  allocation  policy  are  that  it will prevent  the  annual  maximum  amount  for directors'  compensation  from  being  exceeded,  and there will be a strong correlation between compensation and attendance.\n\nAs  compared  to  the  directors'  compensation  policy for the 2021 financial year, the new policy for the 2022 financial year proposes to align the annual variable portion  for  members  of  all  of  the  Committees  with that of the members  of  the  Audit  and  Risk Committee.  Similarly,  the  additional  annual  fixed portion  for  the  chairmanship  of  each  Committee would  be  aligned  with  that  of  the  Chairman  of  the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe following table sets out the rules for calculating directors' compensation:\n\n|                    | Annual fixed  portion   | Annual  variable  portion   | Total  individual  amounts   | Additional annual  fixed portion for  Chairmanship   | Additional annual  fixed portion for Lead  Independent Director   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors | \u20ac18,000                 | \u20ac35,000                     | \u20ac53,000                      | \u20ac0                                                   | \u20ac20,000                                                           |\n| Committees         | \u20ac5,000                  | \u20ac15,000                     | \u20ac20,000                      | \u20ac20,000                                              | -                                                                 |\n\nIt  is  reminded  that  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors does not receive any compensation for his directorship.\n\nThe  amount  of  compensation  for  each  director  for the  2022  financial  year  will  be  set  by  the  Board  of Directors called to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year.\n\nDirectors'  compensation  for  the  2022  financial  year will be paid in one instalment in 2023.\n\nIt  is  specified  that  the  three  directors  representing employees  and  the  director  representing  employee\n\nshareholders  hold  employment  contracts  within subsidiaries  of  the  Company  and  receive  in  this respect  remuneration  that  is  not  related  to  the exercise of their directorship. Therefore, such remuneration will not be disclosed.\n\nIn  addition,  directors  are  entitled  to  reimbursement of expenses incurred by them in the exercise of their office,  in  particular  any  travel  and  accommodation expenses in connection with meetings of the Board of Directors and of committees.",

Legal framework\n\nIn  its  eighteenth  resolution,  the  Combined  General Meeting  on  June  12,  2019  authorized  the  Board  of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with free  allocations  of  existing  Company  shares  and/or Company shares to be issued (so-called performance  shares)  for  the  benefit  of  salaried members  of  staff  and/or  corporate  officers  and/or French  or  non-French  companies  or  groups  directly or  indirectly  related  to  it,  or  certain  categories thereof, pursuant to the terms of Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nPerformance  share  plans  are  decided  annually  by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee.\n\nIn accordance  with  best  market  practices,  the vesting of performance  shares  is subject to (i) performance  conditions  set  by  the  Board  of Directors  assessed  over  a  minimum  period  of three  years  and  (ii)  a  minimum  vesting  period  of three years.\n\nThe  beneficiary  of  performance  shares  must  be  an employee or corporate officer within Renault Group at the vesting date of the shares. In case of departure from  Renault  Group  before  the  vesting  date,  the beneficiary loses his/her entitlement to the performance  shares  granted  to  him/her,  except  in the case of compulsory or voluntary early retirement.\n\nIn the event of the death, total or partial invalidity, or extended  sick  leave  of  the  beneficiary,  they  retain the  benefit  of  the  performance  shares,  and  the performance conditions do not apply.\n\nPerformance share allocations granted pursuant to the aforementioned authorization are subject to the following caps being observed:\n\n- \u25cf the total number of performance shares allocated may not exceed 2% of the share capital over three years, with a sub-limit of 0.67% of the share capital each year;\n- \u25cf the total number of performance shares allocated may  not  exceed  10%  of  the  share  capital  on  the date  on  which  the  Board  of  Directors  decides  on their allocation;\n- \u25cf the  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  to senior executive officers may not exceed 15% of the total number of shares allocated;\n- \u25cf the  number  of  performance  shares  allocated  to members of the executive committee (also known as Board of Management) may not exceed 30% of the  total  number  of  shares  allocated,  including performance shares allocated to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant to the eighteenth resolution of the Combined General Meeting on June 12, 2019, performance share allocations  do  not  result  in  any  dilution  for  the shareholders,  as  the  performance  shares  allocated are shares held by the Company itself.\n\nThe  authorization  granted  at  the  Annual  General Meeting of June 12, 2019 to the Board of Directors to allocate  performance  shares  will  expire  in  2022.  A new authorization will be proposed to the shareholders  for  approval  at  the  Annual  General Meeting to be held on May 25, 2022.\n\n## 3.2.5.2. Allocation policy for the performance share plans\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  approves  the  performance share plans based on the work and recommendations of the Governance and Compensation Committee. The committee examines the  allocation  proposals  for  certain  Renault  Group employees presented by the Chief Executive Officer, pursuant  to  the  general  scheme  set  by  the  Annual General Meeting.\n\n## The purpose of share allocations\n\nThe aim of performance share allocations is primarily to personally associate the worldwide management of  Renault  Group,  in  particular  the  members  of management  bodies,  with  the  development  of  the Group's value by allowing them to share ownership of the Company.\n\nIt also  provides  recognition  of  executives  whose outstandingly  positive  action  has  contributed  to Renault Group's results.\n\nLastly,  it  helps  to  promote  loyalty  in  executives  who are  of  particular  value  to  the  Company,  notably executives with a high potential for career development.  The  allocation  of  shares  increases their  commitment  and  motivation  to  implement growth in the Company.\n\nThis scheme has proved to be a factor in strengthening the  role  of  responsibility  centres  throughout  Renault Group worldwide, more particularly  in  the  Automotive sector,  sales  subsidiaries,  vehicle  and  mechanical engineering, bodywork and power train plant managers,  industrial  subsidiaries,  as  well  as  for  all program  managers  and  vehicles  or  components project  managers.  It  is  also  applied  in  sales  financing, as well as for the managers of large support functions in Renault Group.\n\nI\n\n03",

Employee shareholding policy\n\nIn  line  with  the  objective  of  significantly  increasing the employee shareholding level by 2030, the Board of  Directors  of  February  17,  2022  supported  the principle  of  a  strong  policy  of  developing  employee shareholding  as  part  of  the  deployment  of  the Renaulution strategy.\n\nThis  revival  of  employee  shareholding  within  the Renault  Group  is  included  in  certain  resolutions submitted to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 25, 2022. It forms part of the Renaulution plan and embodies  Renault Group's  strategic  and  managerial  commitment  to give  all Renault  Group  employees  a  long-term opportunity  to  share  in  the  fruits  of  future  growth, starting with the strategy's second phase, 'Renovation'.\n\nIt  will  also  strengthen  collective  commitment,  thus fuelling the success of the new strategy and aligning the long-term interests of Renault Group employees with those of shareholders, whilst also contributing to the stability of Renault shareholding.\n\nThis  policy  is  based  on  the  following  strategic orientations:\n\n- \u25cf Regular  implementation  of  collective  employee shareholding  offers,  which  could  take  the  form  of an offer to acquire shares under the Group Savings Plan and the International Group Savings Plan, with employees being able to benefit from a maximum\n\n## Senior executives\n\nSenior  executives  are  beneficiaries  and  the  number of  performance shares allocated vary, according to their level of responsibility, performance, and results. Certain senior executives may not be beneficiaries.\n\n## Other beneficiary executives\n\nThe other beneficiaries are usually senior managers and managers with high professional or managerial development  potential  or  with  a  high  level  of expertise. There are numerous  complementary systems for assessing and selecting these beneficiaries (level of responsibility, annual appraisal interview, career committees, specific monitoring for high potential executives, etc.); these systems allow various observations which help us to find the most deserving candidates.\n\nOver  the  past  five  years,  the  total  number  of performance share beneficiaries has been:\n\n- \u25cf 1,060 under the 2017 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,123 under the 2018 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,322 under the 2019 plan,\n- \u25cf 1,421 under the 2020 plan, and\n- \u25cf 2,015 under the 2021 plan.\n\ndiscount  of  30%  on  the  price  of  the  shares  and  a matching  contribution,  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the French Labor Code. In order to give all  Group  employees  an  opportunity  to  become shareholders, Renault could also make a collective free allocation of shares.\n\n- \u25cf Long-term  variable  compensation  through  annual grants of performance  shares,  subject  to  a minimum  three-year  presence  condition  from  the date of grant and demanding  performance conditions, assessed over at least three consecutive financial years.\n- \u25cf Implementation of a co-investment plan offered to the  Group's  key  executives,  including  the  Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Board of Management  and  of  the  Corporate  Management Committee, based on each participant's voluntary, personal investment in Renault shares at risk, for a minimum period of five years, and which may give entitlement,  subject  to  compliance  with  strict attendance and performance conditions, to Renault  performance  shares.  This  dynamic  plan aims to promote the commitment of key executives to the Group's strategy.\n\nThe various mechanisms of this plan will be deployed in  as  many  countries  as  possible,  depending  on regulatory and technical constraints, and will enable employees to acquire shares on preferential terms.",

The  risk  management  and  internal  control processes are implemented in all corporate functions and activities. The main objectives are:\n\n- \u25cf identify and manage risks to which the company is exposed;\n- \u25cf ensure compliance with rules, laws and regulations;\n- \u25cf control  quality,  cost  and  delivery  times  in  its activities;\n- \u25cf ensure that financial, accounting and management disclosures are reliable, relevant and of a high standard.\n\nThese  structures  and  procedures  cannot,  however, offer  an  absolute  guarantee  that  the  company's objectives  will  be  achieved.  In  order  to  mediate between  the  opportunities  and  risks,  Renault  Group's global  risk  management  system  aims  to  reduce  the impact and/or probability of events having a significant influence on the control of operations or the fulfilment of objectives. The internal control and risk management  systems  identify  and  assess  risks  by measuring  the  level  of  risk  factor  control  and  the efficacy of management plans.\n\nThe group comprises the following operating segments:  Renault  Group's  Automotive  Division (excluding AVTOVAZ), Mobility Services, which include  activities  related  to  new  forms  of  mobility (mainly  the  holding  company  Renault  MAI  and  its subsidiaries), the AVTOVAZ  group, and Sales Financing (RCI Banque).\n\nSince 2007, Renault Group has taken into account the reference framework and implementation guidelines of the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF), which were updated in July 2010, and the recommendations of the Audit Committee  working  group  report published  in  July  2010.  This  framework  applies  to  the Automotive and Mobility Services segments.\n\nThe AVTOVAZ group has management autonomy and has implemented an internal control system and risk management  system  in  accordance  with  Russian legislation  and  the  organization  described  in  this chapter; any variations are indicated and explained.\n\nIn accordance with banking and financial regulations, RCI Banque Sales Financing has defined its own  internal  control  framework,  outlined  in chapter  4.1.6  'Specific  aspects  of  the  RCI  Banque group in terms of internal control and risk management'. RCI Banque is subject to controls by the  French  Prudential  Supervisory  Authority  (ACPR) and the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n## 4.1.1 Contributors to risk management\n\nSince 2021, Renault Group's Automotive Division has been structured around two main components:\n\n- \u25cf 'Business  Units'  for  each  brand  are  responsible  for margins  and  customer  satisfaction.  They  drive  the organization towards targeted customers and markets.\n- \u25cf 'Corporate  Functions'  include  all  other  business lines  of  the  company. They define the policies and provide standards, methods and skills appropriate\n\nto  the  activities.  First,  engineering is  directly  linked to  the  brands  and  bears  full  responsibility  for  the timing, costs and performance of product development.\n\nThis structure does not exist for the AVTOVAZ group.\n\nSales Financing has its own internal control and risk management systems and organization, as outlined in chapter 4.1.6 of this Document.",

Operational management is responsible for identifying  the  risks associated  with  each  activity  and  implementing actions to reduce their impact.\n\nEmployees are therefore required to comply with the internal  control  system  defined  for  their  field  of activity,  the  group's  code  of  ethics,  the  guide  for preventing corruption and influence peddling, as well as their own dedicated codes of ethics. Operational management is responsible in particular for defining and  monitoring  the  implementation  of  action  plans following  assignments  conducted  by  the  Internal Audit Department.\n\n## Second line of control: Risk Management, Internal Control, Performance and Control\n\nBeyond their role as the first line of control via their employees and managers, the 'Corporate' Functions also contribute as a second line of control, as their management is responsible for:\n\n- \u25cf establishing  and  circulating  standards,  reference texts and group policies,\n\nRisk and control\n\n- \u25cf regulatory monitoring,\n- \u25cf forming and coordinating an internal and external network of correspondents,\n- \u25cf ensuring  that  their  policies  and  standards  are properly understood and applied,\n- \u25cf performing  controls,  when  necessary,  within  the operational  entities  to  check  that  they  are  being implemented.\n\nThey are supported in this process by:\n\n- \u25cf the  Internal  Control  Department,  which  provides reasonable  assurance  on  the  level  of  internal control by assessing its maturity and effectiveness. For this purpose,  it  circulates  self-assessment questionnaires and carries out compliance tests. It also  ensures  that  action  plans  are  identified  and implemented to correct the shortcomings identified;\n- \u25cf the Risk Management  Department,  which  is responsible  for  updating  the  mapping  of  the group's  major  risks  and  monitoring  action  plans designed to reduce the impact or probability of the main  risks  identified  and  for  providing  support  for the  risk  mapping  of  operating  entities,  corporate functions and new vehicle projects;\n- \u25cf the  Group  Performance  and  Control  Department, with its representatives in the entities, which coordinates  and  steers  the  process  in  the  field.  It ensures that all personnel comply with management rules and assists operational staff in the coordination and monitoring of their action plans.\n\n## Third line of control: Internal Audit Department\n\nThe Internal Audit Department conducts an independent and objective assessment of the corporate  governance,  risk  management  and  control processes  as  defined  within  the  group.  The  mission, role,  responsibilities  and  scope  of  the  Internal  Audit Department  are  laid  down  in  an  audit  charter,  the updated  version  of  which  was  approved  by  the  Audit and  Risk  Committee  (CAR)  in  May  2021.  Through  its recommendations,  Internal  Audit  contributes  to  the improvement of operational security and the optimization of the overall performance  of  the company. At the end of each assignment, Internal Audit distributes a final report and summary note, which are systematically  distributed  to  the  areas  audited,  the functions, entities and/or projects in question, the Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  Chairman  of  the  group.  The summary  note  includes  an  opinion  issued  by  Internal Audit  that  aims  to  give  an  overall  assessment  on  the level  of  control  of  the  audited  activities:  satisfactory (green), some improvements needed (yellow), substantial improvements needed (orange), insufficient (red).\n\nThe Internal Audit Department covers all entities and activities  of  Renault  Group's  Automotive  branch, excluding AVTOVAZ, which has its own internal audit structure, and Mobility Services.\n\nI\n\n04",

The  Internal  Audit Department  can  also  audit  functions  that  have converged with Nissan. For entities in partnership with Renault  Group,  Internal  Audit  may  intervene  if  the partner  so  agrees.  For  activities  entrusted  to  third parties, intervention by Internal Audit is possible if the contract's audit clause so provides.\n\nThe audit plan is made on an annual basis and covers a  three-year  period  starting  in  2022.  It  is  verified  by Senior Management and approved by the Audit and Risk  Committee  (CAR).  This  audit  plan  is  revised  as necessary to take into account additional requests or adjustments required as a result of changing health conditions, including travel restrictions.\n\nInternal Audit assignments make it possible to:\n\n- \u25cf assess  the  compliance  of  processes  and  their application  with  the  rules,  standards,  laws  and regulations in force;\n- \u25cf assess  the  effectiveness  of  processes  and  the performance of transactions;\n- \u25cf verify  the  quality  of  the  controls  performed  by  the operational  departments  and  the  support  and control functions;\n- \u25cf suggest  areas  for  improvement  or  progress  in  the form of recommendations;\n- \u25cf fight against fraud and corruption;\n- \u25cf verify the effective implementation of the recommendations.\n\nFollowing the recommendations made in each audit report, an action plan defined by the audited entities is approved by the internal audit function. Recommendations  have  three  levels  of  criticality\n\n(high, medium and low, identified respectively as A, B and C).  The  Internal  Audit  Department  ensures  that the  recommendations  are  implemented.  At  least every six months, it prepares a progress report on A and B recommendations for the Board of Management and the CAR.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  department  is  certified  by  the French Institute of Audit and Internal Control (IFACI) 1 . This  certification,  in  accordance  with  the  standards for  the  professional  practice  of  internal  auditing (r\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel  professionnel  de  l'audit  interne  -  RAI), comprises  25  general  requirements  divided  into 100  detailed  requirements  across  five  categories: positioning, steering, audit processes, GRC (governance,  risks  and  compliance)  assessment program and professionalism.\n\n## Synchronization of activities\n\nIn  order  to  have  a  shared  vision  of  the  group's  risks and priority issues, to define a consistent approach, and to have effective follow-up between the second (Risk Management, Internal Control and Performance  and  Control  Department)  and  third (Internal Audit) lines of control, the Risk Management, Internal  Control  and  Internal  Audit  departments regularly  work  together  closely.  They  synchronize their  activities  and  ensure  that  their  combined actions provide reasonable control of risks.\n\nThese  actions  were  reinforced  in  2021  with,  for example,  the  systematic  integration  of  the  findings of  internal  audits  and  the  annual  internal  control campaign  into  the  risk  management  of  the  group, operational entities, corporate functions and projects. Improvements to this synchronization were shared with the CAR during the year.\n\n## 4.1.2 Governance of risk management\n\nThe  first two  lines of control report on risk management  and  internal  control  to  the  Risk  and Internal  Control  Committee  (CRCI),  which  is  also responsible  for  validating  and  regularly  assessing the  effectiveness  of  the  internal  control  and  risk management systems.\n\nThis  committee,  chaired  by  the  Deputy  CEO  and  the CFO of the group, consists of 20 members representing the  various  corporate  functions  of  the  company.  It meets five times a year and examines, in particular:\n\n- \u25cf The mapping of the group's major risks and, in each of these areas, the monitoring of treatment actions.\n- \u25cf The  results  of  the  annual  internal  control  selfassessments  conducted  by  the  Internal  Control Department and the monitoring of the associated action plans.\n- \u25cf Proposals for improving the systems.\n\nFollowing  this  review,  the  CRCI  may  decide  on corrective actions or request additional information.\n\nThe first two lines of control also report to the Board of  Management  (BOM)  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  through thematic presentations.\n\nThe  second  and  third  lines  of  control  present  the results of their work to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR), whose duties are defined in chapter 3.1.6.\n\nIn  the  course  of  their  duties,  the  statutory  auditors assess  the  level  of  risk  management  and  internal control of the preparation  and  processing  of accounting and financial data as required and, when necessary, issue recommendations.",

        "page_content": "## 4.1.3 Risk management system\n\nThe group applies a risk management method based, on  one  hand,  on  identifying  and  assessing  risks  of any kind, which are then mapped, and, on the other hand, on carrying out action plans to deal with these risks, and  specifically  their  net  impact  and/or probability  of  occurrence,  by  means  of  elimination, prevention, protection or transfer. The identification of  risks  is  based  on  assessments of residual impact and  probability  of  occurrence  (after  taking  into account the management plans), where the product of these two terms defines the criticality. This method applies at the level of the group, entities, corporate  functions  and  new  vehicle  projects.  The mapping  of  major  group  risks  (descending  and ascending) is presented to the CRCI, BOM and CAR, which validate it.\n\nThe major risk factors to which the group is exposed are described in chapter 4.2.\n\nTo carry out its duties, the Risk Management Department (DMR) relies, in particular, on two networks:\n\n- \u25cf one  comprising  correspondents  mainly  from  the performance and control function for the operating entities  (countries,  commercial  and/or  industrial subsidiaries) and the corporate functions, and from the  quality  assurance  function  for  new  vehicle projects.  These  correspondents  are  known  as Operational  Risk  Managers  (RMO).  They  work  with the Risk Management Department on the operational  implementation  of  risk  management processes  within  the  entities,  corporate  functions and projects;\n- \u25cf the  other  made  up  of  experts  who  manage  a specific area of risks. These may be risks common to  all  companies  or  specific  to  one  of  Renault Group's  segments  of  activity.  These  experts  are known as Expert Risk Managers (RME) and consult on the standardized risk management plans in their area of expertise.\n\nTo  draw  up  the  audit  plan  for  the  company's  major risks, which is validated by Senior Management and\n\napproved by the CAR, the Internal Audit Department uses  risk  maps  to  identify  the  most  pertinent  audit themes  and  assess  risk  coverage.  Through  its auditing task, the Internal Audit Department provides the  Risk  Management  Department  with  insight  on the effective level of control of major risks.\n\nThe risk management policy is applied at group level for major risks.  It  is  rolled  out  at  the  operating  entity  level (countries,  commercial  and/or  industrial  subsidiaries), for Corporate Functions and for new vehicle projects.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Risk  Management  Department  focused its activities on:\n\n- \u25cf updating  the  mapping  of  the  group's  major  risks. This  exercise  was  conducted  by  combining  the mapping work for 2020 with a bottom-up approach based  on  the  analysis  of  the  risk  maps  of  the entities, corporate  functions  and  new  vehicle projects performed at the end of 2020 and in 2021;\n- \u25cf consolidating  treatment  plans  and  processes  to improve the control of the major risks;\n- \u25cf reinforcing  the  governance  of  major  risks  through regular sharing with the BOM and the CAR;\n- \u25cf assisting the operational entities, corporate functions and new  vehicle projects for the implementation  of  risk  maps  produced  with  the operational  risk  managers  concerned  and  for  the monitoring of treatment plans;\n- \u25cf leading  the  network  of  operational  risk  managers and  experts  and  the  representatives  of  the performance  and  control,  internal  control  and internal audit functions in sharing best practices.\n\nIn  addition,  awareness-raising  actions  for  group employees about risk culture and the fundamentals of  risk  management  were  continued  by  the  Risk Management  Department  (communication and training, in particular through e-learning modules).\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

These elements  are  made  available  to  the  financial managers  of  the  group's  corporate  entities  and subsidiaries  through  a  dedicated  SharePoint  site, which  is  managed  and  updated  by  the  Internal Control Department.\n\nThe Internal Control Department relies on a network of internal control correspondents who are affiliated with  the  Performance  and  Control  function  of  the subsidiaries and corporate functions and are the key contacts  for  internal  control  issues.  They  lead  and ensure the implementation  of  internal control objectives within their scope.\n\n## Control activity\n\nOnce  a  year,  an  internal  control  self-assessment questionnaire campaign based on these risk control factors  is  sent  to  the  group's  main  entities  by  the Internal Control Department. The CEOs of the entities validate  these  self-assessments  and  commit  to defining  and  implementing  action  plans  to  remedy any  internal  control  shortcomings  identified.  These\n\naction plans are subject to regular monitoring by the Internal Control Department.\n\nThe results of these self-assessments are presented to  the  Risk  and  Internal  Control  Committee  (CRCI) and the CAR once a year.\n\nCompliance tests are conducted based on a sample of  entities  by  the  internal  controllers  of  the  Internal Control Department to verify the quality of the selfassessments. This internal control system applies to the parent company and all significant entities, fully consolidated companies in particular.\n\nEntities  with  lower  risk  levels  (entities  not  fully consolidated or unconsolidated entities) are subject to separate internal control systems.\n\nNewly acquired companies are consolidated according to their potential risk impact in the various internal  control  systems  during  the  first  campaign following  their  integration.  In  the  first  year  of  selfassessment, the results are not consolidated with the group results, as the focus is on the action plans.\n\nThe work of the Internal Control Department in 2021 included:\n\n- \u25cf continued action to improve the corruption prevention system and support for the operational staff concerned,\n- \u25cf updating of risk control factors taken into account for the 2021 self-assessment campaign,\n- \u25cf deployment of internal control training: more than 300  managers  and  more  than  15  management committees trained over the past three years,\n- \u25cf definition  of  preventive  and  detection  controls based on a data analytics approach,\n- \u25cf reviewing  the  rules  for  delegation  of  authority  to take into account changes in the group's method of governance.\n\nThe 'tone at the top' in terms of internal control was reaffirmed by the circulation of an editorial signed by the  CFO  in  the  introduction  to  the  annual  selfassessment questionnaire.\n\nThe  priorities  in  2022  will  be  to  continue  these underlying actions begun in previous years.\n\n## Internal delegations and separation of offices\n\nIn  addition  to  command-line  structures,  the  group has set up a staff reporting system so that corporate function  managers  can  provide  leadership  for  their function correspondents throughout the group.\n\nThe decision-making process is based on a system of internal  delegation  that  determines  in  which  areas and at which levels operational managers may make decisions.

Group  Management  Control  develops  performance guidelines for each of the operating segments, brands and  functions.  These  include  the  macroeconomic assumptions  to  be  taken  into  account  (exchange rates, interest rates, inflation rates, commodity prices, etc.),  the  financial  and  non-financial  indicators  to  be measured  in  the  following  year,  the  timing  and  the segmentation of the scope of activity.  Each  brand  is responsible  for  forwarding  these  instructions  to  the subsidiaries  within  its  scope  after  supplementing them in the light of specific aspects of the functions.\n\nThe performance and control function is responsible for managing and measuring economic performance at the various levels of the organization (group, operating segments, brands, functions).\n\nManagement control is carried out in a decentralized manner  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  specific aspects  of  each  function.  A  framework  is  provided for its duties, in particular, by the periodic instructions provided  by  the  Group  Performance  and  Control Department.\n\nUnder the group's management plan, its role is to:\n\n- \u25cf set out the group's economic objectives and budget;\n- \u25cf participate  in  the  implementation  of  the  internal control system and Renault Group's risk management approach;\n- \u25cf coordinate the group by measuring the performance  of  entities, operating segments, brands and functions and, in particular, by monitoring indicators relating to operating margin for  all  operating  segments  and  free  cash  flow  for the Automotive operating segments;\n- \u25cf analyze  proposed  management  decisions  at  any level  from  an  economic  perspective,  check  their consistency  with  standards,  plans  and  budgets, judge their economic relevance and give an opinion and recommendation on them.\n\nFor  the  preparation  of  accounting  and  financial information, the group  relies on management reference  guidelines  indicating  the  fundamental management principles applicable to the company.\n\nThe  internal  control  system  for  accounting  and financial information is based on the AMF reference framework. It covers not only the processes involved in  preparing  financial  information,  for  closing  the accounts, forecasting phases or financial communication  but  also  the  upstream  operational processes involved in producing this information.\n\nThe  group  has  information  systems  that  allow  the simultaneous  production  of  financial  statements according  to  local  standards  and  group  standards. This mechanism thus guarantees the consistency of data in a context of centralization and consolidation of  information  within  a  short  time  frame.  Under  the functional  authority  of  the  VP,  Group  Accounting (DCGr),  responsibility  for  drawing  up  the  financial statements  lies  with  the  Chief  Financial  Officers  of the subsidiaries, who report to the Chairpersons and Chief Executive Officers of these same subsidiaries.\n\nA  manual  defines  the  group's  shared  standards  of presentation  and  valuation.  This  manual,  which  is updated  year  after  year,  is  made  available  to  all entities  via  the  group's  portal  and  ensures  the consistency of the reported financial information.\n\n## Principles applied in preparing the financial statements\n\nRenault  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements are  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  International Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  published  by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the adoption regulations of which were published in the  Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union  as  of  the reporting date.\n\nThe Group Accounting Department, which is under the direct  authority  of  the  group's  Chief  Financial  Officer, has an 'Accounting Standards' unit.

These statements are prepared in  advance  on  the  basis  of  two  pre-closing  dates: 31  May  for  the  June  closing  and  31  October  31,  for  the December  close.  Summary  meetings  are  organized with  the  statutory  auditors  and  attended  by  Senior Management as part of their ongoing discussions. The CAR  is  involved  at  every  key  stage  of  the  approval process  for  financial  and  accounting  disclosures. Consolidated revenues are published quarterly.\n\n## Key components of the process for controlling financial and accounting disclosures\n\nRenault Group manages the decentralized operations  of  the  subsidiaries  in  its  four  operating segments  in  France  or  abroad  by  relying  on  the following  key  strategies  to  deliver  high-quality accounting and financial information while reducing the time needed to prepare the financial statements:\n\n- \u25cf standardization  of  operational  systems  upstream of accounting is systematically sought;\n- \u25cf deployment  of  the  financial and  accounting modules  of  the  ERP  chosen  by  the  group  in  the industrial and/or  commercial,  engineering  and sales financing entities throughout the world.\n\nThis  software  package  ensures  that  processed  data are reliable and consistent. In particular, the definition and  monitoring  of  user  profiles  helps  to  ensure  that the rules of task separation are respected.\n\nControl of basic transactions handled by operational systems, where the initial control takes place, is key to  ensuring  that  accounting  and  financial  data  are reliable.  The  operational  systems  feed  data  to  the auxiliary  accounting  systems  through  interfaces. These interfaces, which are continually monitored to\n\nensure  they  capture  all  economic  events  for  each upstream  process,  then  rapidly  and  regularly  send these data to the centralized accounting system.\n\nThe  accounting  teams  have  worked  with  IT  staff  to develop  a  security  process  to  protect  the  ERP  in  the event  of  a  major  malfunction.  A  business  continuity plan  has  been  prepared  at  corporate  level.  It  is deployed in those subsidiaries that use the ERP.\n\n## Statutory auditors' charter\n\nIn connection with the statutory audit of its accounts, Renault Group took the initiative in 2004 of drafting a charter  concerning  the  tasks  and  independence  of the statutory auditors and signing it with them. This charter  governs  the  relationship  between  Renault Group  (the  parent  company  and  the  French  and foreign  subsidiaries)  and  its  statutory  auditors.  The charter was updated in 2020 as part of the renewal of the  Board  of  Auditors  in  2019  to  take  into  account regulatory changes relating to statutory audits.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nRenault Group has chosen to entrust all of the group's financial  communication  to  the  Investor  Relations Department  within  the  Finance  Department  and  to provide it with the functions necessary to accomplish this mission.\n\nThe Investor Relations Department is responsible for:\n\n- \u25cf communication with the financial markets;\n- \u25cf relations with investors and individual shareholders;\n- \u25cf relations with financial rating agencies;\n- \u25cf relations with analysts and investors specialized in socially responsible investments;\n- \u25cf relations with the regulatory authority (AMF);\n- \u25cf steering  the  preparation  of  the  annual  and  halfyearly earnings reports and quarterly information;\n- \u25cf filing the Universal Registration Document with the AMF,  produced  under  the  responsibility  of  the Internal Control Department.",

The RCI  Banque  group's  Internal  Control  Committee  has validated  the  general  framework  for  this  system, which is described in the Internal Control Charter.\n\nThis  charter  defines  the  system  applicable  to  the French and foreign companies over which RCI Banque has effective control and specifies in particular:\n\n- \u25cf the  general  arrangements  for  managing  internal control;\n- \u25cf the  local  arrangements  for  subsidiaries,  branches and joint ventures;\n- \u25cf the  special  arrangements  for  various  functional areas.\n\nRisk control at RCI Banque is overseen on three levels by separate functions:\n\nThe  first line of defense is exercised  by  the operational  functions  in  charge  of  day-to-day  risk management as part of the activities in their area of expertise. These functions decide and are responsible  for  taking  risks  in  the  conducting  of transactions  and  the  objectives  assigned  to  them. They exercise this responsibility in accordance with the management rules and the risk limits defined by the Corporate functional departments.\n\nThe Corporate functional departments are in charge of risk definition, rules, management  methods, measurement and monitoring at the corporate level. Each department, in  its  area  of  expertise,  manages and  oversees  the  risk  management  system  via guidelines and country objectives. Risk is monitored by  periodic  dedicated  committees  both  in  the subsidiaries  and  centrally.  These  departments  rely on  local  representatives  for  risk  measurement  and exposure  monitoring  and  ensure  that  limits  are respected at the group level.\n\n## The second line of defense includes:\n\n- \u25cf the Internal Control  Department  of  the  Risk Management Division and the  internal  controllers for  the  group  entities,  which  control  the  level  of compliance of transactions with the management rules  defined  in  the  procedures.  More  specifically, they verify the relevance of the first line of defense;\n- \u25cf the Risk and Banking Regulations Department of the Risk Management  Division,  which  oversees  the deployment  of  the  group's  risk  governance  policy, verifies  the  efficiency  of  risk  management  by  the functional departments and of compliance with the limits  and  alert  thresholds  established  and  ensures that the Risk Committee of the RCI Board of Directors is notified when those thresholds are exceeded;\n- \u25cf the  Compliance  Department,  which  coordinates the  compliance  measures  throughout  the  RCI\n\nGroup and ensures that they are properly implemented throughout the RCI Group.\n\nThe third line of defense is the internal audit function, which  aims  to  provide  assurance  to  RCI  Banque's Board  of  Directors  and  Senior  Management  about the  degree  of  control  over  transactions  and  the oversight exercised by the first two lines.\n\nThe risk management  system  covers  all  the macroprocesses  of  the  RCI  Banque  group  and includes the following tools:\n\n- \u25cf a  list  of  the  main  so-called  critical  and  significant risks for which  a  pilot, appetite  level, alert thresholds  and  limits  are  defined  (Risk  Appetite Framework).  For  each  risk,  a  detailed  analysis  is performed  that  identifies  the  components  of  the risk and the management and oversight principles that keep it in line with the risk appetite level. These elements  are  reviewed  at  least  once  a  year  in connection  with  the  RCI  Banque  group's  business model and strategy;\n- \u25cf the  mapping  of  operational  management  rules contributes to risk management; it is deployed in all of the  RCI  Banque  group's  consolidated  subsidiaries. This  mapping  is  updated  regularly  by  the  central business activity departments. The level of control of operational management rules is assessed annually by the process owners in all subsidiaries;\n- \u25cf the  incident  collection  database  helps  to  identify malfunctions that correspond to predefined criteria and enables the corrective and preventive measures  required  to  control  risks  to  be  put  in place.  This  database  is  used  for  internal  and regulatory  reporting  purposes.  The  system  sets thresholds for immediately communicating incidents  to  RCI  Banque's  Executive  Committee, RCI  Banque's  Board  of  Directors,  Renault  Group's Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  (CEC),  the French  Prudential  Supervisory  Authority  (ACPR) and the European Central Bank.\n\n## Bodies and actors involved in RCI Banque's internal control and risk management\n\nThe RCI Banque Board of Directors, as a supervisory body, has the following responsibilities:\n\n- \u25cf it  decides  on  the  bank's  business  strategy  and monitors the implementation, by Executive Directors and the Executive Committee, of supervisory  procedures  to  ensure  effective  and prudent management;\n- \u25cf it approves and periodically reviews the strategies and  policies  for  taking  on,  managing,  monitoring and reducing risk;\n- \u25cf it examines  the  governance  model,  periodically assesses its effectiveness, and ensures that corrective action is taken to remedy any shortcomings;\n\nI\n\n04",

It  assists  the  Board  in terms  of  control.  It is also responsible  for analyzing action plans in  the  event  that  limits  or alert thresholds are exceeded and for examining the pricing systems for products and services. In parallel with the Compensation Committee, it also has the task of examining whether the compensation  policy  is  compatible  with  the company's risk exposure. With a view to advising the  Board  of  Directors,  this  committee  is  also responsible  for  the  analysis  and  approval  of  the internal  control  report,  compliance  with  capital (ICAAP)  and  liquidity  (ILAAP)  regulations,  the recovery  plan  and  significant  aspects  of  the rating and estimating processes derived from the company's internal credit risk models;\n- \u25cf the Compensation Committee meets at least twice a  year.  It  examines  the  compensation  policy  for company officers and the Head of Risk Management annually and prepares  decisions  for the Board of Directors regarding the compensation of  individuals  who  have an impact on risk and risk management;\n- \u25cf the Appointments Committee meets at least twice a  year.  It  has  the  task  of  recommending  directors to the Board of Directors. It is also in charge of the annual review of the Board of Directors, including its  structure,  membership,  gender  diversity  and breadth of directors' knowledge, skills and experience. It submits nominations to the Board for Executive  Directors,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, Deputy Chief Executive Officers and the holders of key positions.\n\nThe Executive Committee, the group's Senior Management body, directs RCI Banque's policy and strategy.\n\nSenior Management relies on the following committees to oversee the group's risk management:\n\n- \u25cf the Financial Committee,  which  reviews  the following topics: economic analysis and forecasts, cost  of  funds,  liquidity  risks,  interest  rate  risk  and counterparty  risk  in  the  different  areas  and subsidiaries  of  the  group.  The  balance  sheet  and income statement of RCI Holding are also analyzed to make the necessary adjustments to intra-group transfer pricing;\n- \u25cf the Credit Committee, which approves commitments exceeding the authorization limits of subsidiaries and the Group Head of Commitments;\n- \u25cf the  Credit  Risk  Committee,  which  validates  the action plans in the event that the cost of risk levels validated  for  each  country  as  part  of  the  budget process are exceeded;\n- \u25cf the  Performance  Committee,  for  'Customer  and Network  Risks',  which  evaluates  the  quality  of customer origination and benchmarks subsidiaries'  performance  in  terms  of  recovery. Within  the  dealership  network,  changes  in  the outstanding  portfolio  and  inventory  turnover  are reviewed,  together  with  changes  in  dealer  and portfolio classification;\n- \u25cf the  Regulatory  Committee,  which  reviews  major regulatory  changes,  prudential  supervision  and action plans,  and  validates  internal  rating  models and the associated management policy;\n- \u25cf the Internal Control, Operational Risk and Compliance Committee, which oversees the group's  entire  internal  control  system,  monitors quality and  related procedures, and  adapts resources,  systems  and  procedures.  It  defines, manages  and  monitors  the  principles  of  the operational risk management policy and compliance control  system.  It  also  keeps  track  of action  plans.  This  committee  also  exists  within each RCI Banque group subsidiary;\n- \u25cf the New Product Committee, which approves new products  before  they  are  marketed,  by  ensuring the  compliance  of  the  new  products  with  the group's  commercial  policy,  the  group's  budget requirements,  locally  applicable  legislation  and group risk governance.\n\nProcess  owners  have  been  appointed  for  each macroprocess and are responsible for risk management in their respective areas of expertise in line with group standards, defining and updating the corresponding procedures and first-level controls.\n\nRegulatory  Monitoring  Officers  are  responsible  for monitoring,  analyzing  and  informing  operational staff  of  any  regulatory  changes  impacting  RCI Banque as part of the compliance control system put in place to ensure good corporate governance.",

The risks presented in chapter 2.1.6 'Extra-financial performance' of this Document have been included in this analysis. Depending on their materiality, they fed into the description of certain risk factors. This is the case, for example, with risks related to global warming, the protection of personal data or supplier relations.\n\nHowever, it cannot be ruled out that other risk factors currently considered insignificant or not identified could adversely affect Renault Group in the future. Also, possible changes in the group's medium-term strategic plan could result in changes in the nature or relative importance of risk factors. It should be noted that the major risk mapping is  updated  every  year,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  preparatory  work  and  implementation  of  the strategic plan, so that the plan integrates the appropriate action plans designed to respond to the operational or strategic risks identified.\n\nThe major risk factors resulting from the group's analysis for all of its operating segments are summarized in the following table and presented below with their own level of criticality. In each of the five categories, risk factors with the higher criticality levels are described at the beginning. These same major risk factors are then presented in a two-dimensional matrix (impact and probability of occurrence).",

The increasing use of certain raw materials necessary for the production of electric vehicles, such as cobalt or lithium, may also create tensions.",

These risks are analyzed  especially  in  the  context  of  investment requests and the building maintenance strategy.\n- \u25cf The  impact  of  global  warming  on  the  supply  and extraction of certain raw materials is also integrated into the monitoring of the risk of supply chain disruption (see paragraph on raw materials).\n- \u25cf In the  longer  term,  climate  change  is  also  a component of the risks associated with geopolitical instability and economic conditions.\n\nIn  addition,  these  risks  are  monitored  in  the  overall governance of sustainable development, environment and climate described in chapter 2.1.6.2, 'Risk  Mapping  (EFPD-B)'  of  this  Document,  and actions  are  implemented  across  the  board,  such  as the  launch  in  2022  of  a  comprehensive  study  of  the vulnerability  of  our  industrial  and  logistics  sites  to extreme climate scenarios.\n\n## Risk of insufficient response to disruption of existing activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  proportion  of  business  carried  out  by  digital means  is  steadily  increasing  and  could  lead  to  the disruption of existing activities by favoring disintermediation through the arrival of new players attracted  by  the  direct  contact  with  customers. This trend is emerging not only in businesses linked to new  mobility  (car-sharing,  connected  services,  etc.) but also in existing and traditional sectors of the sale of automotive  services  or  products,  sales  and after-sales, used  vehicles  and  sales  financing, which represent a significant part of our profitability (the  contribution  of  the  Sales  Financing  operating segment (RCI Banque) to Renault Group's consolidated net income was a profit of \u20ac789 million in 2020).\n\nThe  different  forms  of  lockdown  related  to  the COVID-19  pandemic  have  only  reinforced  this. The risks for Renault Group are:\n\n- \u25cf part of its business or value chain may be captured by  these  new  players  (which  may  come  from  the world of technology), positioning themselves between Renault Group and its customers;\n- \u25cf part  of  its  customer  base  may  be  lost  to  innovative players taking advantage  of  new  opportunities (opened  up  by  regulations,  for  example,  such  as  the forced  push  for  fleet  electrification  in  Europe)  and/or distributing their products without a dealer network.\n\nRisk and control\n\n## Risk management\n\nRenault  Group  has  always  paid  close  attention  to customer  relations,  whether  directly,  in  partnership with its dealer network or through its subsidiary RCI Banque, which has direct and regular contact with its customers. Each of the group's four brands focuses on value creation and concentrates its resources on the  associated  market  segments  and  customer expectations.\n\nSpecific action plans are being implemented by both the  upstream  business  lines  (product,  engineering, purchasing, logistics and industry) to offer competitive products and the downstream business lines (sales and after-sales, RCI Banque and Mobilize) to offer competitive services and distribution and to reduce  the  risk  of  disintermediation  in  the  medium term.  The  aim  is  to  propose  innovative  offers  to customers, including new mobility services in order to increase  contact  with  customers  throughout  the vehicle's life cycle.\n\nRenault Group is also pursuing its digital transformation, notably through its subsidiary Renault Digital, in order to develop the agile tools and organizations needed to be competitive.\n\n## Risk of insufficient capacity to develop new businesses\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAgainst  a  background  of  deep  and  sustained transformation in demand and the mobility offerings, in line with societal changes and environmental and climate issues, Renault Group could be faced with an inadequate  ability,  within  a  given  time  frame,  to change its business model, to anticipate and adapt to  changes  and  possible  disruptions  of  markets, mobility offers and related value chains, and thus to develop  new  business.  This  could  lead  to  lower revenues  than  the  objectives  for  the  affected portions  of  the  group's  commercial  offering,  as  a result  of  a  lack  of  innovation  and  inadequate preparation for its future, beyond the deadlines of the current strategic plan.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe group's strategic plan aims to make this risk an opportunity  by  mobilizing  (if  necessary  through  the use of new organizations) the resources of the group, the Alliance, RCI Banque, targeted partnerships and acquisitions, so as to structure  a  strong  and innovative  sustainable,  electric,  autonomous  and connected  mobility  offer.  These  innovative  service offerings  will  be  housed  within  the  automotive brands,  but  also  within  the  Mobilize  Business  Unit, whose scope goes beyond the traditional framework. The  decision  to  create  this  Business  Unit  in  2020 paves the way for the future: Renault Group is aiming to  derive  more  than  20%  of  its  revenues  from  new businesses by 2030.\n\nI\n\n04",

This concept will be developed in other group entities such as in Seville, Spain (announcement of 5 November 2021). In April 2021, Renault Group joined forces with Atos, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, STMicroelectronics  and  Thales  to  create  'Software R\u00e9publique':  a  new  open  ecosystem  for  intelligent and sustainable mobility. Its aim is to jointly develop and market intelligent mobility systems, enabling an adapted and agile mobility offer. Three main areas of cooperation have been identified: intelligent systems  to  facilitate  secure  connectivity  between the vehicle and its digital and physical environment, simulation and  data  management  systems  to optimize flows for territories and businesses, and the energy ecosystem to simplify the charging experience.\n\n## Risk of inadequate performance by the Alliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  Group's  membership  in  the  Renault-NissanMitsubishi Alliance makes a major contribution to the success  of  the  group  and  its  strategic  plan.  In  the market context of  the  health  crisis  and  difficulties  in the supply of semiconductors and in the deteriorated financial  performance  of  its  members,  the  Alliance's companies have focused their strategy on efficiency and  the  unit  profitability  of  vehicles  rather  than  on volumes. This situation,  in  the  context  of  the  Alliance governance  in  place  since  March  2019  (see  chapter 1.2.3 of this Document), could result in, through a lack of prioritization, a risk of insufficient performance due to less sharing within the Alliance of platforms, technologies  and,  more  generally,  the  investments necessary  for  the  development  of  product  ranges, which would jeopardize the future competitiveness of the  group's  offering  and  the  achievement  of  its revenues  and  earnings  targets.  This  risk  is  also assessed in terms of reputation: insufficient cooperation between the Alliance partners, in view of the  potential  and  expectations  of  the  market,  could result in a loss of confidence and a reduced ability for the  group  to  attract  some  of  its  stakeholders  and could negatively impact its development. The product cycle  and  the  transition  towards  the  end  of  diesel could  also  result  in  a  decline  in  business  volumes between Nissan and Renault. Lastly, Nissan's financial position could limit the distribution of dividends to the group for this year, as was the case in 2020.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  Alliance  Operating  Board  (AOB),  created  on 12 March  2019, is responsible for operational coordination between Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors and for new initiatives creating value for their respective shareholders and employees. On May 27, 2020,  the  Alliance  announced  the  new  'leader/ follower'  cooperation  business  model  in  order  to improve  the  competitiveness  and  profitability  of  its three member companies. Alliance members ensure they  are  always  at  the  forefront  of  the  industry  in terms  of  their  performance,  products,  technologies and  markets,  while  continuing  to  benefit  from  joint purchasing  and  development.  In  mid-2021,  three 'Alliance  Strategy  Days'  were  organized  within  the framework  of  the  AOB  meetings  to  take  stock  of ongoing  projects,  propose  new  opportunities  and ensure the development of synergies.\n\nOn  January  27,  2022,  the  members  of  the  Alliance announced  their  actions  and  projects  to  build  their joint future by 2030, with a focus on the new mobility value chain.\n\nFrom  2022,  as  an  illustration  of  this  joint  work, Megane  E-TECH  will  be  launched  on  the  CMF-EV common platform also used by Nissan Ariya. Megane E-TECH will also be launching GAS (Google Automotive Services) based on a common electronic architecture, a world first for a mass-market carmaker, which will be extended more widely across all ranges in the years to come.\n\nFor  2030,  on  the  basis  of  its  solid  foundations,  the Alliance  has  set  out  a  joint  roadmap  dedicated  to electric vehicles and smart, connected mobility. It is based  on  sharing  investments  for  the  benefit  of  its three members  and  their customers. It has announced an investment of \u20ac23 billion in electrification over the next five years, added to the \u20ac10 billion already spent in this area. By 2030, 35 new electric vehicle models will be offered to customers, and  90%  of  them  will  be  based  on  five  common electric  platforms.  This  electrical  plan  is  also  based on  a  shared  strategy  for  batteries.  In  the  area  of intelligent  and  connected mobility, the Alliance also shares a common  strategy that involves a centralized  electrical  and  electronic  architecture. The  Alliance  will  thus  launch  its  first  full  software defined  vehicle  by  2025,  which  will  bring  greater added value to customers, in particular by integrating  the  car  into  their  digital  ecosystem  to provide a personalized experience, offer new, improved  services  and  reduce  maintenance  costs, and will also increase the resale value of vehicle.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.2 Risks related to operations\n\n## Risk of supply chain disruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group's business relies on a complex system of  supply  and  delivery  chains,  both  upstream  and downstream  of  its  production  facilities.  Various components of these supply chains may prove to be defective,  despite  the  existing  control  system,  the characteristics  and  strengthening  of  which  are described  below.  Such  breakdowns  could  lead  to technical,  planning  or  economic  inefficiencies,  or even  interruptions  in  vehicle  production,  transport and/or  delivery  to  distribution  networks  and  endcustomers,  with  negative  consequences  for  the group's sales, revenues, profits or customer satisfaction.  These  potential  disruptions  may  be either internal -due in particular to the interdependence  underlying  the  group's  industrial network  (see  chapter  1.1.4 'Strategy' or 1.1.5.3 'Business-to-Business  Powertrain  activity'  of  this Document)  -  or  external,  as  seen  in  the  COVID-19 health crisis or the semiconductor supply crisis, and can be analyzed according to the following typology:\n\n- \u25cf supplier failure;\n- \u25cf disruption in supply or transport systems;\n- \u25cf disruption in supply of raw materials.\n\n## Supplier failure\n\nRenault  Group  relies  on  a  Tier  1  supplier  base comprising more than 800 parts supplier groups and more  than  400  service  providers,  with  which  it maintains  significant  business  relationships.  These suppliers may present risks of disruption in the design and production of compliant quality parts, in meeting delivery deadlines, in providing the necessary production  capacity  and  in  the  financial,  strategic, industrial,  social  and  management,  supply  chain, sustainable development and compliance fields.\n\nDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the semiconductor crisis, rising energy and raw material costs,  and  the  accelerating  decline  in  internal combustion engines, 2021 saw a further weakening of the  supplier  base  in  all  countries  where  Renault Group is present. These factors have contributed to the significant increase in the number of suppliers at risk.  This  proportion,  usually  between  5%  and  10%, was in  the  range  of  20%  to  25%  at  the  end  of  2021, with a significant proportion of suppliers potentially defaulting within one year.\n\nAs  could  be  expected,  the  implementation  of  support measures for industry in all countries around the world and  in  particular  in  France,  such  as  State-guaranteed loans  (PGE)  and  coverage  of  tax  and  social  security expenses, that had enabled the supplier base to avoid suffering from multiple disruptions and domino effects\n\ndoes not seem to have been of a nature to bring about a lasting  reinforcement  of  the  financial  structure  and durability  of  the  supplier  base.  The  supplier  base  has increased its debt, which makes it more vulnerable over the long term. These measures, which for the most part ended in 2021 in all countries, may have masked certain difficulties, leading to the expectation that the number of business failures will increase in 2022.\n\n2021  also  saw  confirmation  of  disruptions  in  the supply chain of electronic components and production interruptions. These disruptions took the form  of  periods  of  supplier  production  shutdowns and partial activity. For Renault Group, the impact on 2021  as  a  whole  has  been  estimated  at  a  loss  of production  of around  500,000  vehicles.  These interruptions were compounded by increases in raw material  and  energy  costs  and  an  ongoing  limited commitment  of  the  banking  system  to  finance  the automotive  industry.  As  indicated  ,these  factors could have an impact weakening the sector in 2022.\n\nIn  addition,  announcements  related  to  the  energy transition, including a complete halt to the release of internal  combustion  engine  vehicles  on  the  market within  the  European  Union  in  2035,  have  led  to anticipatory  behavior  on  the  part  of  suppliers  and their  customers.  This  behavior  could  result  in  a reduction  in  the  number  of  suppliers  as  well  as  a necessary restructuring of those whose trades will be impacted (especially in foundry, forging,  machining, etc.). It is therefore the entire supplier base that must be considered carefully over the next 15 years.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe group applies a comprehensive risk management system based on various measures:\n\n- \u25cf a  prevention  policy  designed  to  make  suppliers accountable  for  their  own  risks  and  in  particular  the compliance and robustness of their own supply chain;\n- \u25cf use of Alliance standards for products in development by suppliers;\n- \u25cf an  Alliance  capacity  reference  system  process aimed at controlling, within a two-year time frame, supply  risks  not  covered  by  the  existence  of available industrial capacities;\n- \u25cf an  Alliance  process  for  detecting  non-compliance (quality, traceability) of parts delivered;\n- \u25cf monitoring  of  intrinsic  supplier  risks:  annual  multicriterion ratings, financial and default risks (Alliance grid);\n- \u25cf monitoring of the risks created by the relationship between Renault Group (or other customers) and its suppliers  by  analyzing  indicators  such  as  (i)  the proportion  represented  by  Renault  Group  or  the main customer in revenues, (ii) the market share of the supplier in the group's panel, and (iii) the range's exposure to individual failure. Vigilance is especially\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

In particular, the initiation of the supplier risk analysis project beyond Tier 1 suppliers should be noted;\n- \u25cf the implementation of risk control measures with a greater  degree  of  anticipation  than  in  previous processes,  which  can  be  up  to  two  years  of anticipation;\n- \u25cf consideration  of  supplier  risk  on  comprehensive parameters from the outset of processing, including  industrial,  engineering,  financial,  human, etc. aspects.\n\nThe  prevention  policy  concerns  both  risks  under human control such as those listed, and risks outside human  control  (natural  disasters  for  example). Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi thus have a business continuity plan program.\n\nRenault  Group  will  continue  to  implement  and optimize  all  these  processes  during  2022  to  limit  the impact  and  consequences  of  semiconductor  supply disruptions.  At  the  beginning  of  2022,  Renault  Group estimates the impact of these disruptions at a loss of production of around 300,000 vehicles for the full year.\n\n## Disruption of supply or transport systems\n\nThe  risks  identified  relate  to  planning,  production, transport or delivery interruptions of parts, upstream of  vehicle  production  sites,  or  vehicles,  downstream of  these  sites,  which  could  impact  sales,  revenues, profits of the group or customer satisfaction. Among these  risks,  we  are  seeing  a  steady  increase  in cybersecurity risk among our logistics suppliers.\n\nThese risks, which are assessed in the dual context of the interdependence  of  the  group's industrial network  extended  to  its  global  suppliers  and  the footprint of the distribution network (in particular, see chapter  1.1.5.4  of  this  Document),  are  subject  to  a comprehensive  prevention  and  protection  system whose robustness is constantly being strengthened.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis  has  demonstrated  the  ability  of the supply chain to operate in a short loop to be more responsive  to  fluctuations in the environment. The commercial demand versus industrial response balancing process was able to operate efficiently on a weekly rather than monthly basis. This experience has  enabled  us  to  confirm  the  effectiveness  of  our digital tools, to improve their scope and to build new\n\nones.  The  supply  chain  crisis  management  system, which has been in place for many years, is the central tool for responding  to occasional crises and contingencies  (border  blockages,  blocking  of  the Suez  Canal,  weather  crises,  shortage  of  means  of transport, cybersecurity, etc.). The supply chain also actively contributed to the multi-trade groups for the assessment and resolution of risks during the crises involving electronic components,  plastics,  steel and others.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  supply  chain  is  continuing  its 'Control  Tower'  program.  Through  the  roll-out  of digital  processes  and  with  an  end-to-end  vision,  it aims to manage risks at the appropriate levels of the organizations  and  to  apply  consistent  methods between  the  group's  various  regions  and  business lines. The program, which covers the risks of supplier failures  as  well  as  within  the  supply  and  transport system, aims to:\n\n- \u25cf detect  demand  through  an  integrated  sales  and operational planning process: measurement of the impact of supplier disruption on vehicle diversity;\n- \u25cf manage  supply  capacity  and  supplier  failures:  a collaborative  platform  pilot  with  Tier  n  suppliers was launched in late 2021. The initial findings will be made available in 2022;\n- \u25cf manage  the  logistics  capacities  of  transporters, warehouses  and  fleets:  deployment  of  the  parts flow traceability project;\n- \u25cf anticipate risks.\n\nThe results of a cybersecurity audit of the procurement  systems  launched  at  the  end  of  2021 should be available in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Disruption in supply of raw materials\n\nThe  risks identified relate to potential supply restrictions (imbalance between supply and demand, sourcing issues, geopolitical disturbances), prices of raw materials, which can fluctuate significantly and suddenly, and non-compliance with ESG (environmental,  social  and  governance)  criteria. Purchases of raw materials account for approximately  one  third  of  the  total  purchasing budget. Three quarters of such raw  material purchases  are  deemed  strategic  because  they  are liable  to  have  a  significant  impact  on  production conditions or are experiencing significant imbalances  between  supply  and  demand.  Also  in 2021, as was the case in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted  in  difficulties  related  to  the  production  or extraction of materials due to lockdown measures or a  shortage  of  personnel  or  difficulties  in  adapting material production capacity to the uncertainties of demand. The decline in demand for cars has had a downward  impact  on  the  materials  used  mainly  in the automotive industry (e.g. rhodium).\n\nMeasures  implemented  by  the  company  with  its suppliers made it possible to avoid any major impact.",

The group is also reinforcing the control of materials contained  in  parts  and  components through  a  panel  of  approved  materials  and  the performance of detailed analysis of material prices in the costing of parts.\n\nIn  terms  of  technical  policies,  the  group  is  actively working  to  reduce  the  use  of,  or  to  substitute, sensitive materials (e.g. palladium, rhodium and rare earths).  It  continues  to  also  develop  the  use  of recycled  materials  (precious  metals  in  particular) and the recycling of end-of-life vehicles. The new ReFactory project in Flins  announced on 25 November 2020 is a further step in this direction.\n\nWith  regard  to  strategic  materials  for  batteries,  the group  wants  to  secure  the  supply  of  responsible materials  and  share  control  of  the  value  chain  with the  players  in  the  chain.  With  this  in  mind,  a  first agreement  for  the  supply  of  decarbonized  lithium was  signed  with  Vulcan  Energy.  Other  agreements are under discussion.\n\nIn a forward-looking approach, the group reassesses its  forecasts  on  a  bi-monthly  basis  for  the  main indexed and non-indexed items. At the same time, it ensures  ongoing  monitoring  of  critical  materials markets and suppliers.\n\nFinally,  to  reduce  risks  and  limit  exposure  to  market fluctuations,  Renault  Group  negotiates  annual  raw materials  supply  contracts  whenever  possible  and appropriate.  A  systematic  hedging  policy  has  been put in place for the main indexed commodities.\n\n## Risks related to geopolitical instability and economic conditions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault Group  has  industrial and commercial operations  in  a  large  number  of  countries  (see chapters 1.1.3, 1.1.5 and 1.1.9 of this Document). Some of these countries may present specific risks that could have an adverse impact on the group's industrial and commercial  operations,  sales,  revenues,  income statement or balance sheet, despite a geographical spread  of  sales  that  limits  the  overall  impact  of\n\nRisk and control\n\nregional  contingencies  while  taking  advantage  of opportunities.  These  risks  and  opportunities  may relate  to  the  changing  economic  related  situations, political or regulatory instability, social unrest, protectionism,  nationalizations,  fluctuating  interest rates  and  exchange  rates,  lack  of  foreign  currency liquidity or foreign exchange control measures.\n\nSince  2020,  the  adverse  events  that  have  occurred are  mainly  health-related,  linked  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  its  consequences,  such  as  the numerous temporary closures of production units of Renault  Group  or  its  suppliers  or  the  shutdown  of certain  points  of  sale  in  contact  with  customers.  In 2021,  automotive  markets  were  also  impacted  by disruptions  in  the  supply  of  electronic  components and  raw  materials  as  well  as  insufficient  maritime transport from plants.\n\nThe health crisis and these supply chain disruptions continued to weaken the sector's economic situation. These disruptions were experienced in all markets by most automotive industry actors.\n\n## Specific risks\n\nThe  group's  activities  remain  heavily  dependent  on the  European  market,  which  in  2021  represented  a little  more  than  half  (53%)  of  the  group's  sales  (see the  group's  worldwide  sales  in  chapter  1.1.5.2  of  this Document and the breakdown of sales by country).\n\nOutside  Europe,  the  countries  or  areas  that  expose the  group most by their weight in sales and/or total production  are  Russia,  Morocco,  Turkey  and  the Americas.  The  respective  weights  in  the  group's vehicle sales and production are as follows for each of  these  countries  or  areas  (see  chapters  1.1.5.2  and 1.1.5.4  of  this  Document  for  sales  and  production figures for 2021): Russia (18%, 19%), Morocco (3%, 11%), Turkey (4%, 9%) and the Americas (10%, 10%).\n\nIn Russia, prior to the outbreak of the conflict in early 2022, the group has always endeavored to adapt its activities,  through  its  various  sites  and  via  the AVTOVAZ group, a major player in the local  market (see  chapter  1.1.5.1,  'LADA:  complete  transformation of  the  range  continues'  paragraph,  and  chapter 1.1.9.1.2,  'Detailed  organization  chart at December 31, 2021'),  to  fluctuations  in  the  economic  environment, which includes:\n\n- \u25cf risks related to the political and economic situation (economic sanctions  or  other  factors  of  instability resulting  in  changes  in  government  policy  in support of local integration and export assistance);\n- \u25cf risks related to changes in customs regulations;\n- \u25cf risks related to the situation of local suppliers.\n\nI\n\n04",

The  areas concerned  mainly  include  employee  safety,  the  risk factor of supply chain failure, production and business interruption  risk  in  Russia,  the  risk  of  inability  to finance  in  Russia,  and  the  risk  of  cyberattack  and information systems failure.\n\nAt its meeting on March 23, 2022, Renault's Board of Directors approved the decision of suspension of the activities  of  the  Moscow  plant  and  the  decision  of assessing the possible options regarding its stake in AVTOVAZ.  These  elements  and  the  impacts  on  the financial  outlook  are  detailed  in  chapter1.5  'Postclosing events' of this document.\n\nIn Turkey ,  Renault Group is exposed to geopolitical risk as well as to macroeconomic and regulatory instability. As  a  result,  the  market  is  highly  volatile,  leading  the group to implement a risk management policy aimed at combining the short-term adaptability of its production system and the preparation of alternative solutions for the main logistics flows.\n\nIn  Morocco ,  the  exposure  to  risk  of  non-transfer  on imports  is  limited  by  the  exported  production. The potential impact of regional tensions remains to be monitored.\n\nIn a volatile political and economic environment that has worsened with the global health crisis, the main countries  in  the Americas have  been  impacted  by exchange  rates  and  falling  GDP.  In  2021,  the restructuring of industrial capacity, the elimination of unprofitable sales and above-market price increases  offset  most  of  the  exogenous  impacts. However,  inflationary  pressures  remain  higher  in several  countries,  notably Argentina , where  the situation  remains  worrying,  and Brazil , where  the Central  Bank  revised  its  2021  inflation  forecasts upwards  and  began  a  fifth  increase  in  its  key  rate (SELIC) in September to 6.25% (an increase of 425 bp since  March).  In  this  weakened  economic  context, sociopolitical risk remains significant.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn terms  of  industrial  location,  Renault  Group's geographical choices are made taking into account the  risks  of  instability  built  into  a  global  industrial approach  in  order  to  ensure  risk  diversification. Manufacturing investments represent a major part of the  group's  exposure  to  political  risks.  Country  risk related to manufacturing and financial investment is in principle not  hedged,  but  the  risk  of  non-\n\nachievement  of  objectives is included in the expected profitability calculation. From an operational standpoint, the group  continuously increases  the  level  of  local  integration  in  order  to reduce the impact of political and foreign exchange risks and make its products more competitive.\n\nIn addition, the group hedges against the risk of nonpayment  for  most  payments  originating  from  highrisk  countries.  The  main  exceptions  relate  to  intragroup  sales,  sales  to  industrial  partners  and  to countries  for  which  there  is  no  possible  hedging. Residual country risk is regularly monitored.\n\nIn order to centrally manage the risk of non-payment and  put  in  place  hedges  on  competitive  terms,  the group  has  designed  a  'hub  and  spoke'  invoicing system. Manufacturing subsidiaries sell their exported production to Renault s.a.s, which sells it on to commercial subsidiaries and independent importers, granting them supplier credit. The associated risk is managed by the parent company. Some sales between countries covered by customs agreements do not use this system, however.\n\nWith regard to the economic situation related to the consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  Renault Group continued in 2021 to coordinate and manage, as  closely  as  possible  to  the  ground  and  taking  a cross-functional approach, the reactions to be put in place  within  the  company  with  suppliers  upstream and  with  the  network  and  customers  downstream. Also in 2021, Renault Group continued to reduce fixed costs and restructure industrial capacity to lower the company's break-even point, eliminated unprofitable sales  and  worked  on  prices  (net  pricing)  to  offset most of the exogenous impacts. These developments  were  a  key  asset  in  managing  the market and production changes associated with the 2021  supply  disruptions.  This  flexibility  in  closely shadowing market evolution is paramount in Renault Group's  strategy  in  order  to  protect  employees, optimize financial performance and seize all possible opportunities.\n\nSince  February  2022,  the  conflict  in  Ukraine  and  its consequences  on  the  group's  business  have  been continuously monitored with all the teams concerned,  primarily  to  guarantee  the  physical integrity and safety of employees. Renault Group has endeavored  to  analyze,  as  soon  as  they  are published,  the  consequences  of  the  economic  and financial sanctions and counter-sanctions gradually decided  upon  and  ensures  strict  compliance  with them in the context of its activities. The impacts are assessed  and  the  necessary  corrective  actions implemented on a day-to-day basis by a dedicated multi-business crisis unit. At its meeting of March 23, 2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  recorded  additional information,  set  out  in  chapter  1.5  'Post-closing events' of this document.",

Despite  internal  control  systems, installed production capacities are greater than the volumes  sold,  product  costs  have  ballooned  under the  effect  of  regulations  and  technological  choices that are not financially efficient enough to offset this increase,  and  overall  profitability  suffers  from  the group's  exposure  to  unprofitable  countries  and reduced presence in profitable segments such as the C and C+ segments.\n\nRapid  changes  in  the  competitive  environment  and unpredictable  inflation  in  the  purchase  prices  of  raw materials  and  components  and  their  availability  -  as illustrated by the ongoing electronic components crisis -  could  result  in  an  inability  to  restore  the  operational performance  needed  to  finance  investments  in  the Renaulution medium-term strategic plan.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn  the  Renaulution  plan  announced  on  14  January 2021, cost-cutting targets were strengthened. The  '2022  plan'  announced  in  May  2020,  which targeted a reduction of more than \u20ac2 billion in fixed expenses over three years compared with 2019, has been  accelerated  and  extended  to  \u20ac2.5  billion  by 2023, with a target of \u20ac3 billion by 2025. The plan also provides for a reduction in variable expenses of \u20ac600 per vehicle by 2023. Special 'Turnaround' governance  has  been  in  place  since  autumn  2020; the four pillars of profitability (variable costs, revenues,  fixed  costs  and  working  capital)  form  its scope of action and decision, and performance and steering reviews are held every week.\n\nThe results for 2021 (operating margin of 3.6% for the group,  Automotive  operating  free  cash  flow  before changes  in  working  capital  at  \u20ac1.3  billion)  validated the  first  stage  of  the  turnaround.  Explanations  for these  results  include  the  achievement  of  the  first phase of the plan to reduce fixed costs by \u20ac2 billion by 2019, a year  ahead  of  schedule,  and  the implementation of the new commercial policy of the 'Renaulution' strategic plan.\n\n## Risk of natural, health or industrial disasters\n\nThe  group's  operating  sites,  whether  manufacturing sites, engineering  and  testing  centres,  logistics platforms or even commercial sites are exposed to the risk  of  industrial  accidents,  fires,  explosions  and machine breakdowns. In addition, some facilities (see in particular chapter 1.1.5.4 of this Document presenting the main industrial sites) are subject to the risk  of  natural  disasters:  earthquakes  (particularly  in Chile, Turkey, Romania,  Colombia,  Slovenia  and Morocco), as well as floods or submersions (particularly in France and Korea), with the latter risks being  increased  by  the  higher  frequency  of  external climate events related to global warming.\n\nThe  occurrence  of  any  of  these  risks,  despite  the prevention  and  resilience  policies  presented  below, could  harm  people,  the  environment  or  the  sites concerned  and  lead  to  significant  disruptions  in  the ability to operate affected sites - potentially damaging the  group's  assets  and/or  overall  performance  (sales, revenues, income statement or balance sheet), particularly through industrial interdependencies.\n\nA  global  pandemic,  such  as  the  current  COVID-19 pandemic, can result in significant and shifting health threats  in  countries  where  the  group  operates.  Such situations may  be  accompanied  by  measures imposing restrictions on the free movement of people and  goods,  disrupting  the  opening  of  sales  or  aftersales outlets in distribution networks and the smooth running  of  industrial  sites.  The  main  impacts  of  such situations  would  be  on  the  health  and  availability  of the group's personnel and its suppliers, as well as on financial performance (revenues, cash flow and cash) and,  potentially,  the  value  of  certain  balance  sheet assets. In addition to the direct impact on people and business,  the  pandemic  has  collateral  effects  on  the organization of logistics flows and supplies worldwide.\n\n## Risk management\n\nOver  the  past  30  years,  Renault  Group  has  been committed  to  implementing  and  developing  an ambitious  and  rigorous  prevention  policy  (safety  of people,  property  and  business  continuity).  Excluding AVTOVAZ,  more  than  93%  of  the  assets  (industry, engineering  and  logistics)  covered  by  the  'property damage and business interruption' insurance program were awarded the international 'Highly Protected Risk (HPR)' label in 2021, which reflects a level of prevention and protection approved by insurance companies. And in a convergent  approach,  the  AVTOVAZ  group implements fire protection and safety measures on its sites,  including  insurance  against  any  risks  related  to the operation of industrial facilities.\n\nI\n\nRisk and control\n\n04",

In particular, a specific multi-year plan is being rolled out  to  optimize  the  treatment  of  seismic  risk  at  the sites  concerned:  reinforcement  of  buildings  and facilities, staff training, specific means of communication, crisis management systems, business  continuity  and  an  appropriate  insurance program.  In  2021,  reinforcements  were  finalized  in Chile and Turkey and are continuing in Romania.\n\nWith regard to the health crisis, Renault Group has put in place permanent measures to protect the health of its employees, in conjunction with the public authorities,  to  preserve  its  assets  and  its  ability  to operate  and  to  adapt  to  changing  situations  in  the various  countries.  An  ongoing  monitoring  system makes it possible to track the evolution of the situation and to mobilize the crisis mechanism if necessary. The provisions mainly concern specific work organization, management of work interruptions  and  resumptions in line with local measures and commercial demand.\n\n## Social risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  an  unstable  economic,  environmental  and  health context,  major  changes are putting pressure on the company's activity. In this situation, the Renaulution strategic plan entails a transformation that will lead to  changes  in  the  organization  and  new  business models.  Energy  transition  issues  and  aggravating external  factors  such  as  the  shortage  of  electronic components and rising prices of raw materials could lead  the  group  to  take  measures  relating  to  the employment conditions of its people. In addition, an increase in inflation in countries where Renault Group has significant operations could lead to pressure on costs at the local level.\n\nIn  this  environment, the group runs the risk of being confronted  with  social  movements  in  the  countries where it operates, which could disrupt its activities.\n\n## Risk management\n\nBuilding on its Global Framework Agreements of 2013 and  2019,  Renault  Group  has  a  dynamic  of  social dialogue  both  at  the  global  level  through  its  Group Works  Council  and  at  the  local  level  with  employee representative  bodies.  Renault  Group  is  committed to  dealing  with  these  changes  and  the  associated risks  through  regular,  qualitative  social  dialogue, allowing global and local agreements to be reached where necessary.\n\n## 4.2.3 Risks related to products and services\n\n## Risk of inadequate definition, product and service delivery or innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the fast-changing environment of the automotive markets, regulations, market trends, customer expectations  and  technologies,  linked  to  societal, environmental  and  climate  issues,  Renault  Group  is exposed to a risk of an insufficient match between its capacity  for  innovation,  its  product  and  services offering and the expectations of the various markets, which could  adversely  impact  its  sales,  revenues  or income statement.\n\nSpecific risks have been identified relating to:\n\n- \u25cf enhancement  of  the  technological  content  of vehicles  and  related  ecosystems,  especially  with regard to vehicle connectivity and related services and  the  development  of  electrified  and,  in  the longer term, autonomous vehicles and in the fields of electronics  and  software  (see  chapter  1.3.1 'Technologies of the future' of this Document);\n- \u25cf continual increases in the cost of vehicles resulting from  more  stringent  regulations  (e.g.  Euro  7 regulations  -  see  chapter  1.4.1),  the  accounting  of\n\nwhich  through  corrective  changes  in  sale  prices could  prove  excessively  difficult,  thus  weakening the  economic  balance  and  the  future  of  certain products;\n\n- \u25cf the  specific  and  strong  ambition  of  the  group  with respect  to  electric  vehicles  in  a  context  of  intense, complex  industrial  and  market  dynamics  with uncertain  timings,  in  particular  conditioned  by  the development  of  ecosystems  (charging,  battery recycling) and by regional regulations (for example, CAFE  in  Europe  -  see  chapter  1.4.1.2  'Pollutant emissions and CO2'), and increasingly skewed by aid policies  or  restrictions  at  all  levels  (region,  country, city) and in many forms (traffic restrictions or bans);\n- \u25cf the current transition of the powertrain offer, in terms of technologies (petrol, diesel, electrical hybridization of internal combustion engines, electrical) and mix. In particular,  the  choice  of  hybridization  technology, which is particularly sensitive to costs and also offers differentiated customer and CO2 performance, could turn  out  to  be  imperfectly  adapted  or  paced, depending  on  the  products  and  markets,  thus potentially  going  against  the  overall  technological and financial optimization defined by the group for its CAFE trajectory;\n- \u25cf preserving  the  profitability  of  Renault  Group's investments  in  the  context  in  which  the  group",

This necessity  could  increase  the  risk  weighing  on  the choices made about innovations and the chances of seeing those innovations match real expectations of customers and therefore generate returns on investment.\n\nShould  the  reference  assumptions  used  in  the group's  product  development  decisions  be  strongly called into question, the group may have to recognize impairment on fixed assets (investment and capitalized development expenses, depreciated over the life of the vehicle) or book a provision to cover the contractual indemnities to be paid, if any, due to the failure to meet a minimum purchase volume.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe definition of the group's future products is based on  customer  studies  and  analyses  of  automotive competitors,  so  that  market  expectations  and developments and industry trends can be identified. It  is  also  increasingly informed, on a global scale, by anticipatory  technology  watch  by  all  of  the  group's development stakeholders, of the automotive industry  and  beyond.  The  development  of  new models or components is decided on the basis of this work and an evaluation of the anticipated profitability, calculated over the projected life cycle.\n\nRenault  Group  has  reviewed  the  definition  of  its entire product and technology development portfolio under  the  impetus  of  its  new  CEO  since  July  2020. A new organization by brand was set up in early 2021 to  ensure  that  it  was  as  close  as  possible  to consumers' expectations. Brand markers have been defined to ensure that product and service content is consistent  with  the  relative  positioning  of  each brand.  These  brands  are  able  to  make  the  most relevant choices and trade-offs in order to strengthen  their  specific  identities  and  can  rely  on the  expertise  of  the  central  business  lines  and  the bodies  and  technologies  developed  at  the  Alliance level or with partners (e.g. Google - see below).\n\nThe group can thus develop products that will offer all types  of  engines  (petrol,  diesel,  electric  and electrified,  LPG,  hydrogen),  increased  connectivity for  its  vehicles  and  the  driving  aids  expected  by  its customers. For example:\n\n- \u25cf at the end of 2020, the company launched a major innovation  on  the  hybridization  market  with  the E-TECH hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines, which, in\n\naddition  to  the  electric  range,  make  it  possible  to meet CAFE regulatory requirements;\n\n- \u25cf in addition,  Megane  E-TECH  will  be  the  first consumer vehicle to be integrated into the Google automotive platform;\n- \u25cf in the  key  area  of  battery  technologies,  the roadmap presented during the 'RENAULT E-Ways' event  on  30  June  2021  highlighted  the  desire  to locate  battery  sourcing  as  close  as  possible  to plants, the choice of a dual offer through partnerships  with  Envision  AESC  for  a  costcompetitive  battery  as  well  as  with  the  start-up Verkor  for  a  high-performance  battery,  and  lastly the design of a standardized cell architecture able to reduce  manufacturing  costs  and  increase battery energy efficiency.\n\nFrom a general perspective, to ensure the robustness of the product plan and keep risks under control, the group strives to:\n\n- \u25cf maximize  the  distribution  of  the  same  model  in different  markets,  which  reduces  its  exposure  to possible fluctuations in one of these markets;\n- \u25cf optimize outlay by simultaneously developing cars in the same segment for several brands, combining strong design differentiation and maximum technical commonality;\n- \u25cf offer  a  varied,  balanced  product  portfolio  that meets customer expectations in different segments and markets, so as to reduce the risk of dependency  on  a  single  market,  segment  or customer type;\n- \u25cf offer  a  diversified  and  adaptable  engine  portfolio (ICE,  LPG,  hybrid,  plug-in  hybrid,  electric,  hydrogen) to meet customer expectations in different markets and enable potential changes in the engine mix to be supported;\n- \u25cf develop, with its Alliance partners, a limited number of  standardized  technical  platforms  (e.g.  CMF-EV) to  maximize  economies  of  scale  for  component volumes  and  costs  and  facilitate  their  reuse  from one region to another;\n- \u25cf control the robustness of main product development milestones so as to secure the market launch  schedule  of  new  products,  in  particular  by strengthening  governance  through  the  increased involvement  of  top  management.  The  upstream phases are thus now more robust due to their level of detail, their 360\u00b0 business vision and a handover from  the  'Concept  Freeze'  milestone  to  the company's brands and downstream.\n\nI\n\n04",

Developments  in  the  group's  strategy  and  its  new challenges (cloud strategy, digitization,  Industry  4.0, development of connected services or strengthening of the  cybersecurity  regulatory  environment  in particular)  are  tending  to  increase  its  exposure  to threats and making cybersecurity a major challenge.\n\nThe  main  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  its activities, its systems,  or  those  associated  with connected services offered to its customers as part of the group's product and service offer, are related to:\n\n- \u25cf cybercrime: global computerized attacks or attacks targeting  the  group's  interests  or,  as  a  side  effect, national  interests.  These  attacks,  in  a  context  of strong  growth,  may  aim  to  access  sensitive  data (strategic,  product,  service  or  personal  data),  to steal or alter them, to block services or even all of the group's information systems;\n- \u25cf incidents  that  could  affect  the  continuity  of services hosted in our infrastructures and those of our partners and suppliers;\n- \u25cf non-compliance  with  IT  standards  or  practices required  by  legislation,  external  authorities  or contracts with suppliers or the state of the art.\n\n## Risk management\n\nControl of this risk was enhanced by the launch of a specific  Customer  Satisfaction  plan.  It  relies  in particular on quality assurance systems implemented within the group's operating activities as  well  as  on  functional  safety  organization  and activities  and  general  product  safety,  aiming  to protect  against  the  risks  related  to  the  physical integrity of people involved in road use, starting with the users of the group's products and services.\n\nThe  group  has  also  set  up  a  market  monitoring system that allows it to become aware of sources of customer  dissatisfaction  very  quickly  and  to  act accordingly.  This  is  done  in  particular  through  such measures as enhanced recall  processes  in  order  to ensure the correction of quality problems, especially those that could have potential regulatory or safety consequences.\n\nThe  materialization  of  these  risks,  despite  the continuous  strengthening  of  systems  aimed  at controlling them, could have major financial impacts related  to  the  temporary  suspension  of  the  group's activities  -  of  all  types  -  (revenues,  earnings),  to penalties or to increased insurance premiums. There could also be adverse impacts on the group's image and the confidence of third parties and customers in the group and its brands.\n\nIn  addition,  Renault  Group's  increased  marketing  of connected  vehicles  and  services  (in  particular,  see chapters  1.3.1  and  1.3.2)  is  accompanied  by  the emergence of risks of a comparable nature, for which insufficiently  robust  and  sustainable  management could  lead  to  adverse  impacts  on  safety  and  the reliability of data, services or vehicles.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  general  control  of  these  risks  is  currently provided at the operational level via:\n\n- \u25cf the deployment of security policies (e.g. controlling information,  information  system  security,  vehicle cybersecurity management system, IT charter and IT code of conduct) and the continuous enhancement  of  the  process  of  defining  security requirements according to the level of criticality of the applications and data handled;\n- \u25cf the translation of policies into operational procedures;\n- \u25cf the deployment of an evolving action plan based on a security master plan and annual risk mapping. The security master plan was updated and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee (CAR) in 2021.",

In early 2022, Renault Group obtained official certification from UTAC for the management of its cybersecurity (CSMS);\n- \u25cf enhanced supervision (Security Operations Centre - SOC) of systems in all the group's domains (in  particular  IS/IT,  vehicles,  connected  services, cloud infrastructure and plants);\n- \u25cf strengthening  of  awareness,  training  and  skills regarding cybersecurity;\n- \u25cf strengthening  of  the  protection  of  the  group's systems/infrastructures  (including  those  that  use cloud hosting);\n- \u25cf participation in international and national ecosystem interest groups (e.g. PFA, Cyber Campus, ACEA). PFA, Cyber Campus, ACE).\n\n## Risk of ineffective digital transformation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2016,  the  group  initiated  a  digital  transformation that,  led  by  the  IT  function,  aims  to  allow  all  the Functions to improve their productivity, reduce their costs and change their way of working. This transformation involves both organizational and technical  changes,  and  poor  governance  of  these changes could lead to a loss of group efficiency and competitiveness.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRenault  Digital  was  created  in  January  2017  to  gain mastery of tools and methodologies related to Digital (architecture,  data,  Agile  methodology,  etc.)  and  to integrate the group's IT Department and then all the\n\nRisk and control\n\nFunctions.  In  April  2019,  the  CIO  was  appointed Executive Director and has since been a member of the  group's  Board  of  Management,  enabling  the Digital  Transformation  to  be  steered  at  the  highest level. Governance of the digital project portfolio has been  put  in  place,  together  with  oversight  of  the value  generated  by  Transformation  projects.  Lastly, the  evolution  of  governance  and  implementation methods  for  strategic  projects  is  entrusted  to Renault  Digital  to  steer  the  achievements  and measure the success of this transformation.\n\n## Risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations, including corruption\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a result of its international activities, Renault Group is subject  to  increasingly  numerous,  complex  and shifting  laws  and  regulations,  particularly  in  the  areas of automotive manufacturing, the environment, competition, labor law, new technologies and cybersecurity (in particular, see chapter 1.4 'Regulatory environment' of this Document).\n\nThe  group  could  therefore  find  itself  exposed  to  a change in laws or regulations that were insufficiently anticipated or incorrectly taken into account by the existing management  system  described  below. Moreover, the authorities or courts may also change the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations at any time.\n\nThese  differences  in  anticipation  or  failure  to account  for  such  changes  in  laws  or  regulations could result, for the group and its senior executives, in possible criminal, administrative or financial penalties,  that  could  also  lead,  for  the  group,  to  a change  in  its  capacity  to  carry  out  its  operating activities, its revenues, its profits or its image.\n\n## Risk management\n\nConcerning  such  legal  and  regulatory  changes, Renault  Group  requires  its  subsidiaries  to  comply with  the  regulations  of  the  countries  in  which  the company  conducts  its  business  and  takes  part  in ongoing  discussions  with  the  national  or  regional authorities in charge of the specific regulation of the products  in  the  automotive  sector,  in  order  to anticipate  changes  and  guarantee  compliance  of the group with laws and regulations.\n\nLikewise, Renault Group uses a structured approach to analyze  and  ensure  the  robustness  of  its regulatory compliance in a sustainable and proactive manner, within a scope of major regulated domains  including:  'competition',  'fight  against fraud and corruption', 'environment', 'occupational health, safety  &  work  environment',  'technical regulations' and 'data protection'.\n\nI\n\n04",

The maturity  of  the  regulatory  compliance  systems  is measured quarterly by an index, a summary of which is presented to the CEC.\n\n## Legal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenault  Group  is  exposed  to  a  legal  risk,  the assessment  and  potential  impacts  of  which  are detailed  below.  In  its  criticality  analysis,  the  group uses  an  overall  assessment  of  these  components, presented below in no particular order.\n\n## Litigation\n\nRenault  Group  is  unable  to  assess  the  impact  of ongoing litigation proceedings on the group.\n\nIn  general,  these  proceedings  could  result  in  the payment  of  fines  or  damages  that  could  have  a negative  impact  on  the  group's  operating  income and financial position. In this case, these proceedings could also have an effect on the group's reputation among  consumers  and  indirectly reduce the attractiveness of the vehicles that it markets.\n\n## Market monitoring\n\nLike any manufacturer, Renault Group is exposed to the  risk  of  non-compliance  of  the  products  that  it markets and their withdrawal from the market. In a context  of  particular  sensitivity  to  ecological  issues and the tightening of applicable regulations, this risk appears to be higher for internal combustion engine vehicles marketed by the group.\n\n## Intellectual property\n\nRenault  Group's  industrial  know-how,  innovations resulting  from  research  and  the  products  marketed are the subject of patents, trademarks, designs and models  filed  to  protect  the  group's  intellectual property.  As  such,  Renault  Group  files  a  significant number of patents, trademarks, designs and models in its area of activity each year (see chapter 1.3 of this Document).  The  major  risk  facing  Renault  Group  in terms of intellectual property is the risk of counterfeiting, whether innocent or deliberate.\n\nCounterfeiting  may  be  committed  by  third  parties against  the  products,  industrial  processes,  brands,\n\ndesigns and models protected by Renault Group. From a  technological  standpoint,  given  Renault  Group's reputation,  particularly  in  the  field  of  hybrid  and electric  vehicles,  the  group  could  become  a  prime target for such counterfeiting. Renault Group's E-TECH technology  is  a  significant  example.  As  regards trademarks,  designs  and  models,  repercussions  can be felt in particular in the replacement market. Renault Group's existing reputation is a key factor in increasing  the  risk  of  counterfeiting,  particularly  in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAny such actions could have an immediate unfavrable  impact  on  the  group's  revenues  and earnings,  and  may  harm  the  reputation  and  quality image of the technologies and products concerned. Patents, trademarks, designs and models registered by  Renault  Group  in  the  group's  main  automotive markets  provide  it  with  an  effective  weapon  in  the fight  against counterfeiting. In addition, with regard to trademarks, the establishment of customs monitoring in  various  countries  allows  the  reporting of dubious products, both imports and exports.\n\nSo-called  deliberate  counterfeiting  could  be  an involuntary  act  by  Renault  Group,  given  the  risk associated  with  the  period  during  which  patent applications are not made public. Patent applications filed by third parties and known only at the time of publication could force Renault Group to modify a product under development, increasing the project's  Research  and  Development  costs,  or  to negotiate  rights  to  use  the  patented  item.  In  either case,  the  project's  margin  would  be  affected.  This risk is particularly present in the context of connectivity and standard essential patents.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe control of legal risks is in particular based on an internal  control  system  organized  around  three guiding principles:\n\n- \u25cf Management of the group's legal function, which is organized around a central function and employees  in  the  group's  main  countries.  These employees report on a hierarchical and/or functional basis;\n- \u25cf Employees  of  the  legal  function  are  proactive  in anticipating legal risks upstream and adapting the corresponding procedures (advisory consultations, information from the central legal function, etc.);\n- \u25cf Regulatory monitoring by Renault Group in collaboration with the different countries concerned.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.5 Financial risks\n\nRenault  Group  is  exposed  to  the  following  six  main risk components of a financial nature, the assessment,  potential  impacts  and  principles  of control of which are specified below.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  international  expansion  of  its  activities  leaves the group exposed to foreign exchange risk. This risk is related to the fluctuation of the various currencies against  the  euro  and  mainly  impacts the  group's Automotive activity .\n\nThe  Automotive  segment  is  exposed  to  foreign exchange  risk  mainly  at  the  level  of  the  operating margin,  and  the  group  may  hedge  some  of  this exposure on an ad hoc basis. Based on the structure of  its  results  and  operating  cash  flows  for  2021,  an increase  of  1%  in  the  euro  against  all  currencies would have a negative impact of \u20ac20 million on the Automotive Division's annual operating margin after hedging (detailed impact by currency in Note 25-B2 of the financial statements).\n\nThe  P&L  statement,  the  share  in  the  result  of associated companies, shareholders' equity and the net  liquidity  position  may  also  be  impacted  by exchange  rate  fluctuations  against  the  euro.  In particular,  the  group  has  a  stake  of  43.7%  in  Nissan and  therefore  holds  a  net  asset  in  yen  whose fluctuations  impact  the  value  of  the  securities  in assets  and  the  group's  translation  reserves  in liabilities. For the 2021 financial year, the impact of a 1%  increase  in  the  euro  against  the  yen  would represent  a  reduction  of  153.7  millions  euros  in Nissan's contribution to group equity and a reduction of  3.8  millions  euros  in  the  group's  income  from associated companies (see notes 12-C and 25-B2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements).  In  addition, the group partially hedges the foreign exchange risk related to its investment in Nissan by issuing loans in Japanese yen, which impacts its net liquidity position. Thus,  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  the  yen  would increase the net liquidity position by \u20ac1.4 million.\n\nThe Sales  Financing  segment is  exposed,  to  a  more limited extent, to the risk of exchange  rate fluctuations, which may  nevertheless have a negative impact on its financial position.\n\nRisk and control\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  management  policy  for the Automotive segment is  deployed and monitored by the Performance and Control Department and the Financing and Treasury Department.\n\nAny hedging of foreign exchange risk in the operating margin must undergo prior analysis by the Performance and Control Department and the Financing  and  Treasury  Department  and  then  be formally  authorized  by  the  Finance  Department  or Senior Management, and the results are then reported monthly  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer.  Whenever possible, foreign exchange transactions are carried out by  the  group's  trading  room  (Renault  Finance)  for currencies traded on international markets.\n\nIn 2021, in order to limit the exposure of its operating margin  to  foreign  exchange  risk,  the  Automotive segment partially hedged its exposure to the pound sterling, the Argentinian peso, the Russian rouble, the Chinese yuan and the Turkish lira.\n\nIn  addition,  to  avoid  any  distortion  of  the  financial result  linked  to  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  the exchange  rate  risk  linked  to  financing  and  cash management flows in foreign currencies is systematically minimized. Cash surpluses in countries not centralized at the parent company are generally invested in local currency under the control of the Financing and Treasury Department. Financing  transactions  are  carried  out  in  the accounting currency of each entity, or when carried out  in  foreign  currencies,  are  hedged  in  the  same currency under the supervision of the Financing and Treasury Department. Any residual exposures (including  those  resulting  from  Renault  Finance operations)  are  subject  to  derogations  and  are reported monthly to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nEquity investments (in currencies other than the euro) are not usually hedged. This may lead to translation adjustments  recognized  in  group  equity.  However, given the size of the investment in Nissan, Renault's share  in  Nissan's  net  worth  has  been  partially covered  by  a  specific  foreign  exchange  hedge  (see note 12-G to the consolidated financial statements). To limit liquidity risks in yen, the group  has established a policy of not hedging  the  net investment  above  an  amount  equal  to  its  best estimate of the next three years' dividends in yen to be received from Nissan.\n\nI\n\n04",

With  regard  to  transactional  foreign  exchange  risk, most  Sales  Financing  subsidiaries  have  a  singlecurrency business and are therefore not exposed to foreign  exchange  risk.  However,  some  subsidiaries finance assets denominated in different currencies. Their  transactional  foreign  exchange  position  is subject to limits, and the residual exposure is kept at a marginal level for RCI Banque. At December 31, 2021, the  RCI  Banque  group's  consolidated  transactional foreign exchange position (excluding equity investments in subsidiaries) amounted to \u20ac4.2 million. RCI Banque also has long-term investments in many countries  outside  the  eurozone.  These  investments are  of  strategic  importance  to  RCI  Banque  and  are integrated into the group's risk management. They  generate  a  structural  exposure  to  foreign exchange  risk,  which  is  managed  with  two  main objectives:  (a)  to  protect  the  group's  consolidated capital  ratios  from  the  impacts  resulting  from changes in currency exchange rates and (b) to meet local  regulatory  requirements  in  terms  of  capital ratios  with  an  appropriate  buffer.  Open  positions may result in asset losses (equity write-downs) if the currency  in  question  depreciates.  RCI  Banque  has established  limits  on  the  maximum  loss  realized  by keeping these positions open.\n\nFor  further  details  on  the  management  of  foreign exchange  risk,  see  note  25-B2  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe group finances its Automotive  and  Sales Financing activities through the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper, bank loans and through the securitization of receivables and depositgathering activities. In the event of prolonged market\n\nclosures or pressure on access to credit, the group is exposed  to  liquidity  risk.  If  the  group's  funding requirements  increase  or  if  the  group  is  unable  to access  new  sources  of  funding,  insufficient  liquidity would be particularly detrimental to its competitiveness,  operating  results  and  financial position. Liquidity risk is the risk of the Automotive and Sales  Financing  segments  experiencing  reduced liquidity  to  repay  debts  as  they  fall  due  or  to  finance balance  sheet  growth.  The  group's  liquidity  could  be significantly  affected  by  factors  beyond  its  control, such  as  general  market  disruptions,  the  market's perception  of  increased  liquidity  risk  or  speculative pressure in the debt market.\n\nIn 2021,  the  shortage  of  semiconductors  led  to general disruptions in the automotive market, which resulted in a decline in the group's business.\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  are also rated by several agencies. Any downgrading of their  ratings  could  limit  and/or  increase  the  cost  of access  to  the  capital  markets  for  these  group segments.  Under  current  market  conditions,  a possible  downgrading  of  Renault  SA's  credit  rating (Automotive segment) by Moody's would result in the downgrading  of  RCI  Banque  (Sales  Financing segment).\n\nThe table of Renault SA's credit ratings is presented below  (dated  December  31,  2021),  together  with  its bond,  bank  and  similar  debt  maturity  schedule  at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Renault SA ratings\n\n| Agency   | Rating & Outlook        | Date of last review   |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Moody's  | Ba2/NP/Negative outlook | 05 September 2021     |\n| S&P      | BB+/B/Negative outlook  | 05 March 2021         |\n| R&I      | A-/Negative outlook     | 11 March 2021         |\n| JCR      | A-/Stable outlook*      | 18 October 2021       |\n\n- * Change in outlook (from negative to stable).",

This  management  is  based  on  an internal  model  that  defines  the  level  of  the  liquidity reserve that the Automotive segment must maintain to  finance  its  activity  and  its  growth.  This  liquidity reserve  level  is  subject  to  close  monthly  monitoring through a periodic review and reporting to the Chief Financial  Officer.  Since  2020,  the  monitoring  and management of the liquidity reserve level have been enhanced to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and in 2021 with the shortage of electronic components.\n\nIn  2021,  Renault  SA  maintained  its  access  to  the capital  markets  by  issuing  two  'Eurobonds'  and  a 'Samurai'  bond.  The  two  Eurobonds  were  issued under  the  EMTN  program:  one  in  April  2021  with nominal value of \u20ac600 million with a 7-year maturity and the other in December 2021 with nominal value of \u20ac500  million  with  a  5.5-year  maturity.  The  Samurai\n\nFinancial\n\nstatements\n\nAnnual general\n\nmeetinh\n\nAdditional\n\ninformation\n\nRisk and control\n\nbond was issued at the beginning of July 2021 with a nominal  value  of  150  billion  yen.  It  consists  of  a tranche of 40 billion yen with a 2-year maturity and a tranche  of  110  billion  yen  with  a  3-year  maturity. Renault SA also maintained its access to short-term financing by using its NEU CP program.\n\nIn addition, in August 2021, Renault SA repaid \u20ac1 billion of the  \u20ac4  billion  drawn  in  2020  under  the  bank  credit agreement guaranteed by the French government. As a reminder, this credit agreement with an initial amount of  \u20ac5  billion  was  set  up  in  2020  to  finance  the  liquidity needs created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Usable until December 31, 2020, funds were drawn three times in the second half of 2020 for a total of \u20ac4 billion.\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  Renault  SA's funding, including bank loans and credit lines, does not contain any clause that might adversely affect credit availability as a result of a change in Renault Group's credit rating or its compliance with financial ratios.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  Automotive  segment (including  AVTOVAZ)  had  a  liquidity  reserve  of \u20ac17.3 billion, up \u20ac0.9 billion compared with the end of 2020. This liquidity reserve is well above the internal target, enabling the Automotive segment to meet its commitments in the coming 12 months. It consists of \u20ac13.9  billion  in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and \u20ac3.4  billion  in  committed  bank  credit  lines 1 , which remained unused at December 31, 2021.\n\nLiquidity  risk  management  for  the  Sales  Financing segment is  based  on  several  indicators  or  analyses, updated monthly on the basis of the latest estimates of outstanding loans and actual refinancing transactions. Laws relating to the outflow of deposits are subject to conservative assumptions. The group has limits governing its liquidity risk. RCI Banque must always have sufficient financial resources to ensure the long-term future of its business and development.  At  December  31,  2021,  RCI  Banque's liquidity reserve (European scope) stood at \u20ac14.4 billions. This controlled decrease of \u20ac2.2 billions compared with the end of 2020 means the carrying cost of cash surpluses can be reduced. Nevertheless, the liquidity reserve remains well above the internal targets. It comprises  \u20ac4.3  billions in undrawn committed  credit  lines,  \u20ac3.3  billions  in  collateral eligible for central bank monetary policy operations and \u20ac6.6 billions  in  high-quality  liquid  assets  (HQLA) and  0.2  billion  available  cash,  enabling  RCI  Banque Banque  to  maintain  the  financing  granted  to  its customers for more than 12 months without access to external sources of liquidity.\n\nFor  more  details  on  the  liquidity  risk  management system, see note 25-B1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\n04",

Credit  risk  arises  from  the uncertainty  that  the  customer  (debtor)  may  not  be able to meet the repayment obligations on the debt with RCI Banque.\n\nCredit  risk  can  thus  be  broken  down  into  default  risk (probability of a customer's failure to meet repayment obligations) and loss given default (non-repayment of debt at the time of default). The assessment of these two  components  of  credit  risk  is  linked  to  the socioeconomic  and  financial  elements  of  the  debtor and  to  the  macroeconomic  and  microeconomic context in which the debtor is found.\n\nAs  such,  the  level  of  credit  risk  is  expressed  on  the classification of loans according to their level of risk (classification  in  three  stages  according  to  IFRS  9) and on the level of impairment applied on each risk class  (stage).  Impairment  charges  on  loans  and losses are recognized annually and presented in the RCI  Banque  income  statement  in  the  'cost  of  risk' accounting aggregate. The level of the annual cost of risk thus expresses  the  marginal  increase  or decrease in credit risk on the customer loan portfolio.\n\nFor  the  2021  financial  year,  the  cost  of  risk  for  the Customer and Dealer Network business (financing for private  and  business  customers)  was  lower  than  in 2020.  This  positive  trend  is  the  result  of  favorable economic  factors  in  the  main  countries  where  RCI Banque operates (economic growth, lower unemployment, etc.) and internal factors at RCI Banque that  have  made  it  possible  to  improve  the  quality  of credit  from  the  outset  (tightening  of  acceptance policies) and boost recovery performance.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRCI  Banque's  acceptance  system  is  based  on statistical lending models, acceptance rules designed to protect our customers against the risk of over-indebtedness, the use of an external database designed  to  ensure  that  the  obligations  of  our  loan applicants are consolidated (except in France, where there  is  no  'positive'  file)  and  anti-fraud  measures. In addition, for dealer network financing, RCI Banque has  an  internal  rating  tool  that  enables  each counterparty to be graded on a risk scale.\n\nAll  the  acceptance  systems  are  governed  by  group standards  transposed  into  each  entity  of  the  RCI Banque group. The quality of credit risk at origination and throughout the life of the loan is monitored on an ongoing basis, and specific governance has been put in  place  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  the  credit  risk monitoring system.\n\nLastly, in a forward-looking management approach, RCI  Banque  makes  upward  adjustments  to  the amount of impairment on these outstanding\n\ncustomer loans using the forward-looking technique, which  takes  into  account  unfavorable  economic scenarios  and  'vulnerable'  sector-specific  factors and  measures  the  resilience  of  its  business  model and  the  level  of  equity  capital  by  applying  a  stress test to its customer loan portfolio.\n\nThe total cost of risk at December 31, 2021 was 0.14% of  average  performing  assets  and,  at  December  31, 2020, was 0.75%. At December 31, 2021, net customer assets  amounted  to  \u20ac38,213  million  and  net  dealer assets to \u20ac6,770 million.\n\nFor  further  details  on  customer  and  dealer  network credit  risk  management,  see  note  25-B6  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk related to tax changes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax laws or regulations, differences in interpretation with local tax authorities and changes in tax jurisprudence.\n\nThe  group  reserves  the  right  to  contest  any  tax adjustments that are deemed unfounded.\n\nFollowing  the  application  of  IFRIC  23  in  April  2019, uncertain tax treatments related to corporate income tax are now presented as tax liabilities in the corporate income tax line in other current operating liabilities.\n\nThe  main  tax  audits  and  disputes  in  progress  are described in chapter 5.2.2.6.3, note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and in section 4.3 'Litigation'.\n\nThe  tax  policy  is  presented  in  chapter  2,  section  4, paragraph 3.\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn all countries where it is established, Renault Group ensures  compliance  with  tax  rules  applicable  to  its activity, in accordance with international conventions and local laws.\n\nRenault  Group's  Tax  Department  is  responsible  for the  group's  tax  policy  worldwide,  including  the management of all tax-related risks.\n\nAs a support function attached to the Group Finance Department,  Renault  Group's  Tax  Department  is independent  of  the  operational  functions.  It  is supported by a local tax network in its mission.\n\nTax  risk  management  is  an  integral  part  of  the group's overall risk management process.\n\nThe Group Tax Department ensures the dissemination of tax compliance  standards  within  the  group (Automotive,  Sales  Financing  and  Mobility  Services) through internal communication channels.\n\nThe  Group  Tax  Department  takes  a  responsible approach to managing and controlling tax matters, based  on  the  relevant  documentation  and  rigorous internal control of tax processes.",

If the value of the vehicle is less than the residual value defined at the maturity of the financing contract, the holder of these residual values  incurs  a  loss  when  the  vehicle  is  sold. A  downward  trend  in  the  market  price  of  used vehicles can entail a risk for the holder of the residual values,  who  has  committed  to  taking  back  the vehicle at the end of the lease at a price fixed when the contracts are put in place. This risk could have a negative impact on the company's operating results and financial position due to the recognition of losses not foreseen at the origin of the contract.\n\nThe risk of a decrease in residual values is borne by the  group's  automotive  businesses  and  by  RCI Banque. RCI Banque is exposed to the residual value risk  on  financing  where  there  is  a  commitment  to take back the vehicle.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Renault Group's exposure to a change  in  residual  market  values  amounted  to \u20ac3,121  million  for  the  Automotive  segment  (net  book value  of  vehicles)  and  \u20ac2,110  million  for  RCI  Banque (value  of  the  buy-back  commitment  in  financing contracts). At December 31, 2020, it was \u20ac3,336 million and \u20ac1,810 million respectively.\n\n## Risk management\n\nDevelopments  in  the  used-vehicle  market  are periodically and thoroughly monitored by the Renault Group  Residual  Value  Committee,  which  analyses, among  other  things,  volumes  of  used  vehicle  sales, their  current  and  future  market  prices,  the  sales channel mix and the sale price of new units of these vehicles.  This  results  in  a  risk  estimation,  and provisions  are  carefully  made  for  the  loan  portfolio when the observed market values have fallen below the  level  of  the  Automotive  Division  or  RCI  Banque\n\nRisk and control\n\nbuy-back  commitments  or  if  specific  future  risks have been identified on the used car market.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExposure  to  interest  rate  risk  relates  mainly  to  the Sales Financing segment, for which this risk represents the impact of a change in interest rates on future financial gross margin. RCI Banque's operating income  may  be  affected  by  changes  in  market interest rates or rates paid on customer deposits.\n\n## Risk management\n\nInterest rate risk for the Sales Financing segment is managed on a daily basis: sensitivity is calculated by currency,  by  management  entity  and  by  asset portfolio, thus verifying that each entity respects its individual  imposed  limits.  Sensitivity  to  interest  rate risk is measured  using  the  same  methodology throughout  all  RCI  Banque  entities.  Sensitivity  is  a measure of the impact of an increase in interest rates on the value of balance sheet flows for each entity. The  magnitude  of  the  increase  depends  on  the currency. It is 100 bp for EUR, CHF, KRW, GBP and PLN, 200  bp  for  CZK  and  300  bp  for  BRL.  The  hedging system  enables  a  reduction  in  overall  exposure  for RCI Banque as well as for each entity. At December 31, 2021, after hedging, the absolute values for sensitivity  to  parallel  interest  rate  shock  in  each currency totaled \u20ac8.6 million, which is below the limit set by the group (\u20ac70 million).\n\nFor  the  Automotive  segment , liquidity  reserves  are generally  built  up  at  variable  rates,  and  long-term investments are generally financed at fixed rates, with the  exception  of  AVTOVAZ's  local  bank  financing, which  is  mainly  at  variable  rates.  The  Automotive segment's  available  cash  is  centralized,  as  far  as possible, within Renault SA, and invested in the form of short-term bank deposits by Renault Finance.\n\nFor further details on interest rate risk management, see note 25-B3 to the consolidated  financial statements.\n\nI\n\n04",

Each  event  is  reviewed  regularly,  in  particular  when the accounts are closed. After seeking the opinion of the  appropriate  advisers,  the  group  sets  aside  any provisions deemed necessary to cover the estimated risks  (see  note  20  'Provisions'  to  the  consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Proceedings on emissions\n\n## In France\n\nLike  several  other  manufacturers,  Renault  Group  has been  the  target  of  a  judicial  investigation  for aggravated  deception  since  2017.  This  case  follows the  investigation  conducted  by  the  DGCCRF  into  the emission  of  nitrogen  oxides  (NOx)  of  a  dozen  car manufacturers  selling  diesel  vehicles  in  France. Renault Group was charged with deception on 8 June 2021.  As  per  this  status,  the  company  is  presumed innocent.\n\nRenault Group denies having committed any offence and points out that its vehicles are not equipped with any  rigging  software  for  pollution  control  devices.\n\n## 4.3.2 Tax disputes\n\nTax risk is the risk associated with changes in tax laws or  regulations,  differences  in  interpretation  with  local tax authorities and changes in tax jurisprudence.\n\nEach of the known disputes or ongoing proceedings in which the group is involved was reviewed as of the balance sheet  date,  possibly  with  the  assistance  of external advisers, and provisions have been established  to  cover  the  estimated  risks  where appropriate.\n\nThe  company  takes  all  necessary  measures  to preserve its rights.\n\nAt this stage, Renault Group has had to post a bond of \u20ac20 million (\u20ac18 million of which will be dedicated to the  potential  payment  of  damages  and  fines)  and provide  a  \u20ac60  million  bank  guarantee  dedicated  to the potential compensation for losses.\n\n## International\n\nAlso on the matter of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, Renault Group has been the target of civil actions for damages in various countries for allegedly equipping its vehicles with rigging software for pollution control devices.\n\nIn  Germany,  for  example,  10  cases  are  under  way against  Renault  Group.  Ten  first-instance  decisions and three appeals court decisions have already been handed  down.  All  of  them  were  in  Renault  Group's favor.\n\nIn Austria, six civil proceedings are under way.\n\nIn  the  UK,  threatened  class  actions,  in  which  some very  preliminary  procedural  steps  have  been  taken, are currently being brought by four law firms against Renault Group and certain authorized dealers.\n\nLastly,  three  Dutch  foundations  have  initiated  legal proceedings  against  Renault  SA,  Renault  s.a.s., Renault  Nederland  NV,  Renault-Nissan  BV  and Automobile  Dacia  SA  in  the  Netherlands,  as  well  as certain authorized dealers.\n\nThere are currently significant disputes with the tax authorities in France, Spain and South Korea, mainly on transfer pricing issues.\n\nThe group disputes the arguments put forward by the tax authorities and has initiated dispute proceedings to assert its position.\n\nThe  group  considers  that  it  has  a  solid  case  for asserting its rights.",

At  constant  scope  and  exchange 3 rates,  it increased  by  8.0%  (negative  exchange  rate  effect mainly  related  to  the  devaluation  of  the  Russian Ruble,  the  Turkish  Lira,  the  Argentine  Peso  and  the Brazilian Real).\n\nAutomotive revenue excluding AVTOVAZ amounted to \u20ac40,404m, up 7.1% compared to 2020.\n\nThe recovery of the automotive market contributed 4.4 points.\n\nThe new  commercial  policy,  launched  in  the 3 rd quarter  of  2020  and  focusing  on  the  most profitable segments, led to a positive net price effect of 5.7 points. The success of Arkana, launched in the second quarter of 2021 and highlighting the return of Renault  brand  in  the  C  segment,  and  the  light commercial  vehicles  performance  generated  a positive product mix effect of 2.2 points.  These two effects allowed to compensate for the loss of volume of  7.5  points  mostly  linked  to  the  implementation  of this 'value over volumes' policy.\n\nThe  'Other'  effects,  of  +5.3  points,  came  from  the decline  in  sales  with  buy  back  commitments  in  line with  the  policy  of  selecting  the  most  profitable channels  and  following  the  disposal  of  several Renault Retail Group branches in 2021. The increase in aftersales  contribution  and  the  recovery  of network activity, strongly impacted by the lockdown measures in 2020, also contributed positively.\n\nAVTOVAZ's revenue increased by 10.4% to \u20ac2,850m, mainly due to strong price  increases  and  a  product mix  effect  of  +18.4  points,  more  than  offsetting  the negative impact of currencies ( -6.8 points). The LADA brand  maintained  its  leadership  in  Russia  with  a market  share  of  nearly  21%.  LADA  Vesta  and  LADA Granta  sales  ranked  respectively  at  the  1 st and 2 nd place in Russia.\n\nThe  Group  recorded  a  positive  operating  margin  of \u20ac1,663m  (3.6%  of  revenue)  compared  to  -\u20ac337m  in 2020.  It  reached  4.4%  of  revenue  in  the  second  half of 2021.\n\nAutomotive  operating  margin  excluding  AVTOVAZ improved by \u20ac1,710m to \u20ac260m (0.6% of revenue).\n\nThe  recovery  of  the  automotive  market  had  a positive impact of \u20ac293m.\n\nThe  mix/price/enrichment  effect  of  \u20ac1,127m  was  the result  of  the  commercial  policy  favoring  value  over volumes and price increases to cover exchange rate devaluations and cost inflation. This policy more than offset the negative volume effect of \u20ac579m.\n\nThe 'Productivity' effect (purchasing, warranty, R&D, manufacturing  &  logistics  costs,  G&A)  was  positive by  \u20ac852m,  mainly  due  to  purchasing  performance (\u20ac541m) and the optimization of R&D expenses.\n\nThese  operational  performances  largely  offset  the rise in raw material prices, which weighed for -\u20ac468m.\n\nThe 'Other' effects amounted to +\u20ac483m. The major contributors are stronger performance from parts and accessories, from our owned network and a favorable impact of sales with buy-back commitments.\n\nAVTOVAZ's  operating  margin amounted  to  \u20ac247m, up \u20ac106m, mainly reflecting the price increases that more  than  offset  the  negative  currency  effect  and the increase in raw material prices.\n\nThe contribution  of  Sales  Financing to  the  Group's operating  margin  reached  \u20ac1,185m,  an  increase  of \u20ac178m compared to 2020. This increase is mainly the result  of  a  sharp  improvement  in  the  cost  of  risk, which stood at  0.14%  of  average  performing  assets compared  to  0.75%  in  2020.  This  very  good  level  is explained  by  the  improvement  in  risk  parameters and a return to normal recovery processes impacted by the lockdowns in 2020.\n\nRCI Bank and Services posted new financing growth of 0.4%  (excluding  negative  currency  effects  of  -\u20ac92m) compared to 2020, helped by the strong performance of  used  vehicle  financings  and  by  average  financed amounts up 7.2% on new and used vehicles.\n\nOther operating income and expenses were negative at -\u20ac265m (compared to -\u20ac1,662m in 2020). Provisions for  restructuring  charges  of  -\u20ac430m  were  offset  by asset disposals (\u20ac487m) mainly related to the sale of several  Renault  Retail  Group  (RRG)  branches  in  line with the announced strategy.\n\nAfter  taking  into  account  other  operating  income and expenses, the Group's operating income stood at \u20ac1,398m compared to -\u20ac1,999m in 2020.\n\nThe financial result amounted  to  -\u20ac350m,  an improvement  of  \u20ac132m  compared  to  2020,  mainly related  to  the  accounting  revision  of  the  carrying value of the loan guaranteed by the French State.\n\nThe contribution of associated companies amounted to \u20ac515m,  including  \u20ac380m  related  to  Nissan's contribution,  an  increase  of  \u20ac5,660m  compared  to 2020.  As  a  reminder,  Nissan's  contribution  in  2020 included  -\u20ac4,290m  in  impairments  and  restructuring costs (including -\u20ac1,934m of IFRS restatements).\n\nI\n\n05",

Thanks to the 5 common electric platforms covering most segments, Renault brand aims to become 100% electric by 2030 for passenger cars in Europe.\n\nMore than one year ago, Renault Group launched the ReFactory  project  to  transform  the  Flins  plant (Yvelines,  France)  into  the  first  European  factory dedicated  to  the  circular  economy  of  mobility  and structured around 4 activity centers:\n\n- \u25cf RE-TROFIT  with  the  'Factory  VO'  (Used  Vehicles), the  first  factory  specialized  in  the retrofitting  and refurbishing activities of used cars on an industrial scale.\n- \u25cf RE-ENERGY  contributing  to  the  development  of applications  for  the  2 nd life  of  batteries  and  new energies.\n- \u25cf RE-CYCLE bringing together recycling and reuse of parts and materials.\n- \u25cf RE-START,  innovation  and  training  center  project, bringing  together  3  entities:  an  innovation  center dedicated  to  the  industry  4.0,  a  training  campus and  an  incubator  dedicated  to  research  and innovation in the circular economy.\n\nThe  Flins  ReFactory  aims  to  retrofit  45,000  vehicles per year by 2023 and repair 20,000 batteries per year by 2030, with 3,000 jobs on site in 2030.  This global industrial  project  is  intended  to  be  deployed  more widely, like the project launched at the Seville plant.\n\nFinally, Renault Group is rethinking its organization to support  the  transformation  of  the  automotive industry's  professions  and  launched  in  2021  the ReKnow  University  dedicated  to  the  acquisition  of new  skills in the electrification, analysis and cybersecurity of data or the recycling of vehicles and their batteries.

The  E-TECH  (EV  and  hybrid 1 powertrains)  range represents  30%  of  Renault  passenger  cars  sales  in Europe in 2021 (vs 17% in 2020).\n\n- \u25cf In Europe, Renault is 3 rd brand in the EV PC market, and ZOE ranks 2 nd model.\n- \u25cf Renault EV passenger car sales in Europe represent 14%, in an EV market at 10%.\n- \u25cf Renault is leader in France also in electrified market (EV+ Hybrid 1 ).\n- \u25cf Successful  E-TECH  hybrid  technology  supports strong commercial figures.\n\nRenault implements a selective sales policy favoring growth of higher value business:\n\n- \u25cf In the 2 nd half of 2021, the retail mix 2 rose by 10 points (vs 1 st half of 2021) to reach 50%.\n- \u25cf The  C-segment  re-conquest  started  successfully, with more than 60,000 orders of the Renault Arkana in  Europe  and  42,000  sales  registered  since  the launch in June 2021. The innovative E-TECH powertrain continues to exceed customer expectations, representing 56% of its sales mix.\n\nRenault reaffirms its strategy as a global brand:\n\n- \u25cf Markets  outside  of  Europe  now  represent  44%  of sales, (+1.3 pts vs 2020) with increased focus on profit.\n- \u25cf Renault recovers the leadership in the LCV European  market  (15.7%  w/o  pick-ups)  with  the successful launches of the all-new Express Van and Kangoo Van .\n- \u25cf The  All-New  Kangoo  Van  was  rewarded  ''2022 International Van of The Year''.\n\nRenault has built a solid and performing base in 2021 and  will  benefit  from  it  to  accelerate  its  growth  on electrification and  C -segment,  with  two  major launches:  All-New M\u00e9gane  E -TECH  Electric and All-New Austral , to be introduced in 2022.\n\n## Dacia and Lada brands\n\nDacia grew by 3% in 2021, with sales reaching 537,095, in a  market  tainted  by  the  pandemic  and  the electronic component crisis.\n\nThe brand  experienced  strong  growth  in  the passenger car market for private customers where it reached  a  record-breaking  market  share  of  6.2%, resulting  in  Dacia  placing  in  the  top  three  of European retail sales for the first time ever.\n\nThis result is driven by the successful new generations  of  Dacia  Sandero  (over  226,000  units sold  across  the  Sandero  range)  and  Dacia  Duster (more than 186,000 units).\n\nSandero  has  remained  Europe's  best-selling  retail model every  year  since  2017,  while Duster has  been Europe's best-selling retail SUV since 2018.\n\nWith sales starting in March, Dacia Spring (27,876  units  sold)  is  already  a  front-runner  in  the EV market. Orders have reached over 46,000 units in just nine months after reveal.\n\nDacia's  attractiveness  is  recognised  with  conquest and  loyalty  rates  that  remain  very  high  in  2021. This  trend  is  set  to  continue  in  2022  with  the expansion  of  the  product  line-up  and  first-quarter commercial  launch  of  All-New  Jogger,  a  seven-seat family vehicle.\n\nIn 2021, 350,714 Lada cars were sold in Russia, which is 2.1%  more  than  at  the  end  of  2020.

Sales financing\n\nIn a context still disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, RCI Bank and Services new financings increased by 0.4% (excluding forex effect, negative at -\u20ac92 million) compared to 2020, helped by the strong performance  of  used  vehicles  financing  contracts and the progression of the average financed amount on new and used vehicles.\n\nRCI Bank and Services financed 1,415,841 contracts in 2021,  decreasing  by  6.9%  compared  to  2020.  Used Car Financing posted an increase of 4.1% compared to 2020, with 363,711 financed contracts.\n\nExcluding Turkey , Russia (RN Bank) and India (Equity Affiliated  Companies),  the  finance  penetration  rate amounts  to  46.0%  versus  47.5%  in  2020,  in  relation with  a  registration  mix  more  oriented  on  the  Fleet segment (+3 pts compared to 2020) and to a refocus on the most profitable channels.\n\nNew financings (excluding credit cards and personal loans) amount to \u20ac17.8 billion only decreasing by 0.2% thanks  to  the  progression  of  the  average  financed amount by 7.2%. Excluding the negative forex effect of -\u20ac92 million, new financings improve by 0.4%.\n\nThe average performing assets (APA) related to the Retail Activity totalizes \u20ac37.6 billion in 2021. Excluding -\u20ac59,1  million  of  negative  forex  impact,  it  slightly increases  by  0.2%  compare  to  2020  thanks  to the  good  trend  of  the  new  financings  over  the  year 2021.  The  average  performing  assets  linked  to  the Wholesale Activity represents \u20ac7.1 billion, decreasing by  -23.4%,  as  a  consequence  of  the  impacts  of  the semi-conductor  shortage  on  the  manufacturing  of new cars and to the inventory optimization strategy in  the  dealer  network  for  the  Renault  Group  brands. Overall,  the  average  performing  assets  totalize \u20ac44.8 billion, down -4.6% compared to 2020.\n\n## RCI Bank and Services, financing performance\n\n|                                               | 2021   | 2020   | Change  (%)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| Number of financing contracts                 |        |        |               |\n| (Thousands)                                   | 1,416  | 1,520  | -6.9          |\n| Including Used Vehicles contracts (Thousands) | 364    | 349    | +4.1          |\n| New financing  (\u20ac billion)                    | 17.8   | 17.8   | -0.2          |\n| Average performing assets  (\u20ac billion)        | 44.8   | 46.9   | -4.6          |\n\n## Penetration rate by brand\n\n|                                              |   2021 (%) | 2020 (%)   |   Change (points) |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|\n| Renault                                      |       41.7 | 45.7       |              -4   |\n| Dacia                                        |       46.5 | 47.4       |              -1   |\n| Renault Samsung Motors                       |       59.2 | 66.2       |              -7.1 |\n| Lada                                         |        4.9 | -          |               4.9 |\n| Nisan                                        |       35.8 | 37.9       |              -2.1 |\n| Inifiniti                                    |        3.1 | 25.9       |             -22.8 |\n| Datsun                                       |       24.3 | 26.6       |              -2.3 |\n| RCI Bank and Services                        |       37.5 | 45.3       |              -7.8 |\n| RCI Bank and Services (excluding  EAC  (1) ) |       46   | 47.5       |              -1.5 |\n\n(1) EAC = entities consolidated under equity method: Russia, Turkey and India.\n\nI",

At  constant  scope  and  exchange 1 rates,  it increased  by  8.0%  (negative  exchange  rate  effect mainly  related  to  the  devaluation  of  the  Russian Ruble,  the  Turkish  Lira,  the  Argentine  Peso  and  the Brazilian Real).\n\nAutomotive revenue excluding AVTOVAZ amounted to \u20ac40,404m, up 7.1% compared to 2020.\n\nThe recovery of the automotive market contributed 4.4 points.\n\nThe new  commercial  policy,  launched  in  the 3 rd quarter  of  2020  and  focusing  on  the  most profitable segments, led to a positive net price effect of 5.7 points. The success of Arkana, launched in the second quarter of 2021 and highlighting the return of Renault  brand  in  the  C  segment,  and  the  light commercial  vehicles  performance  generated  a positive product mix effect of 2.2 points.  These two\n\neffects allowed to compensate for the loss of volume of  7.5  points  mostly  linked  to  the  implementation  of this 'value over volumes' policy.\n\nThe  'Other'  effects,  of  +5.3  points,  came  from  the decline  in  sales  with  buy  back  commitments  in  line with  the  policy  of  selecting  the  most  profitable channels  and  following  the  disposal  of  several Renault Retail Group branches in 2021. The increase in aftersales  contribution  and  the  recovery  of network activity, strongly impacted by the lockdown measures in 2020, also contributed positively.\n\nAVTOVAZ's revenue increased by 10.4% to \u20ac2,850m, mainly due to strong price  increases  and  a  product mix  effect  of  +18.4  points,  more  than  offsetting  the negative impact of currencies (-6.8 points). The LADA brand  maintained  its  leadership  in  Russia  with  a market  share  of  nearly  21%.  LADA  Vesta  and  LADA Granta  sales  ranked  respectively  at  the  1 st and 2 nd place in Russia.\n\n## Operating segment contribution to group operating profit\n\n| (\u20ac million)                       | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Automotive division excl.

It  reached  4.4%  of  revenue  in  the  second  half of 2021.\n\nAutomotive  operating  margin  excluding  AVTOVAZ improved by \u20ac1,710m to \u20ac260m (0.6% of revenue).\n\nThe  recovery  of  the  automotive  market  had  a positive impact of \u20ac293m.\n\nThe  mix/price/enrichment  effect  of  \u20ac1,127m  was  the result  of  the  commercial  policy  favoring  value  over volumes and price increases to cover exchange rate devaluations and cost inflation. This policy more than offset the negative volume effect of \u20ac579m.\n\nThe 'Productivity' effect (purchasing, warranty, R&D, manufacturing  &  logistics  costs,  G&A)  was  positive by  \u20ac852m,  mainly  due  to  purchasing  performance (\u20ac541m) and the optimization of R&D expenses.\n\nThese  operational  performances  largely  offset  the rise  in  raw  material  prices,  which  weighed  for  \u20ac468m.\n\nThe  'Other'  effects  amounted  to  +\u20ac483m.  The  major contributors are stronger performance from parts and accessories, from our owned network and a favorable impact of sales with buy-back commitments.\n\nAVTOVAZ's  operating  margin amounted  to  \u20ac247m, up \u20ac106m, mainly reflecting the price increases that more  than  offset  the  negative  currency  effect  and the increase in raw material prices.\n\nThe contribution  of  Sales  Financing to  the  Group's operating  margin  reached  \u20ac1,185m,  an  increase  of \u20ac178m compared to 2020. This increase is mainly the result  of  a  sharp  improvement  in  the  cost  of  risk, which stood at  0.14%  of  average  performing  assets compared  to  0.75%  in  2020.  This  very  good  level  is explained  by  the  improvement  in  risk  parameters and a return to normal recovery processes impacted by the lockdowns in 2020.\n\nRCI Bank and Services posted new financing growth of 0.4%  (excluding  negative  currency  effects  of  -\u20ac92m) compared to 2020, helped by the strong performance of  used  vehicle  financings  and  by  average  financed amounts up 7.2% on new and used vehicles.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st , 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their  operations  and  their  financing,  and  have  led  to  greater  uncertainties  on  their  future  prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nI\n\n05",

The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nFor  2021  year-end  closing,  these  impairment  tests  consider,  the  decline  in  sales  volumes  mainly  due  to  Covid-19 pandemic,  the  negative  effects  linked  with  the  component  crisis  and  the  assumptions  used  in  the  update  of the Renaulution medium-term plan.\n\nIn addition, the perpetuity growth rates used in the tests as of December 31, 2021 take into account the impacts of the commitments made by the signatory States of the Paris agreements on climate change.\n\nWe have considered that the valuation of assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements  and  because  of  the  estimates  and  judgments  required  from  Management  to  prepare  these  tests, particularly in the current context described above.",

In  accordance  with  the  approach  described  in  the  accounting  rules  and methodes (note 2-M), an impairment test of the investment in Nissan was carried out at December 31, 2021. |\n| Our audit response | Our audit response to the risks identified mainly consisted in:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    | \u25cf Understanding the conclusions and the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan in accordance with  our  instructions  which  detail  the  procedures  to  be  performed  and  the  conclusion  format  required  for  our audit purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                    | matter given its magnitude to Renault's consolidated financial statements, and given the following areas of attention: (1)  the  judgment  of  management  to  assess  the  Alliance  governance  structure  as  well  as  facts  and  circumstances underlying  Renault's  significant  influence  over  Nissan,  (2)  the  completeness  of  adjustments  to  Nissan's  financial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                    | \u25cf Examining the relevance of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable  value  of  its  investment  in  Nissan,  by  reference  to  Nissan  mid-term  plan,  historical  performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives of the Automotive sector. \u25cf Assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\nI\n\n05",

As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nThe sales financing activity is managed by RCI Banque with dedicated offers for individuals and companies as well as the financing of dealer networks.\n\nRCI  Banque  sets  aside  provisions  to  cover  the  risk  of  losses  resulting  from  the  inability  of  its  clients  to  meet  their financial commitments. RCI Banque applies the accounting principles of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' which defines a provisioning model for expected losses based on three stages of risk: healthy receivables (stage 1), receivables showing higher credit risk since initial recognition (stage 2), and receivables in default (stage 3).\n\nThe  provisions  related  to  IFRS  9  are  detailed  in  Note  15  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  amounts  to 1,028 M\u20ac for an outstanding amount of 40526 M\u20ac.\n\nWe consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key point of the audit, due to the significant amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group's balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses. As mentioned in the note 2-B, those assumptions are even more important in the current situation of the Covid-19 crisis which brings major economical uncertainties in the world for the years to come.",

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable assurance  about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not  include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the  quality  of  management  of  the  affairs  of  the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due  to  fraud  or  error,  designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25cf Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25cf Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u25cf Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the\n\nI",

Information on operating segments and Regions\n\nThe operating segments defined by Renault Group are the following:\n\n- \u25cf The 'Automotive' segments,  which  in  practice consist of two segments:\n- \u25cf The 'Automotive excluding AVTOVAZ' segment, consisting of the Group's automotive activities as they  existed  before  Renault  acquired  control  of the AVTOVAZ group under IFRS 10. This segment comprises the production, sales, and distribution subsidiaries for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, automotive service subsidiaries for the Renault, Dacia, Samsung and Alpine  brands,  and  the  subsidiaries  in  charge  of the segment's cash management. It also includes investments  in  automotive-sector  associates and joint ventures, principally Nissan.\n- \u25cf The  'AVTOVAZ'  segment,  consisting  of  the Russian  automotive  group  AVTOVAZ  and  its parent company  Lada  Auto  Holding  OOO (previously Alliance Rostec Auto b.v., see Note 3). This segment was formed at the end of 2016, after Renault  acquired  control,  as  defined  by  IFRS  10, over these entities in December 2016.\n- \u25cf The 'Sales  Financing' segment,  which  the  Group considers  as  an  operating  activity  in  its  own  right, carried  out  for  the  distribution  network  and  final customers  by  RCI  Banque,  its  subsidiaries  and  its investments in associates and joint ventures.\n- \u25cf The 'Mobility  Services' segment  consisting  of services for new mobilities brought together in the holding  company  Renault  M.A.I.  (Mobility  As  an Industry).\n\nThe segment result regularly reviewed by the Board of Management  (which  replaces  the  Group  Executive Committee  from  2021), identified as the 'Chief Operating  Decision-Maker',  is  the operating  margin . The  definition  of  this  indicator  is  unchanged  from previous years and is detailed in Note 2-D Presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe operating margin excludes restructuring costs.\n\nThe new brand-based organization announced by Luca de  Meo,  effective  from  2021,  did  not  affect  the operating  segments  defined  above.  The  presentation of business  results  by  segment  to  the  Board  of Management continues to use the same segments as at December 31, 2020.\n\nI\n\n05",

Changes in accounting policies in 2021\n\nRenault  Group  applies  the  accounting  standards  and  amendments  that  have  been  published  in  the  Official Journal of the European Union and are mandatory from January 1, 2021.\n\n## New amendments that became mandatory on January 1, 2021\n\n| Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16   | Interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amendments to IFRS 4                                          | Extension of the provisional exemption to applying IFRS 9  until financial years beginning before January 1, 2023 |\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS  16  concerning  Phase  2  of  the  interest  rate benchmark  reform  and  financial  instruments  were applied early by the Group in its financial statements at  December  31,  2020.  In  2020,  the  Automotive segments  (through  the  intermediary  of  Renault Finance)  adhered  to  the  ISDA  2018  Benchmarks Supplement  Protocol.  The  Sales  Financing  segment adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol in 2020,  and  the  ISDA  2018  Benchmarks  Supplement Protocol in 2021.\n\nDuring  the  second  half  of  2021,  the  Sales  Financing segment terminated interest rate swaps included in hedging  relationships  and  involving  benchmarks concerned by the reform.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group has no interest rate hedging  relationship,  as  defined  by  IFRS  9,  that involves  an  interest  rate  benchmark  concerned  by the  reform,  and  it  considers  there  is  no  uncertainty regarding  the  future  of  the  EURIBOR  rate  since  its\n\nvalidation  by  the  European  Banking  Authority  as benchmark regulation-compliant.\n\nApplication of the other amendments from January 1, 2021 has no material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## New amendment effective from April 1, 2021\n\nIn  March  2021  the  IASB  published  an  amendment to IFRS  16  entitled  'Covid-19-Related  rent  concessions beyond June 30, 2021', with an effective date of April 1, 2021,  extending  the  application  period  for  the  2020 amendment 'Covid-19-Related rent concessions'. In line  with  the  position  taken  for  2020,  the  Group  has not applied this amendment  in  the  financial statements  at  December  31,  2021.  As  in  2020,  the concessions from which the Group benefited in 2021 have no significant impact.\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

IFRS IC Agenda Decision on attributing benefit to periods of service (IAS 19)\n\nIn May 2021 the IFRS IC published an Agenda Decision to  clarify  the  periods  of  service  to  which  an  entity should allocate a retirement indemnity under a plan in which:\n\n- \u25cf the  indemnity  is  payable  to  all  employees  still employed by the company when they retire;\n- \u25cf the  amount  of  the  indemnity  depends  on  the number of years the employee has worked for the company, capped at a certain number of months' salary).\n\nThe  decision  clarifies  that  for  such  a  plan,  in application  of  IAS  19,  the  cost  of  the  retirement indemnity  must  be  attributed  to  the  final  years  of service that earn the entitlement to the benefit (not spread over the employee's entire career).\n\nThe provision for vested benefits has been modified in  the  2021  financial  statements  in  accordance  with this interpretation.  The  amount  involved  is  not material.\n\n## 2-A3.

IFRS IC interpretation concerning recognition of Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)  (IFRS 9 and IAS 20)\n\nThe IFRS IC decision clarifying analysis and recognition of TLTRO III transactions, which was due to  be  finalized  in  December 2021, has been deferred to February 2022. This decision applies to drawings of\n\nTLTRO III financing by the Sales Financing segment, to  which  the  Group  has  opted  to  apply  IFRS  9. More  details  of  these  transactions  are  provided  in Note 23-C.\n\n## 2-B. Estimates and judgments\n\n## Specific context of 2020 and 2021\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic that appeared in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and continued throughout the year 2020, the global automotive market suffered a  year-on-year  downturn  of  14.4%  between  2019  and 2020. To protect its employees, and in compliance with the  measures  introduced  by  national  governments, the Group suspended its commercial and production activities in most countries during March 2020. During the  lockdown  periods,  practically  all  employees  not working  in  production  and  sales  worked  from  home, and  furlough  measures  were  put  in  place  in  2020. Production and sales resumed mainly from May 2020, respecting  the  end-of-lockdown  measures  imposed by the governments of the countries where the Group has operations. A second lockdown and curfews were imposed in several countries, including France, during the second half of 2020; all these measures also had negative  effects  on  the  Group's  business  activity  in 2020.  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic,  which  were  less  serious  but  continued  in 2021,  business  also  began  to  be  affected  during  the first  half-year  of  2021  by  disruption  to  supplies  of electronic  components  in  the  worldwide  automotive sector.  This  disruption  grew  during  the  second  halfyear,  with  the  principal  consequence  of  losses  of production output. As a result, after a fall of more than 20%  between  2019  and  2020,  sales  volumes  for  2021 were 4.5% lower than in 2020, at 2,696,401 units.\n\nTo  maintain  a  sufficient  level  of  liquidity  for  its operations,  in  2020  the  Group  arranged  a  \u20ac5  billion credit  line  guaranteed  by  the  French  government,  on which  it  made  three  drawings  totalling  \u20ac4  billion.  The \u20ac1  billion  undrawn  at  December  31,  2021  ceased  to  be available at that date, and \u20ac1 billion of the August 2020 \u20ac2 billion drawing was repaid in August 2021 (Note 23-C). The  Group  also  issued  a  new  bond  in  November  2020 with nominal value of \u20ac1 billion (Note 23-C), and several bonds  in  2021  (a  \u20ac600  million  bond  in  April  2021,  a \u20ac1.2 billion Samurai bond in July 2021 and a \u20ac500 million bond  in  December  2021).  The  Group  also  generated  a significant  positive  free  cash  flow  in  2021  (Note  6.1.A4). At  the  date  of  publication  of  these  consolidated financial statements, the Group has sufficient cash and sources of financing to ensure continuity of operations for  the  next  twelve  months  and  has  demonstrated  its capacity to issue debt (Note 23-C).\n\nExpenses and income recognized that are identified as  resulting  wholly  or  partly  from  the  Covid-19 pandemic  or  the  components  supply  crisis  are  not\n\nconsidered as 'Other operating income and expenses',  except  for  expenses  which  due  to  their nature are always included in that category, such as impairment of tangible and intangible assets.\n\nPayroll  costs  net  of  state  aid  received,  additional logistics  costs,  the  costs  of  introducing  new  health protocols, and depreciation on assets unused or only partially-used during the period, mainly as a result of national  lockdown  rules  or  production  halts  due  to disrupted electronic component supplies, are allocated  to  the  relevant  functions  (cost  of  goods and  services sold, research and  development expenses,  and  selling,  general  and  administrative expenses). The amounts concerned are not reported because  it  is  impossible  to  reliably  identify  the amounts attributable solely to the Covid-19 pandemic or the components supply crisis.\n\nThe 2020 consolidated financial statements included restatements of some assets and liabilities undertaken in the context of this pandemic, and the update  of  the  'Renaulution'  medium-term  business plan (2021-2025). The principal impacts were \u20ac762  million  of  impairment  in  respect  of  certain tangible and intangible assets (Note 6), \u20ac248 million resulting  from  discontinuation  of  recognition  of deferred  tax  assets  (Note  8),  and  a  \u20ac216  million increase in impairment for expected credit losses on Sales  Financing  receivables  (Note  15).  Estimation  of the  impacts  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  on  the  2020 financial  statements,  described  in  this  paragraph, was  particularly  complex  and  involved  the  use  of judgments  explained  in  the  Notes  where  relevant. No  comparable  significant  accounting  adjustments were made in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic or disruption to supplies of electronic components.\n\nIn  France,  on  November 20, 2020 the Group signed an agreement with its social partners on the transformation  of  technical  and  service  skills  in preparation for future developments in the automotive world. This agreement defined the conditions for a new outplacement  policy,  and  included  a  voluntary  workexemption  plan  for  relevant  personnel  in  2021,  and  a Collective Contractual Separation plan for a maximum 1,900  employee departures. In the foreign subsidiaries, the  Group  has  rolled  out  restructuring  actions  in  line with the 3-year fixed cost reduction plan announced in May  2020.  Restructuring  and  workforce  adjustment provisions  were  recognized  in  2020  for  these  plans, most of which were completed at December 31, 2021.\n\nI\n\n05",

Through this key agreement Renault Group is making France the strategic and industrial centre of its promising future businesses,  to  strengthen  the  Group  in  its  home country, contribute to its transformation and carry all its French  businesses  towards  the  automotive industry's new value chain (Notes 6-A and 20).\n\nRBJAC  is  in  financial  distress,  and  its  ability  to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months has  been  considered  uncertain  since  June  30,  2021. On January 12, 2022 RBJAC was placed in receivership (Note 13).\n\nIn the  context  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  new workforce  reduction  plans,  the  announcement  in early  2021  of  the  new  medium-term  business  plan 'Renaulution' (2021-2025), and the electronic components  supply  crisis,  the  main  items  in  the Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  that  are dependent on estimates  and  judgements  and  have been paid particular attention in 2020 and 2021 are:\n\n- \u25cf potential  impairment  of  fixed  assets,  particularly impairment  on  specific  assets  linked  to  vehicles and goodwill (Note 11);\n- \u25cf the recoverable value of leased vehicles classified as property, plant and equipment or inventories;\n- \u25cf investments  in  associates,  notably  Nissan  and RBJAC (Notes 12 and 13);\n- \u25cf impairment  for  expected  credit  losses  concerning Sales Financing receivables (Note 15);\n- \u25cf revenue recognition;\n- \u25cf determination of restructuring provisions (Notes 6-A and 20);\n- \u25cf determination  of  risks  associated  with  distressed suppliers;\n- \u25cf the potential impact  of  the  European  CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) regulation from 2020: under this regulation, automakers will be fined if  the  average CO2 emissions target for all vehicles registered in Europe each calendar year is exceeded (Note 28);\n- \u25cf determination of compliance with the requirements of IFRS 5 for reclassification of assets or groups of assets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  and  reporting them  on  specific  lines  in  the  balance  sheet  in  the current assets and current liabilities (Note 3-E).\n\nThis list is not exhaustive due to the constantly evolving Covid-19 situation and its effects on the financial health of the world's economies, and it remains very difficult to predict the magnitude and duration of the pandemic's economic impacts on our business. The same applies to the  worldwide  crisis  electronic  components  supplies for the automotive industry.\n\n## Other important estimates and judgments\n\nRenault  Group  often  has  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the book value of certain assets and  liabilities,  income  and  expenses,  and  disclosures made  in  certain  notes  to  the  financial  statements. In  preparing  its  financial  statements,  Renault  Group regularly revises its estimates and assessments to take account  of  past  experience  and  other  factors  deemed relevant in view of the economic circumstances. It takes into consideration forthcoming regulations (notably new European  Union  regulations  on  air  pollution  and  CO2 emissions),  the  foreseeable  effects  of  commitments made  in  response  to  environmental  issues,  forecast technological  and  market  developments  (commodity costs,  changing  customer  demand,  etc)  and  any  other developments  that  could  have  a  significant  impact  on the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  application  of IFRS rules. If changes  in these assumptions or circumstances  are  not  as  anticipated,  the  figures reported in Renault Group's future consolidated financial statements could differ from the estimates established at  the  time  these  financial  statements  were  finalized. The  main  items  in  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements at December 31, 2021 that are dependent on estimates and judgments are the following:\n\n- \u25cf capitalization of research and development expenses and their amortization period (Note 10-A),\n- \u25cf the depreciation and amortization periods for fixed assets other than capitalized development expenses (Note 10),\n- \u25cf recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  on  tax  loss carryforwards (Note 8),\n- \u25cf provisions, particularly warranty  provisions  on vehicles and batteries sold (Note 20), provisions for pensions  and  other  long-term  employee  benefit obligations  (Note  19),  provisions  for  workforce adjustment  measures  (Note  6-A),  provisions  for legal risks and tax risks (other than income tax risks and provisions for uncertain tax liabilities),\n- \u25cf valuation of lease liabilities, particularly the incremental borrowing rates and the value of renewal and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised (Note 23).",

        "page_content": "## 2-C. Consolidation principles\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the financial  statements  of  all  companies  controlled exclusively  by  the  Group  either  directly  or  indirectly (subsidiaries). Jointly controlled companies  are accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  when  they are classified as joint ventures and consolidated on the  basis  of  the  percentage  share  specific  to  each balance sheet and income statement item when they are classified as joint operations.\n\nCompanies in which the Group exercises significant influence  (associates)  are  included  in  the  financial statements on an equity basis.\n\nSignificant intercompany transactions and unrealized internal profits are eliminated.\n\nInvestments  in  non-significant  companies  that  are controlled exclusively by the Group but not consolidated,  even  though  they  fulfil  the  above criteria, are recorded as other non-current assets.\n\nConsolidation  of  all  these  companies  would  have  a negligible  impact  on  the  consolidated  financial\n\nFinancial statements\n\nstatements, since their losses, if any, are recognized via impairment. Also, they are financed by the Group and acquire almost all  their  purchases,  or  carry  out almost all their sales, with Group companies.\n\nPut options on non-controlling interests are carried in the consolidated financial position at fair value, and classified in other financial liabilities in the Automotive  segments  and  in  other  non-current liabilities  in  the  Sales  Financing  segment,  with  a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nOutstanding price supplements payable to shareholders  who  have  sold  shares  to  the  Group  are recorded in the financial position, in financial liabilities (Automotive  and  Mobilities  segments)  or  in  other liabilities  (Sales  Financing  segment)  to  give  a  better estimation  of  the  obligation.  The  liability  is  initially recognized via an adjustment to goodwill (or unconsolidated  investments)  and  subsequently  via profit and loss (other financial income and expenses, or the  share  in  net  income  of  associates  and  joint ventures, depending on the nature of the investment).\n\n## 2-D. Presentation of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Valuation basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are established  under  the  historical  cost  convention, except for certain categories of assets and liabilities, in compliance  with  IFRS  rules.  The  categories concerned are detailed in the following notes.\n\n## Operating income and operating margin\n\nOperating  income  includes  all  revenues  and  costs directly  related  to  the  Group's  activities,  whether recurrent or resulting from non-recurring decisions or operations, such as restructuring costs.\n\nThe  operating  margin,  which  corresponds  to  the operating  income  of  an  individual  segment  as defined in IFRS 8, Operating Segments, corresponds to  the  operating  income  before  other  operating income and expenses, which are by nature unusual or significant  and  could  affect  comparability  of  the margin.\n\nOther operating income and expenses cover:\n\n- \u25cf restructuring and workforce adjustment costs, and significant costs relating to discontinued activities. Restructuring  costs  are  defined  as  follows  in  the definition  given  in  IAS  37  -  Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: 'A restructuring is a  programme  that  is  planned  and  controlled  by management, and materially changes either: a) the scope of a business undertaken by the entity; or b) the manner in which that business is conducted';\n- \u25cf gains  or  losses  on  partial  or  total  disposal  of businesses or operating entities, gains or losses on total or partial disposals of investments in associates  and  joint  ventures,  other  gains  and losses relating to changes  in  the  scope  of consolidation  such  as  acquisitions  of  control,  as defined by IFRS 10, over entities previously accounted for under the equity method, and direct acquisition costs for entities that are fully consolidated  or  consolidated  on  a  line-by-line percentage of interest basis;\n- \u25cf gains  or  losses  on  disposal  of  property,  plant  and equipment  or  intangible  assets  (except  leased assets sales);\n- \u25cf impairment  on  property,  plant  and  equipment  or intangible assets and goodwill (excluding goodwill of associates or joint ventures);\n- \u25cf unusual  items,  i.e.  income  and  charges  that  are unusual  in  their  frequency,  nature  or  amount, relating  to  significant  litigation  or  impairment  of operating receivables.\n\nWith the exception of the tax charge, the share in net income  of  associates  and  joint  ventures,  and financial  interest  on  pension  and  other  long-term employee  benefit obligations, all income and expenses resulting from the Sales Financing activity are included in operating income and expenses.\n\nI\n\n05",

The  impairment  booked  is limited to the net book value of the investment, unless an additional commitment has been made.\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  resulting  from  the  sale  or  loss  of significant influence or joint control over associates and  joint  ventures  accounted  for  under  the  equity method, and the gain or loss on acquisition of control, as  defined  by  IFRS  10,  over  companies  that  were already  consolidated  but  not  controlled,  is  reported in  other  operating  income  and  expenses  in  the Group's consolidated income statement. This includes transfers of accumulated translation adjustments  during  the  period  the  entity  was accounted for under the equity method.\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  deferred  tax  liability  on dividend  distributions  for  all  differences  between the  book  and  tax  values  of  its  investments  in associates  and  joint  ventures  (Note  2-I).  This  tax  is included  in  current  and  deferred  taxes  in  the Group's income statement.\n\nGoodwill  relating  to  associates  and  joint  ventures  is included in the value of the relevant entities as stated in the  assets  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial position. In the event of impairment, an impairment loss is  booked  and  included  in  the  consolidated  income statement  via  the  share  in  net  income  (loss)  of associates and joint ventures (Note 2-J).\n\nAcquisition  expenses  related  to  investments  in associates  and  joint  ventures  are  included  in  the initial acquisition cost for these investments.\n\nCross-investments  between  a  consolidated  entity  and an associate are neutralized in measuring the investment in the associate as stated in the assets of the statement  of  financial  position.  Nissan's  15%  stake  in Renault is therefore neutralized in valuing the investment in  Nissan  shown  in  the  assets  of  the  consolidated statement of financial position (Note 12).\n\nDividends  received  from  unlisted  associates  and joint ventures  are  included  in  the  Automotive operational free cash flow, while dividends received from listed associates and joint ventures, i.e. Nissan,\n\nare  excluded  from  Automotive  operational  free cash flow.\n\n## Reporting by operating segment\n\nThe  information  by  operating  segment  is  based  on internal reporting to the Board  of Management, identified  as  the  'Chief  Operating  Decision-Maker'. This information is prepared under the IFRSs applicable to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  All  Group financial data are assigned to the operating segments. The 'Intersegment transactions' and 'IntraAutomotive'  columns  are  reserved  for  transactions between the  segments,  which  are  carried  out  on  nearmarket terms. Dividend payments  by  the  Sales Financing  segment  are  included  in  that  segment's  net financial income and expenses.\n\nThe indicator used to evaluate segment performance is the operating margin.\n\nThe  effects  of  the  French  consolidated  taxation system  are  included  in  the  tax  expense  of  the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  are  specific  to  each  segment. Receivables  assigned  by  the  Automotive  segments to  the  Sales  Financing  companies  are  treated  as operating assets by the assignee when the risks and benefits are substantially transferred. These receivables are mostly receivables on the dealership network.\n\nVehicles  and  batteries  for  which  the  Automotive segment has a repurchase commitment are included in  the  segment's  assets.  When  these  assets  are financed by the Sales Financing segment, the Sales Financing  segment  recognizes  a  receivable  on  the Automotive segment.\n\n## Current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nSales Financing receivables, other securities, derivatives, loans and financial liabilities of the Sales Financing segment (other than participating shares and  subordinated  loans)  are  considered  as  current assets  and  liabilities,  because  they  are  used  in  this operating segment's normal business cycle.\n\nFor  the  Automotive  segments,  in  addition  to  items directly related to the business cycle, all assets and liabilities  maturing  within  one  year  are  classified as current.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\n## 2-E. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies\n\nThe Group's presentation currency is the euro.\n\nFor  foreign  companies,  the  functional  currency  is generally  the  local  currency.  In  cases  where  most transactions  are  carried  out  in  a  different  currency, that is adopted as the functional currency.\n\nForeign companies' accounts are established in their functional  currency,  and  subsequently  translated into the Group's presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u25cf financial position items other than components of shareholders' equity, which are stated at historical value, are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- \u25cf income  statement  items  are  translated  at  the average exchange rate for the period;\n- \u25cf the  translation  adjustment  is  one  of  the  other components of comprehensive income, and therefore has no impact on net income.\n\nGoodwill generated by a business combination with a foreign company is treated as an asset or liability of the  entity  acquired,  as  appropriate.  It  is  therefore expressed in the relevant entity's functional currency,  and  translated  into  euros  at  the  closing rate.\n\nWhen  a  foreign  company  is  sold,  the  accumulated translation  adjustments  on  its  assets  and  liabilities are  transferred  to  other  operating  income  and expenses in the income statement.\n\nIn an  exception  to  the  above  principles,  the financial statements of entities in hyperinflationary\n\neconomies  are  translated  in  accordance  with IAS  29  'Financial  reporting  in  hyperinflationary economies'.  Non-monetary  balance  sheet  items, income  statement  items,  comprehensive  income items  and  cash  flow  statement  items  are  adjusted for  inflation  in  their  original  local  currency,  then  all the  financial  statements  are  translated  at  the closing exchange rate for the period. This hyperinflationary accounting leads to recognition of a gain or loss resulting from exposure to hyperinflation, which is classified as other financial income and expenses and thus included in reserves the following year.\n\nThe effects of index-based restatement and translation of the equity of subsidiaries in Argentina are all included in the translation adjustment in other components of comprehensive income, since restatement  based  on  price  indexes  is  correlated with  movements  in  the  exchange  rate  between  the Argentinian  peso  and  the  euro,  and  mitigates  the effect of the peso's devaluation.\n\nTo determine whether a country is in hyperinflation, the  Group  refers  to  the  list  published  by  the International  Practices  Task  Force  (IPTF)  of  the Center for Audit Quality. The financial statements of the Group's subsidiaries in Argentina are consolidated  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of IAS 29, which have been applied since January 1, 2018. As operations in Iran are no longer consolidated, the Group  has  no  other  subsidiary  in  countries  on  the IPTF list.\n\n## 2-F. Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions  undertaken  in  a  currency  other  than the  functional  currency  of  the  entity  concerned  are initially  translated  to  and  recorded  in  the  functional currency, using the rate applicable at the transaction date.\n\nFor  financial  reporting  purposes,  monetary  assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currency  are  translated  at  the  closing  rate.  All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognized  in  the  income  statement,  except  for foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  financial instruments designated as hedges of a net\n\ninvestment in a foreign entity (Note 2-X). The following impacts are therefore recorded in net income:\n\n- \u25cf translation adjustments related to financial operations by the Automotive  segments  are included in the net financial income;\n- \u25cf other  translation  adjustments  are  included  in  the operating income (operating margin in the information by operating segment).\n\nDerivatives are measured and recorded as described in Note 2-X.\n\nI\n\n05",

Revenues and margin\n\nRevenues  comprise  all  proceeds  from  sales  of  the Group's  automotive  goods,  services  related  to  these sales, and  the  various  Sales  Financing  products marketed by the Group's companies to their customers.\n\n## Sales of goods and services\n\n## Sales and margin recognition\n\nSales  of  automotive  goods  are  recognized  at  the date  control  is  transferred.  The  transfer  of  control over automotive goods takes place when the goods are made available to the distribution network in the case  of  non-Group  dealers  (at  the  time  they  are added to or  removed from stock,  depending  on  the contractual  arrangements)  or  upon  delivery  to  the end-user in the case of direct sales.\n\nHowever, there is no transfer of control in the case of goods  sold  under  an  operating  lease  by  a  Group finance company, or in the case of goods sold with a buy-back  commitment  if  it  is  highly  likely  that  they will  be  returned.  In  such  transactions,  the  revenues are  recognized  progressively  over  the  lease  period, and a used vehicle sale is recorded when control of the  used  vehicle  is  transferred.  The  difference between the price paid by the customer and the buyback  price  is  treated  as  rental  income,  and  spread over  the  period  the  automotive  item  is  at  the customer's disposal. The production cost for the new automotive item concerned is recorded in inventories  for  contracts  of  less  than  one  year,  or included  in  property,  plant  and  equipment  under fixed assets leased to customers when the contracts exceed  one  year.  The  forecast  resale  value  takes account  of  recent  known  developments  on  the second-hand  automotive  market  but  also  future anticipated  developments  over  the  period  in  which the  automotive  goods  will  be  sold,  which  may  be influenced  by  factors  both  external  (economic situation,  taxation)  and  internal  (changes  in  the range  or  the  manufacturer's  pricing  strategy).  As soon as a loss is expected on the resale, a provision (if the  automotive  item  is  in  inventories)  or  additional depreciation  (if  the  automotive  item  is  included  in property,  plant  and  equipment)  is  recognized  to cover the loss.\n\n## Sales incentive programs\n\nSales incentive programs based on the volumes or prices of products sold are deducted from sales when the sales operations concerned are recorded. Any provisions are based on estimates of the most probable amount.\n\nThe Group undertakes certain promotional campaigns offering reduced-interest customer credit or discounts on  services.  Because  these  are  sales  incentives,  the cost of these operations is recognized as a reduction in sales  by  the  Automotive  segments  when  the  vehicle\n\nsale takes place, and is not spread over the duration of the financing or the services concerned.\n\n## Warranty\n\nThe Group makes a distinction between insurance-type warranties and service-type warranties. Provisions are established for insurance-type warranties, while service-type  warranties  give  rise  to  revenue  that  is spread over the duration of the warranty extension.\n\nThe estimated or incurred costs relating to manufacturer's product or part warranties classified as insurance-type  warranties  are  charged  to  expenses when the sales are recorded. Provisions for costs still to be borne are valued on the basis of observed data for each  model  and  engine  regarding  the  level  of  costs, and  their  distribution  over  the  periods  covered  by  the manufacturer's  warranty.  In  the  event  of  product recalls  following  incidents  that  come  to  light  after  the vehicle  has  been  put  on  the  market,  provisions  are established to cover the costs involved as soon as the decision  to  undertake  the  recall  campaign  has  been made.  Amounts  claimed  from  suppliers  are  deducted from  the  warranty  expense  when  it  is  considered practically certain they will be recovered.\n\n## Services related to sales of automotive products\n\nRevenues from service  contracts  sold  by  the  Group are recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. These  contracts  may  be  for  warranty  extensions, maintenance or insurance.\n\nSuch  service  contracts  may  be  sold  separately  to  the final  customer  or  included  free  of  charge  in  a  sale package  covering  a  vehicle  and  related  services.  In either case, the Group considers service contracts as a separate service obligation from delivery of the vehicle, and  allocates  a  portion  of  revenue  to  the  service contract.\n\nWhen the customer makes regular payments for the service  contract,  the  revenue  is  recognized  on  a straight-line basis. When the contract is prepaid (for example, when it is  paid  for  by  the  customer  at  the time of the vehicle purchase), the amounts received are  recorded  as  deferred  income,  and  spread  over the duration of the contract, on a straight-line basis for warranty extensions and following an experience curve for maintenance contracts.\n\n## Impairment of customer receivables\n\nImpairment  is  booked  in  respect  of  the  Automotive segment's customer receivables to reflect the prospective  assessment  of  the  credit  risk  at  the inception  of  the  receivable  and  any  deterioration  of that risk over time. When there is an incurred credit loss, impairment is recorded individually for each receivable.",

These  financing  operations  take  the  form  of loans from the Sales Financing segment companies, and  are  carried  in  the  balance  sheet  at  amortized cost  under  the  effective  interest  rate  method,  less any  impairment.  Income  on  these  contracts  is calculated so as to give a constant interest rate over the period, and is included in sales revenues.\n\n## Sales Financing costs\n\nSales  financing  costs  are  considered  as  operating expenses  and  included  in  the  operating  income (operating  margin  in  the  information  by  operating segment). They mainly comprise interest incurred by sales financing companies  to refinance their customer loan transactions, other costs and revenues  directly  related  to  administration  of  this type of refinancing (temporary investments, hedging and  management  of  exchange  and  interest  rate risks),  and  the  cost  of  risks  related  to  receivables. Refinancing  comes  from  diversified  sources:  public and private bond issues, public and private securitization backed by Automotive segment loans, negotiable  debt  instruments,  savings  collected  and financing  from  credit  institutions  and  assimilate  or the European Central Bank.\n\n## Commissions payable to business intermediaries\n\nCommissions  are  treated  as  external  distribution costs, and therefore deferred as contract acquisition costs, so as to give a constant interest rate over the term of the financing contracts.\n\n## Classification and impairment of receivables\n\nThe  impairment  method  for  financial  receivables depends  on  the  category  concerned.  For  healthy receivables (stage 1), impairment is equivalent to the 12-month  expected  credit  loss;  for  receivables  on which  the  credit  risk  has  significantly  deteriorated since initial recognition or which received extensions during the lockdown  (stage  2), impairment  is equivalent  to  the  lifetime  expected  losses;  and  for receivables  in  default  (stage  3),  impairment  is equivalent to the incurred credit loss.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  uses  an  internal scoring  system  or  external  ratings  to  identify  any significant deterioration in the credit risk. In addition, this segment has decided to use the assumptions set out  in  the  standard  and  thus  downgrades  any receivable outstanding after 30 days to stage 2, and any  receivable  still  outstanding  after  90  days  to stage 3. Receivables in default (stage 3) are identified by  the  Sales  Financing  segment  in  compliance  with the  European  Banking  Authority's  EBA/GL/2016/07 guidelines.  The  Sales  Financing  segment  has  opted for  the  'one  step'  approach,  which  consists  of applying the new definition of default and adjusting its internal  models  concurrently  for  the  Dealer portfolio and Customer portfolio.\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  refers  to  the  current recommendations of the Basel Committee to generate the parameters needed to calculate the probability of default  and  the  loss  rates  in  the  event  of  default  on loans and financing, finance lease receivables, irrevocable  financing  commitments,  and  financial guarantees  given  to  customers  and  dealers  in  its principal countries of business (Germany, Brazil, Spain, France, Italy and the United Kingdom for customer and dealer  financing,  Korea  for  customer  financing  only). For  other  assets,  a  standard  approach  based  on  a simplified methodology is applied.\n\nAs  the  assumptions  used  are  essentially  based  on observable market data, the calculation of impairment for  expected  credit  losses  in  the  Sales  Financing segment  also  incorporates  forward-looking  macroeconomic  data  (GDP,  long-term  rates,  etc)  to  reflect changes in indicators and sector-specific information.\n\nWrite-off rules the gross book value of a financial asset is written off when there are no reasonable expectations of recovery. The asset is derecognized via a  loss  account,  and  the  associated  impairment  is reversed when the non-recoverability of receivables is confirmed,  or  at  the  latest  when  the  Sales  Financing segment's rights as creditor are extinguished. Examples of receivables that become non-recoverable and  are  derecognized  are  waivers  negotiated  with customers  (notably  as  part  of  a  recovery  plan),  timebarred  receivables,  receivables  concerned  by  an unfavourable legal judgement (when the outcome of a lawsuit or litigation is negative), and receivables owed by a customer that no longer exists.\n\nI\n\n05",

Financial income (expenses)\n\nThe cost of net financial indebtedness comprises the cost  of  gross  financial  indebtedness  less  income associated with cash, cash equivalents and financial assets of the Automotive segments. The cost of gross financial  indebtedness  consists  of  income  and expenses  generated  by  the  Automotive  segments' financial  indebtedness  during  the  period,  including the  impact  of  the  effective  portion  of  the  related interest rate hedges.\n\n## 2-I. Income tax\n\nThe Group recognizes deferred taxes for all temporary  differences  between  the  tax  and  book values  of  assets  and  liabilities  in  the  consolidated statement  of  financial  position.  Deferred  taxes  are calculated  at  the  latest  tax  rate  enacted  at  the closing date applicable to the period when temporary differences are reversed. Each individual fiscal  entity  (legal  entity,  establishment  or  group  of entities that pays tax to the tax administration) that is  authorized  to  offset  its  current  tax  assets  and liabilities  reports  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities net.  Recognition  of  deferred  tax  assets  depends  on the probability of future recovery.\n\nFor  associates  and  joint  ventures,  a  deferred  tax liability on  dividend  distributions  is  booked  for\n\n## 2-J. Goodwill\n\nNon-controlling  interests  (formerly  called  'minority interests')  are  carried  at  fair  value  (the  full  goodwill method) or at  their  share  in  the  fair  value  of  assets acquired  and  liabilities transferred  (the  partial goodwill method). To date Renault has only recognized goodwill valued under the partial goodwill method. The choice of which method to use is made for each individual case.\n\nGoodwill  is  not  amortized,  but  impairment  tests  are carried  out  at  least  annually  or  whenever  there  is evidence  of  loss  of  value.  After  initial  recognition, goodwill  is  stated  at  cost  less  any  accumulated impairment.\n\nOther financial income and expenses mainly include foreign exchange gains and losses on financial items and  related  hedges,  the  gain  or  loss  caused  by exposure to hyperinflation (Note 2-E), the net interest on  provisions  for  pensions,  and  dividends  and impairment of companies that are neither controlled nor under significant influence by the Group.\n\ndifferences between the book value and tax value of shares held.\n\nTax credits that can only be used against a taxable profit  are  recorded as a deduction from the income tax payable.  Tax  credits  that  are  recoverable regardless of whether the company makes a taxable profit are set against the relevant nature of expense.\n\nTo  determine  the  provisions  for  uncertain  tax liabilities,  the  Group  uses  a  case-by-case  method based  on  the  most  probable  value.  In  view  of  their qualitative characteristics these provisions are reported  on  specific  lines  in  the  consolidated financial position.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included  in  the  value  of  the  entities  concerned  as reported  in  the  assets  in  the  statement  of  financial position.  In  the  event  of  impairment,  an  impairment loss  is  booked  and  included  in  the  consolidated income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\nAcquisitions  of  additional  investments  concerning non-controlling interests in companies controlled by the  Group  are  treated  as  equity  transactions.  The positive  or  negative  difference  between  the  cost  of acquiring  shares  and  the  book  value  of  the  noncontrolling interests acquired is recorded in shareholders' equity.",

Research and development expenses and other intangible assets\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nDevelopment expenses incurred between the decision  to  begin  development  and  implement production facilities for a new vehicle or component (e.g. engine or gearbox) and the subsequent approval of the design for mass production are capitalized as intangible assets. They are amortized on a straightline  basis  from  the  date  of  approval  for  production, over the expected market life of the vehicle or part, which is initially  no  longer  than  seven  years.  Market lives are regularly reviewed  and  subsequently adjusted if there is a significant difference from the initial  estimate.  Capitalized  development  expenses mainly  comprise  the  cost  of  prototypes,  the  cost  of studies  invoiced  by  external  firms,  the  cost  of personnel  assigned  to  the  project  and  a  share  of overheads  dedicated  exclusively  to  development activities.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the development of a project requiring at least 12 months of preparation before commissioning are included in the  gross  value  of  the  asset,  which  is  a  'qualifying asset'. The capitalization rate for borrowing costs is limited such that capitalized borrowing costs do not exceed  the  total  borrowing  costs  borne  during  the year.  When  a  project  is  financed  through  a  specific\n\nborrowing,  the  capitalization  rate  is  equal  to  the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nExpenses  incurred  before  the  decision  to  begin product  development  are  recorded  as  costs  in  the period they are incurred, in the same way as research expenses. Expenses incurred after the start of mass production are treated as production costs.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther  intangible  assets  comprise  patents,  leasehold rights,  intangible  business  assets,  licences,  software, brands  and  similar  rights  purchased  by  the  Group. When they  have  a  finite  useful  life,  patents,  leasehold rights, licences, brands and similar rights purchased are amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  period  of protection stipulated by the contact or the law, or over the useful life if shorter. Intangible business assets and softwares are amortized over their useful life. The useful life  of  intangible  assets  is  generally  between  3  and 5  years.  Intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite  useful  life, such as the Lada brand (Note 11-C), are subjected to an impairment test at least once a year and when there is any indication of impairment.\n\n## 2-L. Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nThe  gross  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment corresponds  to  historical  acquisition  or  production cost.\n\nDesign and preparation expenses are included in the asset's production cost.\n\nThe production cost for property, plant and equipment  also  includes  financing  costs  borne during  the  construction  phase,  under  the  same method  as  for  intangible  assets.  When  a  project  is financed through a specific borrowing, the capitalization rate is equal to the interest rate on the borrowing.\n\nInvestment  subsidies  received  are,  where  relevant, presented as a deduction from the gross value of the assets concerned.\n\nSubsequent  expenses  for  property, plant and equipment,  except  those  incurred  to  increase productivity  or  prolong  the  life  of  an  asset,  are charged to expenses as incurred.\n\nAssets  leased  to  customers  include  vehicles  leased for  more  than  one  year  from  a  Group  finance company with a buy-back commitment by the Group, and  vehicles  sold  under  an  agreement  including  a clause for buy-back after a minimum one year of use. Assets  leased  to  customers  also  include  vehicles covered  by  operating  leases  longer  than  one  year from Group finance companies, and batteries leased\n\nto electric vehicle users by Group finance companies (Note 2-G).\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group is a party to leases of real estate property (land,  concessions,  warehouses,  offices,  etc)  and movable  property  (IT  and  operating  equipment, transport equipment).\n\nA contract contains a lease if it gives the lessee the right to use an identified asset for a specified period of time in exchange for payment.\n\nAt  the  contract's  commencement  date,  a  lessee recognizes an asset related to the right of use, and a financial liability that represents the lease obligation. The right-of-use asset is amortized over the term of the lease. The lease liability is initially recognized at the  present  value  of  lease  payments  over  the expected term of the lease. The discount is unwound using the implicit interest rate of the lease agreement if it can be readily determined, or at the incremental borrowing rate otherwise. As lessee, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate, calculated  for  each  monetary  zone  as  the  risk-free rate  applicable  in  the  zone,  plus  the  Group's  risk premium  for  the  local  currency.  In  the  income statement,  amortization  of  the  right-of-use  asset  is recorded in the operating income (operating margin in  the  information  by  operating  segment)  and  a\n\nI\n\n05",

The  tax  impact  of  this  consolidation adjustment  is  recognized  via  deferred  taxes.  In  the cash  flow  statement,  cash  flows  from  operating activities  are  impacted  by  interest  expenses  paid, and  cash  flows  from  financing  activities are impacted by the reimbursed lease liability.\n\nLease payments on short-term leases (12 months or less)  and  leases  of  low-value  assets  are  treated  as operating expenses.\n\nThe term of the lease is the non-cancellable period of a lease contract during which the lessee has the right to  use  the  leased  asset,  extended  by  any  renewal options the Group is reasonably certain to exercise.

Lease  term  estimation  and consideration of extension and termination options is conducted  with the help of the real estate department,  considering  the  types  of  site  and  their development plans.\n\nTo  reduce  its  real  estate  footprint  for  a  better  fit  to actual needs, the Group renegotiates property leases (entailing  a  lease  modification)  or  applies  early termination clauses contained in its lease agreements (lease reassessment under IFRS 16).\n\nWhen a lease is renegotiated to shorten the term or reduce  the  space  leased,  the  Group  recognizes  the reassessment of the lease obligation by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate,  and  reduces the book value of the right-of-use asset in the statement of financial position to reflect the partial termination of the lease. The gain or loss resulting from partial termination is recognized in the operating  income  (other  operating  income  and expenses).\n\nWhen  the  term  of  a  lease  is  revised,  the  lease obligation  is  reassessed  by  discounting  the  revised lease  payments  using  a  revised  discount  rate,  and the  right-of-use  asset  is  adjusted  by  the  same amount  in  the  group's  statement  of  financial position.\n\nImprovements  to  leased  buildings  are  depreciated over  a  duration  that  is  equal  to  or  shorter  than  the lease term used to estimate the lease liability (if the lessee has neither the intention nor the ability to use them for a longer period).\n\nWhen  a  lease  contract  contains  a  purchase  option the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to  exercise,  it  is  in substance  a  purchase  rather  than  a  lease.  The corresponding  liability  is  considered  as  a  financial liability  under  IFRS  9,  and  the  asset  as  a  tangible asset in compliance with IAS 16.\n\nProvisions  for  repairs  required  contractually  by lessors are recognized at the start of the lease, with a corresponding tangible asset.\n\nImpairment tests of right-of-use assets are applied at the  level  of  the  cash-generating  unit,  in  accordance with the principles presented in Note 2-M.\n\n## Sale and leaseback operations\n\nIn  application  of  IFRS  16,  for  a  sale  and  leaseback operation, reference is made to the requirements of IFRS 15 to determine whether the transfer of the asset should be treated as a sale or a financing operation.\n\nIf the transfer of an asset does not qualify under IFRS 15  for  recognition  as  a  sale,  the  asset  transferred remains  in  the  assets  reported  in  the  statement  of financial position, and a financial liability equal to the proceeds of the transfer is recognized.\n\nIf the transfer of an asset is recognized as a sale and the  Group  then  leases  back  part  or  all  of  the  asset sold, only the amount of the gain or loss on the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor is recognized, and the right-of-use  asset  is  adjusted  in  proportion  to  the interest  retained  in  the  net  book  value  of  the  asset transferred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nIn  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment and  the  Sales  Financing  segment,  depreciation  is calculated on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n| Buildings  (1)                                      | 15 to 30 years   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Specific tools                                      | 2 to 7 years     |\n| Machinery and other tools  (other than press lines) | 5 to 15 years    |\n| Press lines, stamping  and painting installations   | 20 to 30 years   |\n| Other tangible assets  (2)                          | 4 to 6 years     |\n\n- (1) Buildings in use before 1987 are depreciated over a period of up to 40 years.\n- (2) Except for leased batteries, which are depreciated over periods of 8 to 10 years depending on the models.\n\nUseful lives are regularly reviewed, and accelerated depreciation is  recorded  when an asset's useful life becomes shorter than the initially expected period of use,  particularly  when  it  is  decided  to  withdraw  a vehicle or component from the market.\n\nDepreciation for the AVTOVAZ segment is calculated on a straight-line basis over useful lives that may be longer than those used in other Renault Group companies.",

Impairment\n\n## Impairment of fixed assets\n\nFixed  assets  are  subjected  to  impairment  tests  as soon as there is any indication of a loss of value, such as  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  market  in which  the  company  operates,  or  changes  affecting the circumstances and manner of use of the assets.\n\nFor  the Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment , impairment tests are carried out at two levels:\n\n## At  the  level  of  vehicle-specific  assets  (including components)\n\nVehicle-specific assets (including components) consist  of  capitalized  development  expenses  and tools. Impairment tests are carried out by comparing the net book value of the assets with the recoverable value,  calculated  based  on  discounted  future  cash flows  related  to  the  vehicle  and  its  components. These assets may be specific to the model and/or the country of destination.\n\n## At the level of cash-generating units\n\nA  cash-generating  unit  is  defined  as  a  coherent subset  that  generates  largely  independent  cash flows.  Cash-generating  units  may  represent  an economic  entity  (plant  or  subsidiary)  or  the  whole Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment. Net fixed assets  related  to  cash-generating  units  notably include goodwill, specific assets and capacity assets, and components of working capital.\n\nFor  each  of  the  two  levels,  impairment  tests  are carried out by comparing the net book value with the recoverable  value.  Recoverable  value  is  defined  as the  higher  of  value  in  use  or  fair  value  less  selling costs.\n\nValue in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the use of an asset. Future  cash  flows  derive  from  the  business  plan drawn up and validated by the Management, plus a terminal value based on discounted normative cash flows  after  application  of  a  growth  rate  to  infinity. They also include a bonus ('excess earnings') paid to the  Automotive  segments  for  business  referrals  to the  Sales  Financing  segment.  The  assumptions underlying  the  business  plan  include  estimates  of market developments in countries in which the Group operates and its share of those markets, changes in the  sale  price  of  products  and  the  prices  of\n\nFinancial statements\n\npurchased  components  and  commodities.  The  pretax discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital as determined by the company.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  net book value, impairment equivalent to the difference is recorded against the assets concerned.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment , an impairment test is carried out at least once a year or whenever there is  an  indication  of  loss  of  value,  by  comparing  the book  value  and  recoverable  value  of  assets. Recoverable  value  is  defined  as  the  higher  of  fair value (less selling costs) and value in use. The value in use  is  based  on  a  market  approach,  determined  by using  multiples  for  each  group  of  cash-generating units  made  up  of  legal  entities  or  groups  of  legal entities in the same country.\n\nFor AVTOVAZ ,  impairment tests are also carried out at several levels (specific assets, and the Group as a whole). The AVTOVAZ Group as a whole is considered as  one  cash-generating  unit,  and  no  tests  are conducted  for  individual  factories  or  economic entities.\n\n## Impairment  of  investments  in  associates  and  joint ventures\n\nImpairment  tests  of  the  value  of  investments  in associates and joint ventures are carried out as soon as there is any indication of a loss of value, essentially significant adverse changes in the markets in which the  company  operates,  or  a  major  or  long-term decline in stock market value.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out in compliance with IAS 28 and IAS 36, by comparing the book value of the investment in the associate or joint venture with the recoverable value, which is the higher of value in use and  fair  value,  less  selling  costs.  The  value  in  use  is equal  to  the  share  of  the  present  value  of  future estimated  cash  flows  expected  by  the  associate  or joint venture. If the associate or joint venture is listed, the fair value is its stock market value.\n\nWhen the  recoverable  value  is  lower  than  the  book value,  impairment  equivalent  to  the  difference  is recorded  against  the  relevant  investment  in  an associate or joint venture, and included in the Group's income statement via the share in net income (loss) of associates and joint ventures.\n\nI",

Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  held  for  sale  are  non-current assets  or  groups  of  assets  and  liabilities  that  are available for immediate sale, and are highly likely to be  sold  within  twelve  months  due  to  advanced discussions with a known buyer.\n\nAssets or groups of assets and liabilities considered to be held for sale are measured and recorded at the\n\n## 2-0. Inventories\n\nInventories  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net realizable value. Cost corresponds to acquisition cost or production cost, which includes direct and indirect production expenses and a share of manufacturing overheads, based on a forecast level of activity, and the results of any related hedges. The level of activity is forecast site by site, in order to determine the share of  fixed  costs  to  be  excluded  if  the  actual  level  of activity is lower.\n\nlower of net book value or fair value less selling costs. No  further  depreciation  or  amortization  is  recorded on non-current assets that are classified as held for sale  (or  included  in  a  group  of  assets  and  liabilities held  for  sale).  These  assets  and  liabilities  are reported  on  specific  lines  in  the  statement  of consolidated financial position.\n\nInventories  of  the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ) segment  and  the  Sales  Financing  segment  are valued  under  the  FIFO  (First  In  First  Out)  method. Inventories  of  AVTOVAZ  are  valued  at  weighted average cost.\n\nWhen  the  net  realizable  value  is  lower  than  the financial  position  value,  impairment  equal  to  the difference is recorded.\n\n## 2-P. Assignment of receivables and reverse factoring\n\nReceivables  assigned  to  third  parties  (through securitization, discounting, or factoring) are removed from  Group  assets  when  the  associated  risks  and benefits  are  also  substantially  transferred  to  the third  parties  in  question.  Risk  analysis  principally concerns the credit risk, the risk of late payment and the  country  risk.  The  same  rule  applies  in  the Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  and  the Sales Financing segment.\n\nThe Automotive segments sometimes uses reversefactoring programs. These programs can be used to support  a  supplier,  or  to  benefit  the  Group  by extending  payment  deadlines.  In  the  first  case,  the liability  continues  to  be  considered  as  part  of  the operating cycle and the amounts concerned remain in  trade  payables  in  the  financial  position.  In  the\n\n## 2-Q. Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are shares held for the purposes of stock  option  plans,  performance  share  plans  and other share-based payment arrangements awarded to Group managers and executives.\n\nThey  are  recorded  at  acquisition  cost  and  deducted from Group shareholders' equity until the date of sale.\n\nsecond  case,  if  the  reverse  factoring  contract includes an unconditional commitment by the Group to pay the amount initially due to the supplier to the financial institution that is a party to the contract, the liability  is  no  longer  considered  as  part  of  the operating  cycle  and  the  amounts  concerned  are reclassified as financial liabilities (this has no impact on  the  cash  flow  statement  at  the  reclassification date).\n\nIf  the  contract  is  considered  as  a  financial  liability and  covers  a  financing  requirement  for  the  group subsidiary  involved,  the  repayments  to  financial institutions impact cash flows from financing activities in the cash flow statement; otherwise, they are included in cash flows from operating activities.\n\nWhen these shares are sold, the sale price is directly included in consolidated shareholders' equity. Consequently,  no  gain  or  loss  on  treasury  shares  is included in the net income for the period.",

Performance share plans attribution plans and other share-based payment agreements\n\nThe  Group  awards  performance  shares  and  other share-based payments made in Renault shares. The grant  date  is  the  date  at  which  beneficiaries  are informed  of  the  decision  to  award  performance shares, and the terms of the performance share plan. For  plans  subject  to  performance  conditions,  an estimate  of  achievement  of  the  conditions  is  taken into  account  in  determining  the  number  of  shares awarded.  This  estimate  is  reviewed  annually  based on  changes  in  the  probability  of  performance condition  achievement.  The  final  fair  value  of services rendered in return for performance shares is measured  by  reference  to  the  fair  value  of  those shares at their grant date. Entitlements to performance shares are valued based on the share\n\nvalue  at  the  grant  date  less  dividends  expected during  the  vesting  period.  The  share  price  volatility factor applied is implicit volatility  at  the  grant  date. The expected dividend is determined by reference to the dividend payout schedule announced at the time each plan is valued.\n\nThe total fair value calculated in this way is spread on a  straight-line  basis  over  the  entire  vesting  period. This expense is included in personnel expenses, with a corresponding adjustment to consolidated reserves.  When  the  performance  shares  vest,  the cash amount received by the Group in settlement of the  exercise  price  is  booked  in  cash  and  cash equivalents,  with  a  corresponding  adjustment  to consolidated reserves.\n\n## 2-S. Pensions and other long-term employee benefit obligations\n\nThe  Group's  payments  for  defined-contribution benefit  plans  are  recorded  as  expenses  for  the relevant period.\n\nFor defined-benefit plans concerning postemployment benefits, the Group uses the Projected Unit Credit Method to determine the present value of its obligations.  Under  this  method,  benefits  are attributed  to  periods  of  service  according  to  the plan's  benefit  formula,  principally  on  a  straight-line basis  over  the  years  of  service  that  earn  benefit entitlements.\n\nThe  future  payments  for  employee  benefits  are measured  on  the  basis  of  future  salary  increases, retirement age, mortality and length of employment with  the  company,  and  are  discounted  at  a  rate\n\n## 2-T. Workforce adjustment measures\n\nThe estimated cost of workforce adjustment measures, which for accounting purposes is treated as  an  employee  benefit,  is  covered  by  a  provision over  the  estimated  residual  employment  period  of the employees concerned.\n\nThe cost of termination indemnities is recognized as soon as a detailed plan has either been announced or is in progress. The amount recorded is net of existing provisions for pensions.\n\n## 2-U. Financial assets\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  financial  asset  when  it becomes a party  to  the  contractual  provisions  of  a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial assets  comprise  investments  in  noncontrolled  companies  in  which  Renault  does  not exercise significant influence, marketable securities,\n\nnegotiable  debt  instruments,  loans,  and  derivative assets related to financial transactions (Note 2-X).\n\nThese  instruments  are  presented  as  non-current assets, apart from those maturing within 12 months of the closing date, which are classified as current assets.\n\nI\n\ndetermined by reference to yields on long-term high quality corporate bonds of a duration corresponding to the estimated average duration of the benefit plan concerned.\n\nThe  actuarial  gains  and  losses  resulting  from revisions of the underlying assumptions and experience-based adjustments are included in other components of comprehensive income.\n\nThe  net  expense  for  the  year,  corresponding  to  the current period service cost plus the past service cost where relevant,  is  charged  to  the  operating  income (operating  margin  in  the  information  by  operating segment).  The  interest  expense  on  the  net  definedbenefit liability (asset) is recorded in the net financial income and expenses.\n\n05",

The  fair  values  of  such  financial assets are determined in priority by reference to the market price. If this is not possible, the Group uses a valuation method that is not based on market data.\n\nIn an exception to this rule, by virtue of an irrevocable option  the  Daimler  shares  were  presented  at  fair value in other components of comprehensive income until their disposal in 2021.\n\n## Marketable securities and negotiable debt instruments\n\nShort-term  investments  in  the  form  of  marketable securities  and  negotiable  debt  instruments  are undertaken for  the  management  of  cash  surpluses,\n\n## 2-V. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  includes  cash  on  hand,  current  accounts  and other  demand  deposits,  with  the  exception  of  bank overdrafts, which are included in financial liabilities.\n\nCash  equivalents  are  investments  held  for  the purpose  of  meeting  short-term  cash  commitments. For an investment to qualify as a cash equivalent, it must be considered as liquid,  be  readily  convertible for  a  known  amount  of  cash  and  be  subject  to  an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\nbut do not meet the requirements to qualify as cash equivalents.  These  are  debt  instruments  carried  at fair value through other components of comprehensive income, except for shares in investment  funds  (UCITS)  which  are  carried  at  fair value through profit and loss.\n\nImpairment  equivalent  to  expected  credit  losses  is booked upon initial  recognition  of  debt  instruments carried  at  fair  value  through  other  components  of comprehensive income.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans  essentially  include  loans  for  investment  of cash  surpluses  and  loans  to  associates.  Loans  are carried  at  amortized  cost.  Impairment  equivalent  to expected  credit  losses  is  recognized  upon  initial recognition  of  the  financial  asset,  and  when  there  is objective evidence of loss of value caused by an event arising after the initial recognition.\n\nThese  instruments  are  stated  at  amortized  cost except for shares in investment funds (UCITS) which are carried at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nBank accounts subject to restrictions due to sectorspecific regulations (for example, banking or insurance regulations) or bank accounts allocated to increasing  credit  on  securitized  receivables  are included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## 2-W. Financial liabilities of the Automotive segments and Sales Financing debts\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  financial  liability  (for  the Automotive  segments)  or  a  Sales  Financing  debt when  it  becomes  a  party  to  the  contractual provisions of a financial instrument.\n\nFinancial liabilities and  Sales  Financing  debts comprise  participating  shares,  subordinated  debt, bonds,  other  debts  represented  by  a  certificate, borrowings from credit institutions, lease liabilities in application  of  IFRS  16  (Notes  2-L),  other  interestbearing borrowings and derivative liabilities  related to financial transactions (Note 2-X).\n\nParticipating shares of the Automotive segments are listed  subordinated  debt  instruments  that  earn  a variable  return  indexed  on  consolidated  revenues. They  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  determined  by\n\ndiscounting  forecast  coupons  using  the  effective interest rate on borrowings. The estimated effective interest  rate  takes  account  of  indexation,  and  the amortized  cost  recorded  in  financial  result  is  reestimated  when  there  is  a  significant  change  in future  sales  prospects,  particularly  when  mediumterm business plans are released.\n\nFinancial liabilities not concerned by specific hedge accounting methods  (Note 2-X) are generally recorded  at  amortized  cost  using  the  effective interest rate method. Financial expense calculated in this way includes issuance expenses and issuance or redemption  premiums,  together  with  the  impact  of debt renegotiations when the old and new terms are not substantially different.",

This  fair value is subsequently reviewed at each closing date.\n\n- \u25cf The fair  value  of  forward  exchange  contracts  and currency swaps is determined by discounting future cash flows, using closing-date market rates (exchange and interest rates).\n- \u25cf The  fair  value  of  interest  rate  derivatives  is  the amount  the  Group  would  receive  (or  pay)  to  settle outstanding contracts at the closing date, taking into account interest rates forward curves and the quality of  the  counterparty  to  each  contract  at  the  closing date. This fair value includes accrued interest.\n- \u25cf The fair value of commodity derivatives is based on market conditions.\n\nThe  Automotive  segments'  derivatives  are  reported in  the  financial  position  as  current  if  they  mature within 12 months and non-current otherwise. All Sales Financing  segment  derivatives  are  reported  in  the financial position as current.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe  treatment  of  derivatives  designated  as  hedging instruments depends on the type of hedging relationship:\n\n- \u25cf fair value hedge;\n- \u25cf cash flow hedge;\n- \u25cf hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe  Group  identifies  the  hedging  instrument  and  the hedged  item  as  soon  as  the  hedge  is  set  up,  and documents  the  hedging  relationship,  stating  the hedging strategy, the risk hedged and the method used to assess the hedge's effectiveness. The Sales Financing  segment  documents  hedging  relationships concerning one or more homogeneous items to cover its  risks.  This  documentation  is  subsequently  updated such  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  designated  hedge can be demonstrated.\n\nHedge  accounting  uses  specific  measurement  and recognition methods for each category of hedge.\n\n- \u25cf Fair  value  hedges:  the  hedged  item  is  adjusted  to fair  value  up  to  the  risk  hedged  and  the  hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. As changes in these items are recorded in the income statement simultaneously,  only  the  ineffective  portion  of  the hedge has an impact on net income. It is recorded in the same income statement item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u25cf Cash  flow  hedges:  no  adjustment  is  made  to  the value  of  the  hedged  item;  only  the  hedging instrument  is  adjusted  to  fair  value.  Following  this adjustment,  the  effective  portion  of  the  change  in fair value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  is recorded,  net  of  taxes,  in  other  components  of comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion  is  included  in  net  income.  The  cumulative amount included in shareholders' equity is transferred  to  the  income  statement  when  the hedged item has an impact on net income.\n- \u25cf Hedge of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation: the  hedging  instrument  is  adjusted  to  fair  value. Following  this  adjustment,  the  effective  portion  of the change in fair value attributable to the hedged exchange  risk  is  recorded,  net  of  taxes,  in  other components  of  comprehensive  income,  while  the ineffective  portion  is  included  in  net  income.  The cumulative amount included in shareholders' equity is transferred  to  net  income  at  the  date  of liquidation  or  sale  of  the  investment.  The  interest rate component of borrowings in yen used to hedge the  investment  in  Nissan  is  considered  as  the ineffective  portion,  and  is  therefore  recorded directly in financial income and expenses.\n\n## Derivatives not designated as hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated as  hedges  are  recognized  directly  in  financial  income, except in the case of derivatives entered into exclusively for reasons closely related to business operations. In this case, changes in the fair value of derivatives are included in the  operating  income  (operating  margin  in  the information by operating segment).\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n05",

Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment\n\n- \u25cf In May 2021 the Group set up a joint venture Hyvia, owned in equal shares with the partner Plug Power Inc. This joint venture provides a full ecosystem of turnkey  solutions  comprising  fuel  cell-powered light commercial  vehicles,  hydrogen  charging stations,  supplies  of  carbon-free  hydrogen,  and fleet maintenance and management. It is valued at \u20ac4  million,  and  accounted  for  under  the  equity method.\n- \u25cf In July 2021, the Group acquired a minority stake of 23.64%  in  French  start-up  Verkor  for  the  purchase price of \u20ac25 million, with a view to co-developing a high-performance battery. The partnership will also involve  development  of  a  pilot  production  line  for battery  cell  and  module  prototyping  in  France starting in 2022. In a second phase, Verkor aims to construct  France's  first gigafactory  for  highperformance batteries in France from 2026, with an initial capacity  of  10  GWh  for  Renault  Group, potentially  rising  to  20  GWh  by  2030.  The  Group holds  derivative  instruments  that  will  entitle  it  to subscribe  to  future  capital  increases  by  Verkor while  remaining  a  minority  shareholder,  subject  to conditions  concerning  development  of  the  highperformance  battery.  As  an  entity  subject  to significant influence, Verkor is accounted for under the equity method. The provisional goodwill on this operation is \u20ac9 million.\n- \u25cf In September 2021, the Group acquired a 21.28% investment and joint control of French startup  Whylot  for  the  purchase  price  of  \u20ac10  million. Whylot  is  developing  an  innovative  axial-flux electric motor. Renault Group is the beneficiary of a unilateral  promise  of  sale  that  will  enable  it  to acquire  70%  of  Whylot  and  take  control  of  the company,  provided  Renault  places  an  order  by September  1,  2023.  The  purchase  price  is  to  be determined by expert assessment and capped at a maximum  enterprise  value  of  \u20ac80  million.  Whylot, as a joint venture, is accounted for under the equity method. The provisional goodwill on this operation is \u20ac9 million.\n\n- \u25cf On December 31, 2021, the Group grouped its three factories in the north of France at Douai, Ruitz and Maubeuge  to  form  Renault  ElectriCity,  by  partial business  transfers  from  the  entities  SNC  Renault Douai,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Transmissions  Automatiques (STA)  and  Maubeuge  Construction  Automobile (MCA),  which  have  all  retained  their  land  assets. Renault ElectriCity will begin operations on January 1, 2022.\n- \u25cf In  April  2021,  the  Group  ceased  all  commercial operations  by  its  Australian  subsidiary  Vehicle Distributors  Australia  and  transferred  its  assets  to an  importer  that  now  takes  charge  of  selling Renault  and  Dacia  brand  vehicles  in  Australia. Vehicle Distributors Australia is now in liquidation.\n- \u25cf In  April  2021,  the  Group  sold  its  40%  minority shareholding  in  Renault  South  Africa,  an  entity accounted  for  under  the  equity  method,  to  the majority shareholder Motus Corporation Proprietary Ltd for the price of \u20ac15 million.\n- \u25cf In  November  2021,  the  Group  sold  its  distribution subsidiary Renault Nissan Wien to a private dealer for the price of \u20ac6 million (excluding real estate assets).\n- \u25cf In December 2021, Renault s.a.s. disposed of its 98% investment  in  Carizy  through  an  exchange  for 3.25% of Mobility Trader Holding GmbH. RCI Banque concurrently made a \u20ac30 million investment in the same  entity,  thus  acquiring  4.97%  of  its  capital (Note  3-C)  for  the  purposes  of  the  Heycar  used vehicle platform project. As the Group has a seat on the  Board  of  Directors,  Mobility  Trader  Holding GmbH is subject to significant influence and is thus accounted for under the equity method at the value of \u20ac50 million at December 31, 2021.\n- \u25cf The  joint  ventures  Alliance  Mobility  Company France  and  Alliance  Mobility  Company  Japan,  set up with Nissan in June 2019 to conduct research into driverless cars, no longer have any activity and are currently  in  liquidation.  Their  projects  are  now handled by Renault s.a.s.",

AVTOVAZ\n\n- \u25cf Following  a  capital  increase  by  capitalization  of receivables, Renault Group's percentage ownership in the Netherlands-based holding company Alliance  Rostec  Auto  b.v.  increased  from  67.61%  to 67.69% during the second half of 2021. In December 2021,  Alliance  Rostec  Auto  b.v.  transferred  all  its shares  in  AVTOVAZ  to  LADA  Auto  Holding  OOO,  a Russian-based company set up in September 2021. This transfer has no consequences  for  the consolidated financial statements. Renault's percentage  ownership  in  LADA  Auto  Holding  OOO and AVTOVAZ was 67.69% at December 31, 2021, the same  as  the  percentage  ownership  in  Alliance Rostec Auto b.v. and AVTOVAZ prior to the transfer of the AVTOVAZ shares to LADA Auto Holding OOO. Alliance  Rostec  Auto  b.v.  was  in  the  process  of liquidation at December 31, 2021.\n- \u25cf In December  2021,  AVTOVAZ  acquired  a  40% investment  in  its  components  supplier  JSC  OAT and  its  subsidiaries,  for  the  purchase  price  of\n\n## 3-C. Sales Financing\n\n- \u25cf In July 2021, RCI Banque acquired all the shares in the  Spanish  company  BI-PI  Mobility  SL  and  its subsidiaries,  which  specialize  in  flexible  vehicle rentals,  for  the  purchase  price  of  \u20ac67  million. The  provisional  goodwill  on  this  operation  is \u20ac68 million.\n- \u25cf In  December 2021, RCI Banque made a \u20ac30 million investment  to  acquire  4.97%  of  Mobility  Trader Holding  GmbH,  concurrently  with  Renault  s.a.s.' exchange  of  its  Carizy  shares  (Note  3-A).  Mobility Trader Holding GmbH manages the online used car platform Heycar. This investment is accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## 3-D. Mobility Services\n\n- \u25cf The Group is rolling out its knowhow in recharging infrastructures and solutions across Europe, through  subsidiaries  and  joint  ventures  owned jointly with  Elto  Holding,  operating  under  the Mobilize  Power  Solutions  brand.  Elto  Holding  is  a French-based subsidiary of Renault s.a.s. that holds the following European entities, which have all been fully  consolidated  since  their  formation  during  the first  half-year  of  2021:  Elto  BeLux  and  Elto  DACH\n\n## 3-E. Non-current assets held for sale\n\nIn application of its strategic plan 'Renaulution', the Group  has  started  to  sell  certain  real  estate  assets (land,  industrial  sites),  branches  (in  France)  and vehicle distribution subsidiaries (outside France).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the group of assets held for sale consists of \u20ac129 million of assets and \u20ac182 million of debts  and  other  liabilities.  The  difference  between these amounts at December 31, 2021 and the amounts reported in the financial statements at June 30, 2021,\n\nGmbH owned 51%, Elto Iberia s.l. Unipersonal owned 60%,  Elto  UK  and  Elto  Italy  S.r.l.  owned  100%.  Elto France, a joint venture owned 40%, is accounted for under the equity method.\n\n- \u25cf In December 2021, the Group exercised its option to buy  minority  interests  in  Coolnagour  Ltd  (iCabbi), and now owns all the shares of that entity  and  its subsidiaries, as opposed to 78% previously.\n\ni.e.  a  \u20ac265  million decrease in assets held for sale, is mainly explained by sales that took place during the second half of 2021, including \u20ac214 million concerning property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill (see Note 6-C).\n\nThe reclassification of these assets held for sale and the associated liabilities is reflected in other changes in the relevant notes.\n\nI\n\nFinancial statements\n\n847 million roubles (\u20ac10 million). AVTOVAZ has joint control and  accounts  for  JSC  OAT  and  its subsidiaries under the equity method. The shareholder  agreements  include  an  exit  option after two years and successful implementation of a business recovery plan. If the plan succeeds, the resale  price  is  set  at  1  billion  roubles.  If  it  fails, AVTOVAZ will receive 100% of the shares in three subsidiaries  of  JSC  OAT  in  exchange  for  its  40% stake  in  JSC  OAT.  The  provisional    negative goodwill  on  this  operation  is  184  million  roubles (\u20ac2 million).\n\n- \u25cf In December  2021,  LADA  ZAPAD  (formerly  GM AVTO), purchased from the General Motors group in 2019, was merged with PAO AVTOVAZ.\n- \u25cf During the second half-year of 2021, AVTOVAZ sold three  distribution  subsidiaries  operating  in  Russia, AO  Saransk-Lada,  AO  Oka-Lada    and  OA  SarovLada, for the price of \u20ac4 million.\n\n05",

These plans  are  part  of  the  3-year  trade  union  agreement 'Re-Nouveau  France  2025'  signed  on  December  14, 2021.  Through  this  key  agreement  Renault  Group  is making France the strategic and industrial centre of its  promising  future  businesses,  to  strengthen  the Group  in its home  country,  contribute  to its transformation  and  carry  all  its  French  businesses towards the automotive industry's new value chain.\n\nRestructuring  and  workforce  adjustment  costs  in 2021 also concern restructuring plans outside France (principally  in  South  Korea,  Spain  and  Romania) undertaken as part of the plan to reduce fixed costs announced on May 29, 2020.\n\nIn 2020, restructuring and workforce adjustment costs included  \u20ac(115)  million  for  a  work  exemption  plan  in France  which  eligible  employees  could  join  between April 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021,  and provisions relating to  the  agreement to transform technical and service skills  in  preparation  for  future  developments  in  the automotive world, signed in France in November 2020. This  agreement was part of the plan to reduce fixed costs by more than \u20ac2 billion over 3 years, including a workforce  reduction  by  4,600  employees  in  France and  10,000  employees  worldwide,  announced  in May  2020.

Impairment tests on vehicle-specific assets (including components) and the assets of certain entities\n\nFollowing impairment  tests of specific assets dedicated  to  vehicles  (including  components)  and assets  belonging  to  certain  entities,  impairment  of \u20ac(78) million was booked during 2021 (\u20ac(762) million in 2020),  comprising  \u20ac(48)  million  for  intangible  assets (\u20ac(565) million in 2020), and \u20ac(30) million for property, plant  and  equipment  (\u20ac(197)  million  in  2020).

Impairment tests of country-specific assets or cash-generating units of the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment\n\n## Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment\n\nThe  recoverable  value  used  for  the  purpose  of impairment  tests  for  the  Automotive  (excluding\n\nAVTOVAZ)  segment  is  the  value  in  use,  determined under the discounted future cash flow method on the basis of the following assumptions:\n\n|                         | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Growth rate to infinity | 1.0%                | 1.2%                |\n| After-tax discount rate | 8.9%                | 9.2%                |\n\nThe  assumptions  used  for  impairment  testing  at December 31, 2021 are derived from the medium-term plan for the period 2021-2025, which was presented in January 2021 and updated in late 2021.

The  recoverable  value  of  the  assets tested would remain higher than the book value in the event of the following changes in those assumptions:\n\n- \u25cf A growth rate to infinity of 0%.\n- \u25cf An after-tax discount rate of 10%.\n\n## 11-C. Impairment tests on the AVTOVAZ cash-generating unit\n\nAVTOVAZ  was  delisted  from  the  Moscow  stock exchange in May 2019, and consequently reference is no longer made to its market capitalization to assess the  recoverable  value  of  its  net  assets,  including goodwill which amounts to \u20ac727 million (62,004  million  rubles)  and  a  depreciable  brand amounting  to  \u20ac108  million  (9,248  million  rubles)  at December  31,  2021  (respectively  \u20ac678  million  and \u20ac101 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nIn application of the approach presented in the note on accounting policies (Note 2-M), the annual impairment test of AVTOVAZ was conducted at December 31, 2021.

Nissan consolidation method\n\nRenault  Group  and  the  Japanese  automakers  Nissan and Mitsubishi have developed an alliance between their three distinct companies with common interests, uniting forces to achieve optimum performance. The Alliance is organized  so  as  to  preserve  individual  brand  identities and respect each company's corporate culture.\n\n## Consequently:\n\n- \u25cf Renault Group is not assured of holding the majority of voting rights in Nissan's Shareholders' Meeting.\n- \u25cf The terms of the Renault Group-Nissan agreements do not entitle Renault Group to appoint the majority of Nissan directors, nor to hold the majority of voting rights  at  meetings  of  Nissan's  Board  of  Directors; Renault Group cannot unilaterally appoint the CEO of Nissan.\n\n- \u25cf In  March  2019,  Renault  Group,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi announced the creation of the new Alliance Operating Board  (AOB)  which  oversees  Alliance  operations  and governance. The Alliance Operating Board consists of the Chairman of the Board of Renault Group, the Chief Executive Officer of Renault Group, the Chief Executive Officer  of  Nissan  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of Mitsubishi Motors. Orientations are taken by consensus.  In  November  2019,  the  AOB  appointed  an Alliance  Secretary  General,  who  reports  to  the  AOB and the CEOs of the three alliance companies.\n- \u25cf At December 31, 2021, Renault Group occupied two seats  on  Nissan's  Board  of  Directors  and  was represented by Jean-Dominique Senard, Chairman of  the  Renault  Group  Board  and  Pierre  Fleuriot, Lead Director in Renault Group.\n\nbrand which were both recognized when Renault Group took control of AVTOVAZ.\n\nThe  value  in  use  was  calculated  using  an  after-tax discount  rate  of  15.2%,  an  assumption  that  volumes would return to their pre-Covid 19 pandemic levels in 2022,  and  a  growth  rate  to  infinity  (including  the effect of inflation) of 3.2%.\n\nThe  test  results  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any impairment at December 31, 2021 and no reasonably possible  change  in  the  main  assumptions  used should  lead  to  a  recoverable  value  below  the  book value of the assets tested.",

Nissan consolidated financial statements included under the equity method in the Renault Group consolidation\n\nThe  Nissan  accounts  included  under  the  equity method in Renault Group's financial statements are Nissan's consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards (as Nissan is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange), after adjustments  for  the  requirements  of  the  Renault Group consolidation.\n\nNissan  publishes  consolidated  financial  statements quarterly, and annually at March 31. For the purposes of  the  Renault  Group  consolidation,  Nissan  results\n\nare included in line with the Renault Group calendar (the  results  for  the  period  January  to  December  are consolidated  in  Renault  Group's  annual  financial statements).\n\nNissan  held  0.6%  of  its  own  treasury  shares  at December  31,  2021  (0.7%  at  December  31,  2020).

Hedging of the investment in Nissan\n\nThe  Group  has  partially  hedged  the  yen/euro exchange risk on its investment in Nissan since 1999. Details of this hedge are given in Note 25-B2.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  corresponding  hedging operations  totaled  \u00a518.3  billion  (\u20ac140  million)  of\n\nprivate placements in bonds issued directly in yen on the Japanese Samurai bond market.\n\nIn  2021  foreign  exchange  differences  generated  a favourable  effect  of  \u20ac4  million  (foreign  exchange gains and losses offset each other in 2020).\n\n## 12-H. Valuation of Renault Group's investment in Nissan at stock market prices\n\nBased on the quoted price at December 31, 2021 of \u00a5556 per  share,  Renault  Group's  investment  in  Nissan  is\n\nvalued  at  \u20ac7,812  million  (\u20ac8,110  million  at  December  31, 2020 based on the price of \u00a5560 per share).\n\n## 12-I. Impairment test of the investment in Nissan\n\nAt  December 31, 2021,  the  stock  market  value  of  the investment was 51.9% lower than the value of Nissan in  Renault  Group's  statement  of  financial  position (44.5% at December 31, 2020).\n\nIn application of the approach presented in the Note on accounting policies, an impairment test was carried out at  December  31,  2021.  An  after-tax  discount  rate  of 6.53% and a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.47% were used to calculate value in use. The  terminal  value  was  calculated  under  profitability assumptions  consistent  with  Nissan's  past  data  and conservative medium and long-term prospects,\n\nincorporating new medium-term forecasts for volumes and exchange rates.\n\nThe  test  result  did  not  lead  to  recognition  of  any impairment on the investment in Nissan at December 31, 2021  and  it  is  considered  that  a  reasonably possible  change  in  the  main  assumptions  used should  not  result  in  a  recoverable  value  lower  than the book value of the investment in Nissan.\n\nThe  same  conclusion  was  reached  following  the impairment  test  performed  at  December  31,  2020 applying  an  after-tax  discount  rate  of  6.21%  and  a growth rate to infinity (including the effect of inflation) of 1.71%.\n\n## 12-J. Operations between Renault Group and the Nissan Group\n\n## 12-J1. Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) and Sales Financing\n\nRenault  Group  and  Nissan  follow  joint  strategies  for vehicle  and  component  development,  purchasing, production and distribution resources. This cooperation is reflected in synergies that reduce costs.\n\nThe  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  is involved in operations with Nissan on two levels:\n\n- \u25cf Industrial  production:  cross-over  production  of vehicles and components in the Alliance's manufacturing plants:\n- \u25cf Sales by Renault Group to the Nissan group in 2021 totalled approximately \u20ac1,763 million (\u20ac1,785 million in 2020),  comprising  around  \u20ac1,065  million  for vehicles  (\u20ac1,017  million  in  2020),  \u20ac579million  for components (\u20ac669 million in 2020), and \u20ac119 million for services (\u20ac99 million in 2020).\n- \u25cf Purchases by Renault Group from the Nissan group in 2021 totalled approximately  \u20ac1,559  million (\u20ac1,361 million in2020), comprising around \u20ac1,206  million  of  vehicles  (\u20ac1,000  million  in  2020), \u20ac226 million  of  components  (\u20ac277  million  in  2020), and \u20ac127 million of services (\u20ac84 million in 2020).\n- \u25cf The balance of Renault Group receivables on the Nissan group is \u20ac424 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac463  million  at  December  31,  2020)  and  the balance of Renault Group liabilities to the Nissan group  is  \u20ac607  million  at  December  31,  2021 (\u20ac664 million at December 31, 2020).\n- \u25cf Finance: In addition to its activity for Renault Group, Renault  Finance  acts  as  the  Nissan  group's counterparty  in  financial  instrument  trading  to hedge  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risks. Renault Finance undertook approximately \u20ac12.4  billion  of  forex  transactions  on  the  foreign exchange market for Nissan in 2021 (\u20ac9.9 billion  in 2020). Operations  undertaken  with  Nissan  on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are recorded  at  market  price  and  included  in  the positions  managed  by  Renault  Finance.  In  the balance sheet, the derivative assets on the Nissan group  amount  to  \u20ac11  million  at  December  31,  2021 (\u20ac36  million  at  December  31,  2020)  and  derivative liabilities amount to \u20ac34 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac35 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nRenault  Group's  Sales  Financing  segment  helps  to attract customers and build loyalty to Nissan brands through a range of financing products and services incorporated  into  the  sales  policy,  principally  in",

Both  types  of  operation  are  conducted through  special  purpose  vehicles.  Some  public operations  were  subscribed  by  RCI  Banque,  which makes  it  possible  to  have  securities  eligible  as collateral for the European Central Bank.\n\nIn 2021, the Sales Financing segment placed a public automotive  loan-backed  securitization  in  Germany, and  issued  \u20ac900  million  of  senior  instruments  (of which \u20ac200 million were self-subscribed).\n\nThe receivables assigned through such operations are not derecognized, as all risks are retained by the Group. The  associated  liabilities  correspond  to  securities resulting  from  the  securitization  operations,  and  are recognized in other debts represented by a certificate.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  receivables  assigned and the amount  of the associated liabilities corresponds to the higher credit necessary for these operations,  and  the  share  of  securities  retained  by RCI Banque to form a liquidity reserve.\n\nSecuritized  assets  can  no  longer  be  assigned  or pledged.  Subscribers  to  debt  securities  only  have claims on the assets assigned.\n\nAssets  pledged  as  guarantees  for  management  of the liquidity reserve are presented in Note 28-A.4.\n\n## 15-C.

Breakdown of sales financing receivables by level of risk\n\nThe Sales Financing segment launched its compliance programme for  the  new  definition  of  default  in  2018, opting for the 'One Step' approach, which consists of adjusting  its  internal  models  concurrently  for  the Dealer portfolio and Customer portfolio.\n\nFor countries whose solvency ratio is calculated by the advanced approach (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, the United  Kingdom  and  South  Korea),  the  ECB's  work  on new  default  calibration  was  finalized  in  December 2020, leading to a non-significant increase in provisions.\n\nFor  countries  whose  solvency  ratio  is  calculated  by the standard approach (Brazil and non-G7 countries), the new definition of default has been applied to the Customer and Dealer portfolios since January 1, 2021. This has led to an increase in impaired receivables in Brazil (and consequently a decrease in the provisioning  rate  of  those  receivables)  but  had  no impact on non-G7 countries.\n\nI",

Exposure of sales financing to credit risk\n\nThe  maximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  for  the  Sales Financing  activity  is  represented  by  the  net  book value of sales financing receivables plus the amount of irrevocable financing commitments for customers reported  under  off-balance  sheet  commitments given (Note 28-A). This risk is reduced by guarantees provided  by  customers,  as  reported  in  off-balance sheet commitments received (Note 28-B). In particular, guarantees  held  in  connection  with overdue  or  impaired  sales  financing  receivables\n\namounted  to  \u20ac805  million  at  December  31,  2021 (\u20ac866 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nCustomer  credit  risk  is  assessed  (using  a  scoring system)  and  monitored  by  type  of  activity  (customers and dealers). There is no indication at the year-end that the quality of sales financing receivables not yet due or unimpaired  has  been  adversely  affected,  nor  is  there any  significant  concentration  of  risks  within  the  sales financing customer base as defined by the regulations.",

Share capital\n\nThe total number of ordinary shares issued and fully paid  at  December  31,  2021  is  295,722  thousand,  with par  value  of  \u20ac3.81  per  share  (unchanged  since December 31, 2020).\n\nTreasury shares do not bear dividends. They account for 1.55% of Renault SA's share capital at December 31, 2021 (1.53% at December 31, 2020).\n\n## 18-B. Capital management\n\nIn  managing  its  capital,  the  Group's  objective  is  to guarantee continuity of business in order to provide returns  for  shareholders  and  benefits  for  other stakeholders,  and  to  maintain  optimum  capital structure in order to optimize its cost. The Group may adjust  dividend  payments  to  shareholders,  redeem some of the capital or issue new shares.\n\nThe  Group's  objectives  are  monitored  in  different ways in the different operating segments.\n\n## 18-C. Renault treasury shares\n\nIn  accordance  with  decisions  approved  at  General Shareholders'  Meetings,  the  Board  of  Directors decided  to  allocate  all  Renault  treasury  shares  to\n\ncurrent  stock  option  and  performance  share  plans and other share-based payment agreements awarded to Group managers and executives.\n\n|                                           | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Total value of treasury plans (\u20ac million) | 237                 | 284                 |\n| Total number of treasury shares           | 4,582,464           | 4,538,199           |\n\n## 18-D. Distributions\n\nAt  the  General  and  Extraordinary  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  April  23,  2021,  it  was  decided  not  to  distribute dividends (no change compared to 2020).\n\nThe  Nissan  Group  holds  approximately  15%  of Renault  SA  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary Nissan Finance Co. Ltd (no voting rights are attached to these shares).\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  must  comply  with regulatory  ratios  specific  to  banking  operations. The  minimum  solvency  ratio  (shareholders'  equity including subordinated loans to total weighted risks) is 8%. RCI Banque's Core Tier 1 solvency ratio is 14.76% at December 31, 2021 (17.34% at December 31, 2020).\n\nThe  Group  also  partially  hedges  its  investment  in Nissan (Notes 12-G and 25-B2).",

In  2020,  the  effects  of  the  partial\n\nhedge  of  the  net  investment  in  Nissan  offset  each other.  Other  changes  in  the  translation  adjustment mostly  result  from  movements  in  the  Russian  ruble and the Brazilian real.\n\n## 18-F. Financial instrument revaluation reserve\n\n## 18-F1.

Performance share plans and other share-based payments arrangements\n\nThe Board of Directors periodically awards performance shares to Group executives and managers, with vesting and minimum holding periods specific  to  each  plan.  All  plans  include  performance conditions which determine the number of performance  shares  granted  to  beneficiaries.

A  liability  corresponding  to  these  put  options  is included in other liabilities, amounting to \u20ac102 million for the  Brazilian  subsidiary,  \u20ac4  million  for  the Argentinian  subsidiary,  and  \u20ac63  million  for  the Colombian  subsidiary  at  December  31,  2021  (\u20ac100 million,  \u20ac4  million  and  \u20ac61  million  respectively  at December 31, 2020). A corresponding charge is made to  shareholders'  equity,  allocated  in  priority  to  the non-controlling  interests'  share  with  any  residual amount allocated to the parent-company shareholders'  share.  The  liability  is  stated  at  fair value.  Fair  value  is  determined  by  estimating  the potential  purchase price,  taking  into  account  future results  of  the  financing  portfolio  as  it  exists  at  the\n\nclosing  date  and  the  provisions  of  the  partnership contracts.  This  is  a  level  3  fair  value,  as  it  uses recognized models but their significant data are not based on observable market data.\n\nPartnership  agreements  were  signed  in  2018  with Oyak  in  Turkey,  including  put  and  call  options  (see Note  28-A3).  The  Group  also  holds  call  options  for shares in several entities in the Oyak group (Note 28-B).\n\nThere  are  no  significant  restrictions  on  the  Group's capacity  to  access  or  use  its  assets  and  settle  its liabilities, other than restrictions that result from the regulatory  framework  in  which  the  subsidiaries operate.  The  local  supervisory  authorities  may require banking subsidiaries to keep a certain level of capital  and  liquidities,  limit  their  exposure  to  other group parties, and comply with other ratios.",

Pension and benefit plans\n\nPensions  and  other  long-term  employee  benefit obligations  essentially  concern  active  employees. These  benefits  are  covered  either  by  definedcontribution plans or defined-benefit plans.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nThe  Group  makes  earnings-related  payments,  in accordance  with  local  custom,  to  the  national organizations  responsible  for  paying  pensions  and similar  financial  benefits.  There  is  no  actuarial liability concerning these pension arrangements.\n\nThe total expense for defined-contribution plans was \u20ac393 million in 2021 (\u20ac415 million in 2020).\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nThe accounting treatment of defined-benefit plans is described in Note 2-S and involves establishment of provisions. These plans concern:\n\n- \u25cf indemnities payable upon retirement or departure, in application  of  legislation  or  agreements  in certain countries such as France, Turkey, etc;\n- \u25cf supplementary pensions providing employees with contractual income; the countries applying this type of  plan  are  in  Europe  (e.g.  the  United  Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, etc);\n- \u25cf other long-term benefits, chiefly long-service awards, and flexible holiday entitlements.\n\nDefined-benefit  supplementary  pension  plans  are generally covered by contracts with pension funds or insurance companies. In such cases, the obligations and  assets  are  valued  separately.  The  difference between  the  obligation  and  the  fair  value  of  the assets held to  fund  it  may  indicate  underfunding  or overfunding. In the event of underfunding, a provision is  booked.  In  the  event  of  overfunding,  an  asset  is recognized subject to certain conditions.\n\n## Principal defined-benefit plans of the Group\n\nIn  France,  the  Group's  retirement  indemnities  result from agreements negotiated with each French entity and  employee  representatives.  They  are  based  on employees' salaries and length of service; payment is conditional  on  being  in  the  company's  employment\n\nat the time of retirement. Retirement  benefit obligations  for  France  are  entirely  covered  by provisions,  and  account  for  most  of  the  Group's liabilities for retirement indemnities.\n\nThe Group's most significant supplementary pension plan  is  in  the  United  Kingdom,  where  two  definedbenefit  pension  plans  are  managed  as  part  of a dedicated pension fund comprising two compartments: one concerns Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ)  subsidiaries  and  the  other  RCI  Financial Services Ltd, together covering 1,745 people. This plan has been closed to new members since 2004, and no further  rights  have  been  earned  under  it  since December  31,  2019.  All  employees  benefit  from  a defined-contribution  pension  plan  from  January  1, 2020. Underfunding at December 31, 2021 is valued at \u00a339  million  for  the  fund  compartment  dedicated  to the  Automotive  (excluding  AVTOVAZ)  segment  and \u00a39 million for the fund compartment dedicated to RCI Financial Services Ltd.\n\nThis  pension  fund  (a  trust)  is  a  legal  entity.  It  is administered  by  a  board  of  Trustees  with  equal representation for the participating companies and their  current  and  former  employees.  The  fund  is governed  by  local  regulations, which  set the minimum  funding  requirements  that  can  lead  to additional  contributions  being  made  by  the  Group. After  the  last  three-yearly  valuation  in  2018,  the Group  made  a  commitment  to  cover  the  funding shortfall  by  2027  through  payments  amounting  to \u00a35  million  maximum per year. The asset investment policy  is  defined  for  each  section  of  the  fund  by  a supervisory  body  which  examines  the  performance of  investments  quarterly.  The  risks  associated  with these  plans  are  the  usual  risks  (lower  future  returns on  fund  assets,  a  decline  in  the  equities  markets, longer  life  expectancy  for  beneficiaries,  a  rise  in inflation, etc).\n\n## Main changes in the Group's defined-benefit plans\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  an  amount  of  60  million (\u20ac108  million  at  December  31,  2020)  was  reclassified from retirement indemnities to provisions for restructuring, for employees who will benefit from the Collective Contractual Separation plan.\n\nI",

After  seeking  the  opinion  of  legal  advisors,  any provisions deemed necessary are set aside to cover the  estimated  risk.  During  2021,  the  Group  recorded no  provision  in  connection  with  significant  new litigation.  Information  on  contingent  liabilities  is provided in Note 28-A2.\n\nIncreases  to  restructuring  provisions  essentially comprise the effect of workforce adjustment measures in the Europe Region (Note 6-A). In France, restructuring  provisions  have  been  recorded  for\n\nemployee departures expected under the Collective Contractual Separation plan, at the relevant amount net of existing provisions for retirement indemnities.\n\nAt December  31,  2021,  other  provisions  include \u20ac98 million of provisions established in application of environmental regulations (\u20ac91 million at December 31, 2020). These include provisions to cover expenses  relating  to  end-of-life  vehicles  and  used batteries,  and  environmental  compliance  costs  for industrial land in the Europe Region and for industrial sites in the Americas and Eurasia Regions.",

Daimler shares\n\nIn March 2021 the Group sold its entire investment in the Daimler Group, representing 1.54% of the capital, for  the  price  of\u20ac69.50  per  share  or  a  total  of \u20ac1,143  million,  through  a  placement  to  qualified investors. The Group had opted to value the Daimler shares  at  fair  value  via  other  components  of comprehensive  income,  without  the  possibility  of transfer to profit  and  loss  in  the  event  of  sale.  Their fair value was determined by reference to the share\n\nprice  and amounted to \u20ac951 million at December 31, 2020. The gain realized on the sale (compared to the acquisition  price  of  \u20ac35.52  per  share)  amounts  to \u20ac554 million, of which \u20ac187 million are recognized in Other  Components  of  Comprehensive  Income  in 2021. The Nissan Group also sold its investment in the Daimler  Group  during  the  first  half-year  of  2021 (Note 12-D).\n\n## 22-C. Other investments in non-controlled entities\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  other  investments  in  noncontrolled  entities  include  an  amount  of  \u20ac37  million (\u20ac27 million at December 31, 2020) paid to the Funds for  the  Future  of  the  Automobile  (Fonds  Avenir Automobile)  under  the  support  plan  for  automobile\n\nindustry suppliers introduced by the French authorities and automakers. The outstanding amount  payable  by  Renault  Group  at  December  31, 2021 is \u20ac88 million.",

Changes in financial liabilities and sales financing debts\n\n## Changes in participating shares of the Automotive segments\n\nThe participating shares issued in October 1983 and April 1984 by Renault SA are subordinated perpetual shares listed on the Paris Stock Exchange. They earn a  minimum annual return of 9% comprising a 6.75% fixed portion and a variable portion that depends on consolidated  revenues  and  is  calculated  based  on identical Group structure and methods.\n\nParticipating  shares  are  stated  at  amortized  cost, calculated by discounting the forecast interest coupons at the effective interest rate of the borrowing.\n\nThese shares traded for \u20ac442.00 at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac373.65 at December 31, 2020). The financial liability based on the stock market value of the participating shares at December  31,  2021  is \u20ac353  million (\u20ac298 million at December 31, 2020).\n\n## Changes in bonds and other debts of the Automotive segments\n\nUnder  its  EMTN  program,  Renault  SA  issued  a Eurobond  in  April  2021  with  nominal  value  of \u20ac600 million, 7-year maturity and a 2.5% coupon, and another  Eurobond  in  December  2021  with  nominal value  of  \u20ac500  million,  5\u00bd-year  maturity  and  a 2.5% coupon.\n\nAs  parts  of  its  Shelf  Registration  program,  Renault  SA launched a dual-tranche bond on the Japanese market on July 6, 2021 for a total of \u00a5150 billion, consisting of a \u00a540  billion tranche  with  2-year  maturity,  and  a \u00a5110 billion tranche with 3-year maturity.\n\nIn  2021,  Renault  SA  redeemed  bonds  for  a  total  of \u20ac826 million.\n\nIn 2021, the AVTOVAZ group repaid financial liabilities totalling \u20ac93 million.",

        "page_content": "Additional information\n\n## State-guaranteed credit facility of the Automotive segments\n\nIn  2020,  Renault  Group  opened  a  credit  line  with  a pool  of  five  banks,  for  the  maximum  amount  of \u20ac5 billion covered by a French State guarantee for up to  90%  of  the  amount  borrowed.  At  December  31, 2020, \u20ac4 billion had been drawn on this credit line in three  tranches:  \u20ac2  billion  drawn  on  August  5,  2020, \u20ac1  billion  on  September  22,  2020  and  \u20ac1  billion  on December 23, 2020. The remaining \u20ac1 billion credit is no longer available.\n\nThe initial maturity for each drawing was 12 months, extendable  by  Renault  Group  for  a  further  three years,  with  repayment  of  one  third  each  year.  The interest  rate  on  each  drawing  was  indexed  on  the 12-month  Euribor for the first year, then the 6-month Euribor for any extensions. Early repayment after extension is possible for a principal amount of at least \u20ac330 million.\n\nIf  extended, these credit drawings will be repayable in one-third instalments in 2022, 2023 and 2024 on the anniversary  dates  of  the  initial  drawings,  with  early repayment  of  outstanding  instalments  at  Renault Group's initiative at each repayment date.\n\nThe  Group  exercised  the  extension  options  on  all these  drawings  except  for  the  drawing  maturing  in August 2021, of which \u20ac1 billion was repaid.\n\nThe change of intent between December 31, 2020 and June  30,  2021  concerning  \u20ac1  billion  of  the  drawing made  on  August  5,  2020,  was  treated  as  a modification of a financial liability in compliance with IFRS9, paragraph B5.4.6. This led to a decrease in the financial liability with recognition of a corresponding amount of \u20ac23 million in financial income (Note 7).\n\nAn  early  repayment  of  \u20ac340  million  was  made  on 7  February 2022, corresponding to the final instalment (maturing  August  2024)  of  the  first  tranche.  The decision  to  make  this  early  repayment  had  not  been taken at December 31, 2021, and this liability is therefore classified as non-current in the 2021 financial statements. The Group will also announce on 18  February  2022  that  it  intends  to  make  an  early repayment  of  \u20ac1.02  billion  in  2022  (including  the \u20ac340 million mentioned above), starting with the most distant  maturities  (August,  September  and  December 2024).  Reclassifications  between  current  and  noncurrent liabilities,  and  the  impact  of  these  changes on the  net  financial  income,  will  be  recognised  in  2022. Consequently, the entire non-current liability at 31  December 2021 will be reclassified as current during 2022 or at the 2022 year-end.\n\n## Changes in Sales Financing debts\n\nIn 2021, RCI Banque group issued new bonds totalling \u20ac666 million with maturities between 2023 and 2025, and redeemed bonds for a total of \u20ac4,292 million.\n\nFinancial statements\n\nThe  Group  had  access  to  the  TLTRO  III  program (targeted  long-term  refinancing  operations)  set  up by the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\n- \u25cf Three  drawings  were  made  during  2020,  of \u20ac750  million  maturing  in  June  2023,  \u20ac500  million maturing  in  September  2023  and  \u20ac500  million maturing in December 2023, giving a total amount of \u20ac1,750 million maturing in 2023.\n- \u25cf Two  further  drawings  were  made  during  2021,  of \u20ac750  million  maturing  in  September  2024  and \u20ac750 million maturing in December 2024.\n\nThe Group has opted to apply IFRS 9 to its drawings on  the  TLTRO  III  program,  considering  the  interest rate  set  by  the  European  Central  Bank  as  a  market rate since it applies to all banks that benefit from the program, and the European Central Bank decides the rate and can change it unilaterally at any time.\n\nThe initial effective interest rate on TLTRO drawings takes  account  of  the  Group's  achievement  of  loan grant  targets  set  for  the  reference  period  ending  in March  2021.  The  ECB  confirmed  that  these  targets had  been  met  in  September  2021.  For  reasons  of conservatism,  the  group's  estimates  do  not  include achievement  of  loan  grant  targets  in  the  special additional  reference  period.  As  a  result,  the  interest rate  changes  presented  in  ECB  decision  2021/124  of January 29, 2021 have no impact on future estimated cash  flows  relating  to  the  borrowing,  and  do  not therefore  affect  the  accounting  treatment  of  the drawings.\n\nThe interest rate applicable to the period June 2021June 2022 could still be reduced if loan grant targets for the special additional reference period are met. If this  happens,  under  the  current  IFRS  9  rules,  the impact  of  the  interest  rate  reduction  met  would  be recognized  as  an  adjustment  to  the  value  of  the liability in application of paragraph B5.4.6.\n\nRCI  Banque  Group  also  had  access  to  the  Bank  of England's TFSME (Term Funding for SMEs) scheme in 2020,  and  in  2021  made  a  drawing  of  \u00a3409  million maturing in September and October 2025.\n\nThe maximum  interest  rate  applicable  to  this financing  during  2021  was  calculated  as  the  Bank  of England's base rate (0.10% at December 31, 2021) plus a margin of 0.25%. RCI Banque Group could be granted a  more  favourable  rate  if  it  meets  certain  eligibility criteria,  notably  concerning  growth  in  loans  granted over a period ending in June 2021.\n\nRCI  Banque  Group  has  applied  IFRS  9  to  this financing,  considering  this  adjustable  rate  as  a market  rate  because  it  is  applicable  to  all  banks benefiting  from  the  TFSME  scheme.  The  effective interest  rate  has  been  set  at  the  maximum  level  as the  Group  does  not  expect  to  meet  the  loan  grant growth criterion.\n\nI",

At December 31, 2020 these liabilities included a put option  on  minority  interests  in  Coolnagour  Limited which was exercised in 2021.\n\nNo contractual flows are reported for Renault SA and Diac  participating  shares  as  they  have  no  fixed redemption date.",

This is notably the case when the assigned receivables have already been subject to a tax inspection or preliminary audit.  No  assigned  tax  receivables  remained  in  the balance sheet at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe assigned receivables are derecognized when the associated  risks  and  benefits  are  substantially transferred, as described in Note 2-P.\n\nThe  Automotive  segments  assigns  its  dealership receivables to the Sales financing segment. The total dealership  receivables  transferred  to  the  Sales financing  segment  principally  concerns  Renault Group. The amounts are presented in Note 15-D.\n\n## Automotive segments financing by reverse factoring programs\n\nThe  accounting  treatment  for  these  programs  is described in Note 2-P, Assignment of receivables and reverse factoring.\n\nThe Group did not use reverse factoring programs in 2021, and  consequently  there  are  no  financial liabilities  for  reverse  factoring  at  December  31,  2021 (\u20ac26 million at December 31, 2020)\n\n## Note 24\n\n## Financial instruments by category, fair value and impact on net income\n\n## 24-A. Financial instruments by category and fair values by level\n\nIFRS 9 defines three categories of financial instruments:\n\n- \u25cf financial  assets  or  liabilities  at  fair  value  through other components of comprehensive income;\n- \u25cf financial  assets  or  liabilities  at  fair  value  through profit or loss;\n- \u25cf loans and receivables carried at amortized cost.\n\nThe  following  breakdown  by  level  of  fair  value  is presented  for  financial  instruments  carried  in  the balance sheet at fair value:\n\n- \u25cf level  1:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived from quoted prices in an active market; fair value is generally identical to the most recent quoted price;\n- \u25cf level  2:  instruments  whose  fair  values  are  derived from  observable  market  prices  and  are  not included in level 1;\n\nI",

These  financial  assets  remain  at historical  cost.  Other  investments  in  non-controlled entities  also  remain  at  historical  cost,  but  in  an exception to the general approach, if historical cost is  inappropriate  they  are  valued  on  the  basis  of  the share of net equity or using a method based on nonobservable data.\n\nI",

Management of financial risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to the following financial risks:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity risk.\n- \u25cf Market risks (foreign exchange, interest rate, equity and commodity risks).\n- \u25cf Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing.\n\nRisk management differs depending on the operating  segment.  The  risks  described  below concern  the  Automotive  segments,  (considering AVTOVAZ separately in certain cases), and the Sales Financing  segment.  The  Mobility  Services  segment does not have any specific financial  risks  since  it  is financed by the Automotive segments.\n\n## 25-B1. Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group must have sufficient financial resources to finance its automotive and sales financing businesses and  the  investments  necessary  for  their  growth.  To ensure  this  is  the  case,  the  Automotive  and  Sales Financing segments borrow on the capital and banking markets  to  refinance  their  gross  debt  and  guarantee liquidity. This exposes them to liquidity risks if markets are closed for long periods or credit is hard to access. The Automotive and Sales Financing segments are also credit-rated by several agencies. Any downgrading of external  credit  ratings  could  limit  and/or  increase  the cost of their access to the capital markets.\n\n## Liquidity risks - Automotive segments\n\nThe Automotive segments' liquidity risk is managed by the  Financing  and  Treasury  department.  It  is  founded on  an  internal  model  that  defines  the  level  of  the liquidity reserve the Automotive  segments  must maintain to finance their operations and development. The liquidity reserve is closely monitored by a monthly review and reported to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThe  shortage  of  semi-conductors  in  2021  caused general  disruption  to  the  automobile  market,  and  a downturn in the Group's business activity.\n\nRenault SA  handles  most  refinancing  for  the Automotive  segments  through  long-term  resources via  the  capital  markets  (bond  issues  and  private placements),  short-term  financing  such  as  NEU  CP (Negotiable  European  Commercial  Paper),  or  bank financing. Renault SA has several debt programs at December 31, 2021:\n\n- \u25cf An  EMTN  bond  program  with  a  \u20ac10  billion  ceiling. This program has been registered with the AMF.\n- \u25cf A Shelf Registration bond program on the Japanese market with a JP \u00a5200 billion ceiling. This program\n\nhas  been  registered  with  the  Japanese  stock market authorities (Kanto Local Finance Bureau).\n\n- \u25cf A  NEU  CP  program  with  a  \u20ac2.5  billion  ceiling.  This program  has  been  registered  with  the  Bank  of France.\n\nRenault SA and its debt programs are credit-rated by several  agencies.  In  2021,  Renault  SA's  rating  was confirmed by S&P and Moody's (by S&P on March 5 at BB+  with  a  negative  outlook  and  by  Moody's  on September  5  at  Ba2  with  a  negative  outlook).  The Japanese  agency  R&I  also  confirmed  its  rating  of Renault  SA  at  A-  with  a  negative  outlook,  while  the Japanese agency JCR upgraded Renault SA's credit outlook  from  negative  to  stable  on  October  18, keeping its credit rating at A-.\n\nRenault  SA  maintained  its  access  to  the  capital markets in 2021 with the issuance of two Eurobonds and  one  Samurai  bond.  The  two  Eurobonds  were issued  under  the  EMTN  program,  one  in  April  with nominal  value  of  \u20ac600  million  and  7-year  maturity, and  the  other  in  December  with  nominal  value  of \u20ac500 million and 5\u00bd-year maturity. The Samurai bond was  issued  in  early  July  with  nominal  value  of \u00a5150  billion.  It  comprises  one  tranche  of  \u00a540  billion with  2-year  maturity  and  one  tranche  of  \u00a5110  billion with 3-year maturity. Renault SA also maintained its access to short-term financing through use of its NEU CP (Negotiable European Commercial Paper) program.\n\nIn August 2021, Renault SA reimbursed \u20ac1 billion of the \u20ac4  billion  drawn  in  2020  on  the  bank  credit  line guaranteed  by  the  French  government.  This  credit line of an initial \u20ac5 billion was set up in 2020 to cover liquidity  requirements  resulting  from  the  Covid-19 pandemic. It  was  available  until  December  31,  2020, and three drawings totalling \u20ac4 billion were made on it during the second half-year of 2020.\n\nRenault  SA  also  has  confirmed  credit  lines  opened with banks worth \u20ac3,430 million at December 31, 2021 (3,430  million  December  31,  2020).  These  credit  lines mature in more than one year and were undrawn at December  31,  2021  (and  2020).  They  form  a  liquidity reserve for the Automotive segments. The maturities of  the  Automotive  segments'  financial  liabilities  at December 31, 2021 are presented in Note 23-D.\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  Renault  SA's confirmed  credit  arrangements,  bank  loans  and market  financing  does  not  contain  any  clause  that could affect the continued supply of credit as a result of changes in either Renault Group's credit rating or its financial  ratios. Certain  types  of  financing, particularly market  financing,  contain  standard clauses  (pari  passu,  negative  pledge  and  crossdefault clauses).",

        "page_content": "Annual general meeting\n\nAdditional information\n\nAVTOVAZ also uses local bank credit  for  refinancing  , including  a  confirmed  credit  line  maturing  over  one year  with  an  available  amount  of  \u20ac117  million  at December  31, 2021. AVTOVAZ  decides  to  make drawings  on  the  basis  of  cash  forecasts.  The maturities of AVTOVAZ  financial liabilities at December 31, 2021 are presented in Note 23-D. These financial  liabilities  contain  no  covenant  that  would lead  to  accelerated  repayment  if  certain  financial ratios were not respected.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Automotive segments have a  liquidity  reserve  of  \u20ac17.3  billion,  sufficient  to  cover their  commitments  over  a  12-month  horizon.  This reserve  consists  of  \u20ac13.9  billion  of  cash  and  cash equivalents,  and  \u20ac3.4  billion  of  unused  confirmed credit lines (excluding the AVTOVAZ credit line).\n\n## Liquidity risks -Sales Financing segment\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  is  very  attentive  to diversification  of  its  sources  of  liquidity.  In  recent years  Renault  Group  has  widely  diversified  its sources  of  financing,  moving  into  new  distribution zones  in  addition  to  its  longstanding  base  of  Euro bond investors.\n\nRCI  Banque's  liquidity  risk  management  follows  the recommendations of the European Banking Authority.  It  uses  several  indicators  and  analyses (static liquidity, liquidity reserve, several  stress scenarios),  which  are  updated  and  reported  to  RCI Banque's  Financial  Committee  on  a  monthly  basis. The stress scenarios include assumptions concerning  deposit  leakage,  loss  of  access  to  new financing,  partial  unavailability  of  certain  elements of the liquidity reserve and forecasts for issuance of new credit.\n\nThe  alternation  of  different  maturities  and  issue formats  is  part  of  the  Sales  Financing  segment's diversification  strategy  for  financing  sources.  This policy  has  been  followed  for  several  years  and enables the segment to reach the maximum number of investors.\n\nWith  no  growth  in  the  sales  portfolio,  financing requirements  remained  modest  and  RCI  Banque group took a certain number of initiatives to reduce its liquidity reserve, which had reached a record level at  the  end  of  2020.  Given  this  situation,  the  Sales Financing  segment  made  no  bond  issues,  and  took\n\nFinancial statements\n\nsteps to slow down the growth in customer deposits which  nonetheless  increased  by  \u20ac0.5  billion  to \u20ac21.0  billion  at  December  31,  2021,  a  year-on-year increase  of  2.6%  after  the  15%  increase  in  2020. To diversify its financing sources, the Group extended its savings business to the Netherlands in July  2021,  through  the  intermediary  of  the  fintech company Raisin.\n\nIn  preparation  for  the  future,  the  Sales  Financing segment repeated the self-subscribed securitization operation  in  Italy,  raising  it  from  \u20ac1.4  billion  to \u20ac1.8 billion. The  Sales  Financing  segment  also arranged  a  new  private  securitization  program  to refinance  the  residual  value  of  finance  leases  in France.  This  program  is  currently  only  used  for  a symbolic amount, but that amount can be increased, offering  a  potential  new  source  of  secure  financing for  the  Group. During the second half of 2021, a new public  securitization  vehicle  was  set  up  in  the United Kingdom. The \u00a3750 million of self-subscribed senior instruments should be eligible for the Bank of England's  long-term  monetary  policy  and  entitle RCI  Bank  UK  to  access  the  TFSME  (Term  Funding Scheme  for  Small  and  Medium-sized  Enterprises), announced  by  the  Bank  of  England  in  March  2020, and  this  diversify  its  liquidity  reserve.  Finally,  RCI Banque  placed  a  public  automotive  loan-backed securitization in Germany, and issued \u20ac900 million of senior  instruments  (of  which  \u20ac200  million  were self-subscribed).\n\nWith  these  resources,  as  well  as  \u20ac4.3  billion  of undrawn confirmed credit lines with banks, \u20ac3.3 billion of collateral eligible for the Central Banks' monetary  policy  operations,  \u20ac6.6  billion  of  highly liquid  assets (HQLA), RCI Banque is able to maintain its  customer  financing  for  more  than  12  months without access to external liquidities. At December 31, 2021,  RCI  Banque's  liquidity  reserve  (for  the  Europe scope)  amounts  to  \u20ac14.4  billion  (\u20ac16.6  billion  at December  31,  2020).  The  controlled  reduction  of \u20ac(2.2) billion compared to December 31, 2020 lowered the  cost  of  carrying  surplus  cash.  However,  the liquidity reserve was still well above internal targets.\n\nThe  RCI  Banque  group's  issues  and  programs  are credit-rated  by  several  agencies.  In  2021,  S&P downgraded  RCI  Banque's  rating  to  BBB-  with  a stable outlook, while Moody's confirmed its rating of Baa2 with a negative outlook on August 12, 2021.\n\nI\n\n05",

Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe  Group  made  no  major  changes  to  its  foreign exchange risk management policy in 2021.\n\nThe  Group's  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk principally concerns the Automotive segments.\n\n## Foreign exchange risks Automotive segments\n\nIn the Automotive segments, fluctuations in exchange  rates  can  affect  the  following  financial aggregates: operating income (loss), financial income  (expenses),  share  in  net  income  (loss)  of associates  and  joint  ventures,  shareholders'  equity and net cash position.\n\nThe  Performance  and  Control  Department  and  the Financing and Treasury Department are in charge of rolling out and monitoring the Automotive segments' foreign exchange risk management policy.\n\n## Operating income\n\nThe Group  sometimes  hedges  certain  positions. Foreign  exchange  hedges  on  operating  income  and expenses  must  first  be  analysed  by  the  Performance and  Control  Department  and  the  Financing  and Treasury Department, and then require formal authorization  by  Chief  Financial  Officer  or  Chief Executive  Officer,  with  monthly  reporting  of  results  to the  Chief  Finance  Officer.  Wherever  possible,  foreign exchange  operations  are  mainly  undertaken  by  the Group's  trading  room  (Renault  Finance)  for  currencies that are negotiable on the international markets.\n\nThe principal exposure to foreign exchange risks lies in  the  operating  income  (loss).  At  December  31,  2021 based on the 2021 structure of operating results and cash  flows,  a  1%  rise  by  the  euro  against  all  other currencies  would  have  an  unfavourable  impact  of \u20ac20  million  on  the  Automotive  segments'  annual operating income (loss) after any hedging.\n\nIn 2021, to limit the foreign exchange risk exposure of its  operating  margin,  the  Automotive  segments  set up  foreign  exchange  hedges  of  the  pound  sterling, Argentinian peso, Russian rouble, Chinese yuan and Turkish lira.\n\nThe  principal  exposure  in  2021  concerned  the  Russian  rouble,  with  unfavourable  impact  of  approximately \u20ac (16) million in the event of a 1% rise by the euro against the rouble. The 10 largest exposures in absolute value and their sensitivities are presented below in millions of euros:\n\n(\u20ac million)\n\n| Currency         |     | Annual net operating items   | Impact of a 1% rise in the euro   |\n|------------------|-----|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Russian rouble   | RUB | 1,647                        | (16)                              |\n| Polish zloty     | PLN | 667                          | (7)                               |\n| Pound Sterling   | GBP | 658                          | (7)                               |\n| Argentinian peso | ARS | 415                          | (4)                               |\n| Moroccan dirham  | MAD | 394                          | (4)                               |\n| Turkish lira     | TRY | (411)                        | 4                                 |\n| Japanese yen     | JPY | (556)                        | 6                                 |\n| Chinese yuan     | CNY | (687)                        | 7                                 |\n| Romanian leu     | RON | (760)                        | 8                                 |\n| Korean won       | KRW | (926)                        | 9                                 |\n\n## Financial income (expenses)\n\nTo  avoid  any  exchange-related  distortion  of  the  net financial income, it is the Automotive segments' policy to minimize  the  foreign  exchange  risk  affecting financing and investment items in foreign currencies.\n\nAll  the  Automotive  segments'  exposures  to  foreign exchange  risks  on  financial  income  and  expense items are aggregated  and  monitored  by  the Financing  and  Treasury  Department,  with  monthly reporting to the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nIntra-group  financing  flows  in  foreign  currency  are hedged in  the  same  currency.  If  a  subsidiary  needs external financing in a currency other than the local\n\ncurrency, the parent company monitors the operations  closely.  Cash  surpluses  in  countries  that are  not  part  of  the  parent  company's  centralized cash  management  are  generally  invested  in  local currency,  under  the  supervision  of  the  Group's Financing and Treasury Department. The subsidiary Renault  Finance  can  undertake  foreign  exchange operations  on  its  own  behalf,  within  strictly  defined risk limits. Its foreign exchange  positions  are monitored  and  valued  in  real  time.  This  activity  is chiefly intended to maintain the Group's expertise on the financial markets.  It  generates  very  short exposures and does not exceed some tens of millions of euros, so that it cannot have a significant impact on Renault Group's consolidated results.",

On the basis of its contribution to 2021 net income, a 1% rise in  the  euro  against  the  Japanese  yen  would  have increased Nissan's contribution by \u20ac4 million. This  impact  corresponds  only  to  the  impact  of  the euro on the translation of Nissan's contribution to the Renault Group's consolidated statements. It does not reflect  the  inherent  impact  of  euro  fluctuations  on Nissan's  own  accounts,  given  that  Nissan  does varying  levels  of  business  in  the  Euro  zone  and Renault Group has no control over this.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  of  equity investments (in currencies other than the euro) is not generally  hedged.  However,  due  to  its  importance, the investment in Nissan is subject to a partial foreign exchange  hedge  amounting  to  \u00a518,3  billion  at December 31, 2021 (Note 12-G). To limit liquidity risks in yen,  the  Group  has  set  itself  the  rule  of  not  hedging this  net  investment  above  an  amount  equal  to  its best  estimate  of  the  next  three  years'  dividends  in yen to be received from Nissan.\n\n## Net cash position\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  partial  hedge  of  the investment  in  Nissan,  some  of  Renault  Group's  net financial indebtedness  is  denominated  in  yen. At December 31, 2021 a 1% rise in the euro against the yen  would  increase  the  net  cash  position  of  the Automotive  segments  by  \u20ac1.4  million.  This  net  cash position  may  also  be  impacted  by  changes  in exchange  rates  concerning  subsidiaries'  financial assets and liabilities in their local currency.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments' sensitivity to foreign exchange risks\n\nThis  analysis  concerns  the  sensitivity  to  foreign exchange  risks  of  monetary  assets  and  liabilities (including  intra-Group  balances)  and  derivatives denominated in a currency other than the currency of  the  entity  that  holds  them.  However,  it  does  not cover items (hedged  assets  or  liabilities and derivatives)  concerned  by  fair  value  hedging,  for which changes in fair value of the hedged item and the  hedging  instrument  totally  offset  each  other  in the income statement.\n\nThe impact on shareholders' equity (before tax) of a 1%  rise  in  the  euro  against  other  currencies  is assessed  by  converting  financial  assets,  cash  flow hedges  and  the  partial  hedge  of  the  investment  in Nissan.  For  the  Automotive segments,  this  impact would be a favourable \u20ac1 million at December 31, 2021\n\n(\u20ac6  million  at  December  31,  2020),  explained  by  the yen  bond  issues  that  make  up  the  partial  hedge  of the investment in Nissan (see Note 12-G).\n\nThe  impact  on  net  income  of  a  1%  rise  in  the  euro against  other  currencies  would  be  an  unfavourable impact of \u20ac2 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac14 million at December  31,  2020),  mainly  attributable  to  unhedged operating  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  a currency that is not the functional currency of the entity that holds them.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe  Sales  Financing  segment  has  low  exposure  to foreign  exchange  risks  due  to  the  management principles applied. No position can be taken under the central  management  framework  for  refinancing;  the trading  room  hedges  all  flows  concerned.  Residual, temporal positions in foreign currencies related to the time  differences  in  cash  flows  inherent  to  multicurrency cash management may still remain. They are monitored daily  and  the  same  hedging  policy  applies. The Sales Financing subsidiaries are obliged to obtain refinancing in their own currency and as a result are not exposed.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  limits  are assigned to subsidiaries where sales financing activities or refinancing take place in several different currencies,  and  to  subsidiaries  authorized  to  invest some of their  cash  surpluses  in  a  currency  other  than their local currency.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 RCI Banque group's consolidated foreign exchange position reached \u20ac4.2 million.\n\n## 25-B3. Interest rate risks\n\nThe Group made no major changes to its interest rate risk management policy in 2021.\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rate risk principally concerns the Sales Financing segment.\n\n## Interest rate risk - Automotive segments\n\nThe  Automotive  segments'  net  financial  income  is exposed to a risk of variations in market interest rates affecting  its  cash  surpluses  and  financial  liabilities, and to a lesser degree its shareholders' equity.\n\nThe interest rate risk management policy applies the following principles:\n\n- \u25cf Liquidity  reserves  are  generally  established  using floating-rate financing. The Automotive segments' available cash is managed centrally by Renault SA as far as possible and invested in short-term bank deposits by Renault Finance.\n- \u25cf \u00b7Long-term investments by the Automotive segments generally use fixed-rate financing, except  for  AVTOVAZ's  financing  from  local  banks which uses essentially floating-rate.\n\nI",

In  2021, AVTOVAZ did not set  up  any  hedging  instruments for  its  financial  liabilities.  The  finance  department of AVTOVAZ closely monitors interest rate movements  in  Russia,  and  if  rates  rise  it  will contemplate  the  possibility  of  taking  steps  to reduce the impact on the net financial income, by increasing  the  proportion  of  fixed-rate  debt  as  it refinances its portfolio.\n\nThe ratio of liquidity reserve hedging by floating-rate debts  is  monitored  monthly.  Interest  rate  hedging instruments for the Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ) segment  are  standard  interest  swaps  that  are adequately  covered  by  hedged  liabilities,  such  that no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nThe financing in yen undertaken as part of the partial hedge of the investment in Nissan equity is fixed-rate.\n\nFinally,  Renault  Finance  carries  out  interest  rate transactions on its own behalf, within strictly defined risk limits, and positions are monitored and valued in real  time.  The  risk  associated  with  this  arbitrage activity is very limited, and has no significant impact on the Group's consolidated net income.\n\n## Interest rate risk - Sales Financing segment\n\nThe overall interest rate risk represents the impact of fluctuating rates on the future gross financial margin. RCI  Banque's  operating  results  may  be  affected  by movements in market interest rates or interest rates applicable to customer deposits. The Sales Financing segment's aim is to limit these risks as far as possible in order to protect its margin on sales.\n\nTo  take  account  of  the  difficulty  of  precisely matching  the  structure  of  borrowings  with  the structure  of  loans,  a  limited  amount  of  flexibility  is allowed  in  each  subsidiary's  interest  rate  hedging. This  flexibility  is  reflected  in  a  sensitivity  limit assigned  to  each  subsidiary  and  validated  by  the finance  committee,  in  an  individual  adaptation  of part  of  the  limit  Renault  Group  assigns  to  the  Sales Financing segment.\n\n- A daily sensitivity calculation by currency, management  entity,  and  asset  portfolio  is  used  to ensure that each entity respects its assigned limits. All RCI Banque entities use the same method for this assessment  of interest rate sensitivity, which measures the impact of a 100 base point increase in interest rates on the value of balance sheet items for each  entity.  Sensitivity  is  calculated  daily  for  each currency  and  each  management  entity  (central refinancing office, French and foreign sales financing  subsidiaries)  for  the  purpose  of  overall management  of  interest  rate  risks  across  the consolidated scope of the Sales Financing segment.\n\nEach  entity's  position  with  regard  to  its  limit  is checked daily, and immediate hedging directives are issued  to  the  subsidiaries  if  circumstances  require. The results of the checks are reported monthly to the Sales Financing  segment's  Finance  Committee, which  checks  that  the  positions  comply  with  the Group's  financial  strategy  and  current  procedural instructions.\n\n## Analysis of the Sales Financing segment's structural interest rate risk shows the following:\n\n- \u25cf Virtually  all  loans  to  customers  by  Sales  Financing subsidiaries bear interest at a fixed rate and have terms  from  one  to  seventy-two  months.  These loans are hedged by fixed-rate resources with the same  structure.  They  are  covered  by  macrohedging and only generate a residual interest rate risk.  In  subsidiaries  where  the  financing  bears interest  at  a  floating  rate,  the  interest  rate  risk  is hedged  by  macro-hedging  using  interest  rate swaps.\n- \u25cf The main activity of the Sales Financing segment's central  refinancing  department  is  refinancing  the segment's  sales  subsidiaries.  The  outstanding credit  issued  by  Sales  Financing  subsidiaries  is backed by fixed-interest resources, some of which are micro-hedged by interest rate swaps, and floating-rate resources. Macro-hedging transactions  in  the  form  of  interest  rate  swaps keep  the  sensitivity  of  the  refinancing  holding company  below  the  limit  set  by  the  Group  (\u20ac32 million). These macro-hedging transactions concern  floating-rate  resources  and/or  fixed-rate resources converted to floating-rate resources by micro-hedging of swaps.\n\n## Analysis of Group financial instruments' sensitivity to interest rate risks\n\nThe  Automotive  and  Sales  Financing  segments  are exposed to the following interest rate risks:\n\n- \u25cf variations  in  the  interest  flows  on  floating-rate financial  instruments  stated  at  amortized  cost (including fixed-rate instruments swapped  to floating rate, and structured products);\n- \u25cf variations  in  the  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  financial instruments stated at fair value;\n- \u25cf variations in the fair value of derivatives.\n\nImpacts are estimated by applying a 100 base point rise  in  interest  rates  over  a  one-year  period  to financial instruments reported in the closing statement of financial position.",

All other impacts affect net income.\n\nCalculation of the individual segments' sensitivity to interest  rates  includes  intersegment  loans  and borrowings.\n\nFor  the  Automotive  segments,  the  impact  on  net income  of  a  100  base  point  rise  in  interest  rates applied to financial instruments exposed to interest rate  risks  would  be  a  favorable  \u20ac109.8  million. Shareholders' equity would be unaffected.\n\nFor the Sales Financing segment,  the  overall sensitivity  to  interest  rate  risks  in  2021  remained below  the  limit  set  by  the  RCI  Banque  group (\u20ac70  million  at  December  31,  2021).  At  December  31, 2021, a 100 base point rise in interest rates would have the following impacts on net income and shareholders' equity (before taxes):\n\n- \u25cf +\u20ac0.8 million for items denominated in Korean won;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac0.3  million  for  items  denominated  in  Swiss francs;\n- \u25cf +\u20ac0.3  million  for  items  denominated  in  pounds sterling;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(1.7) million for items denominated in Polish zloty;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(0.9) million for items denominated in euros;\n- \u25cf \u20ac(0.8) million for items denominated in Brazilian real.\n\nThe sum of the absolute sensitivities in each currency amounts to \u20ac8.6 million.\n\n## Fixed rate/floating rate breakdown of the Group's financial assets, after the effect of derivatives\n\n|                                                          | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021      | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020      | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                                              | Total               | Auto excluding AVTOVAZ | AVTOVAZ             | Mobility services   | Sales Financing     | Total               | Auto excluding AVTOVAZ | AVTOVAZ             | Mobility services   | Sales Financing     |\n| Financial assets before hedging: fixed rate (a)          | 1,072               | 128                    | -                   | -                   | 944                 | 1,468               | 525                    | -                   | -                   | 943                 |\n| Financial assets before hedging: floating  rate (a')     | 22,300              | 13,732                 | 398                 | 12                  | 8,158               | 21,273              | 11,962                 | 558                 | 15                  | 8,738               |\n| Financial assets before hedging                          | 23,372              | 13,860                 | 398                 | 12                  | 9,102               | 22,741              | 12,487                 | 558                 | 15                  | 9,681               |\n| Hedges: floating rate / fixed (b)                        | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Hedges: fixed rate / floating (b')                       | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Hedges                                                   | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                      | -                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Financial assets after hedging: fixed rate  (a+b-b')     | 1,072               | 128                    | -                   | -                   | 944                 | 1,468               | 525                    | -                   | -                   | 943                 |\n| Financial assets after hedging:  floating rate (a'+b'-b) | 22,300              | 13,732                 | 398                 | 12                  | 8,158               | 21,273              | 11,962                 | 558                 | 15                  | 8,738               |\n| Financial assets after hedging                           | 23,372              | 13,860                 | 398                 | 12                  | 9,102               | 22,741              | 12,487                 | 558                 | 15                  | 9,681               |\n\nI",

Equity risk\n\nIn March 2021, the Group sold all its shares in Daimler. Consequently  its  exposure  to  equity  risks  has  been marginal since that date.\n\n## 25-B5. Commodity risk\n\n## Management of commodity risk\n\nCommodity  purchase  prices  can  change  suddenly and significantly, and cannot necessarily be passed on through vehicle sale prices. This may lead Renault Group's  Purchases  department  to  hedge  part  of  its commodity risks using financial instruments. These  hedges  are  subject  to  volume,  duration  and price limits.\n\nIn 2021 Renault Group undertook hedging operations on base metals and precious metals, within the limits validated by of Renault SA.\n\nThe operations in progress at December 31, 2021 are classified  for  accounting  purposes  as  cash  flow hedges,  and  accordingly  changes  in  their  fair  value are included in other components of comprehensive income to  the  extent  of  the  effective  portion  of  the hedges.\n\n## Analysis of financial instruments' sensitivity to commodity risks\n\nFinancial instruments' accounting  sensitivity to commodity  risks  results  from  derivatives  used  to hedge the Group's economic exposure to these risks.\n\nA  10%  increase  in  commodity  prices  for  derivatives designated  as  hedging  derivatives  would  have  a positive  impact of \u20ac59 million on other components of comprehensive income at December 31, 2021.\n\n## 25-B6. Bank counterparty risk and credit risk on customer and dealer financing\n\n## Customer credit risk on Automotive receivables\n\nThe Automotive (excluding ATOVAZ) segment's exposure  to  credit  risk  is  limited  because  of  the assignment  of  many  receivables  leading  to  their deconsolidation,  and  systematic  hedging  of  risks  on export  receivables.  Non-assigned  sales  receivables and  receivables  covered  by  guarantee  are  regularly monitored.\n\nAVTOVAZ trades only with recognized, creditworthy third  parties.  All  future  customers  requiring  credit facilities are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis, and as a result, the AVTOVAZ Group's exposure  to  bad  debts  is  not  significant.  The maximum exposure is the carrying amount. There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the AVTOVAZ Group.\n\n## Credit risk on customers, dealers and commitments given by the Sales Financing segment\n\nThe Sales Financing segment is exposed to customer and  dealer  credit  risk  when  risk  management techniques  are  insufficient  for  protection  against default on payment by its counterparties.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of losses due to the incapacity of RCI  Banque  customers  to  fulfill  the  terms  of  a contract  signed  with  the  bank.  Credit  risk  is  closely linked  to  macro-economic  factors  including  the unemployment  rate,  corporate  bankruptcies,  debt servicing costs, revenue growth, disposable household  income,  dealership  profitability  and  the price of used vehicles. It has a significant impact on the Sales Financing segment's business.",

It  also  uses an  internal  rating  system  to  evaluate  lending  to dealers. Although RCI Banque is constantly adjusting its acceptance  policy  in response  to market conditions,  any  increase  in  the  credit  risk  would increase  its  cost  of  risk  and  its  provisions  for  bad debt. RCI Banque has detailed procedures to recover receivables  that  are  compromised  or  in  default, arranging repossessions and sales of unpaid vehicles.  However,  there  can  be  no  guarantee  that the  policies  of  issuing  credit,  monitoring  credit  risk, payment  recovery  action,  and  repossession  of vehicles  are,  or  will  be,  sufficient  to  avoid  an unfavourable  impact  on  its  financial  results  and position.\n\nAn increase in the credit risk would increase the cost of  risk  and  provisions  for  bad  debt,  with  a  direct impact on RCI's financial results and potentially on its internal capital.\n\n## Bank counterparty risk\n\nDue  to  its  operations  on  the  financial  markets  to invest  cash  surpluses,  manage  foreign  exchange risks and interest risks, and manage payment flows, the Group is exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nThis bank counterparty risk affecting Group entities is managed  by  both  the  Automotive  and  Sales Financing segment in a fully-coordinated approach.\n\nIt  is  founded  on  an  internal  rating  system  based mainly  on  counterparties'  long-term  credit  ratings and equity. This system is used by all Renault Group companies exposed to a bank counterparty risk.\n\nGroup  companies  which,  due  to  the  nature  of  their business, are significantly exposed  to  a  bank counterparty risk are monitored daily to ensure that they  comply  with  authorized  counterparty  limits,  in accordance  with  specific  procedures.  The  Group produces a consolidated monthly report covering all its  bank  counterparties,  organized  by  credit  rating. This report provides a detailed analysis of compliance with limits in terms of amount, maturity and type, as well as a list of the main exposures.\n\nTo reduce the bank counterparty risk, most deposits are  contracted  with  large  network  banks  and generally  have  terms  shorter  than  90  days,  as  this allows  a  good  spread  of  the  risk.  In  the  event  of volatile macroeconomic situations that may arise in emergent  countries  and  potentially  affect  their banking  systems,  the  Group  introduces  an  action plan  to  step  up  counterparty  risk  monitoring,  and makes  adjustments  to  the  counterparty  limits  if necessary.  The  exposure  on  each  banking  group  is assessed monthly on a consolidated basis, with the Automotive and Sales Financing entities. The Group is not subject to any significant risk concentration for its operations on the financial and banking markets.\n\nNo losses due to default by a bank counterparty were recorded  in  2021.  The  bank  counterparty  risk  borne by the Group through its shares in investment funds (UCITS)  is  incorporated  into  the  risk  of  changes  in value  for  those  products,  and  monitored  using specific rules.\n\nI\n\n05",

Transactions with the French State and public companies\n\nIn the course of its business Renault Group undertakes transactions with the French State and public companies  such  as  UGAP,  EDF,  and  La  Poste.  These transactions,  which  take  place  under  normal  market conditions, represent sales of \u20ac280 million in 2021 (\u20ac259 million in 2020), an automotive receivable of \u20ac58 million, a  sales  financing  receivable  of  \u20ac272  million  and  a\n\nfinancing  commitment  of  \u20ac14  million  at  December  31, 2021 (respectively \u20ac72 million, \u20ac282 million and \u20ac40 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nIn  2020  Renault  Group  benefited  from  a  Stateguaranteed credit facility, issued by a pool of banks as described in Note 23-C.\n\n## 27-D. Transactions with unconsolidated controlled entities\n\nA  certain  number  of  controlled  entities  are  not consolidated, as explained in Note 2-C, because their contribution to the consolidated financial statements is considered non-significant (Note 17).\n\nThe only company  with  sales  of  more  than \u20ac100  million  and/or  a  balance  sheet  value  of  more than \u20ac100 million is Renault Nissan Global Management,  which  manages  Renault  Group  and Nissan expatriates.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Renault  Group's  expenses  with  this company  amounted  to  approximately  \u20ac120  million (\u20ac185 million in 2020).\n\nIn Renault Group's financial position at December 31, 2021,  the  balances  of  transactions  between  Renault Nissan  Global  Management  and  Renault  Group consist mainly of operating receivables amounting to \u20ac80  million  (\u20ac116  million  at  December  31,  2020)  and operating payables amounting  to \u20ac45 million (\u20ac61 million at December 31, 2020).\n\n## Note 28\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments, contingent assets and liabilities, assets pledged and received as collateral\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  business,  Renault  enters  into  a certain  number  of  commitments,  and  is  involved  in litigations or subject to investigations by competition and automobile regulation authorities. Any liabilities resulting  from  these  situations  (e.g.  pensions  and other  employee  benefits,  litigation  costs,  etc.)  are\n\ncovered by provisions. Details of other commitments that constitute off-balance sheet commitments and contingent liabilities are provided below (Note 28-A).\n\nRenault also receives commitments from customers (deposits,  mortgages,  etc.)  and  may  benefit  from credit lines with credit institutions (Note 28-B).",

Contingent liabilities\n\nGroup  companies  are  periodically  subject  to  tax inspections  in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate. Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are recognized on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the risk that the proceedings or appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful. Tax  liabilities  are  recognized  via  provisions  when there  are  uncertainties  over  the  determination  of taxes.\n\nOn  December  19,  2019  Renault  s.a.s..  received provisional  notification  of  a  tax  reassessment  on transfer prices in 2016, and an additional notification was received on June 24, 2021 concerning the years 2017 and 2018. Renault Group is challenging the most significant amounts of these provisional notifications,  and  no  provision  has  been  recognised in  the  financial  statements  at  December  31,  2021  in connection with this matter.\n\nRESA  (Renault  Espa\u00f1a  SA)  was  notified  of  a \u20ac213 million tax reassessment for transfer prices at December  31, 2020, which Renault Group is contesting.  A  procedure  for  amicable  settlement between  France  and  Spain  was  begun  in  2021.\n\nNo  provision  has  been  recognized  in  connection with this notification, since Renault Group considers that  it  has  good  chances  of  winning  its  case.  A deposit of \u20ac135 million was paid to the Spanish tax authorities  in  December  2020,  recognized  in  noncurrent financial assets and presented in cash flows from investing activities (under Decrease (Increase) in loans  of  the  Automotive  segments)  in  the consolidated cash flow statement. Another payment  of  \u20ac78  million  was  made  in  2021  and recognized in the same way.\n\nRenault Samsung Motors, based in South Korea, was subject  to  a  tax  reassessment  for  the  period 2007-2011 concerning the amount of royalties paid to Renault  s.a.s..  This  reassessment  was  challenged, and paid after a settlement was reached in 2017, but there is still a risk of reassessments for 2012 and later years.  In  2016,  Renault  Group  applied  for  an  APA ('Advance  Pricing  Agreement')  which  is  still  in discussion  between  the  Korean  and  French  tax authorities. No  provision has been  recognized in  connection  with  this  matter  between  2012  and December 31, 2021, since the amount of the potential reassessments cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nI",

At December 31, 2021, the Group has not identified any significant risk in connection with these operations.\n\nGroup  companies  are  periodically  subject  to investigations by the authorities in the countries in which  they  operate.  When  the  resulting  financial consequences are accepted, they are recognized in the  financial  statements  via  provisions.  When  they are  contested,  they  are  recognized  on  a  case-bycase  basis,  based  on  estimates  that  take  into account  the  risk  that  the  proceedings  or  appeals undertaken may be unsuccessful.\n\nThe  main  investigations  by  the  competition  and automotive  regulations  authorities  in  progress  at December 31, 2021  concern  illegal  agreements  and the level of vehicle emissions in Europe.\n\nOn January 9, 2019 the Italian Competition Authority (Autorit\u00e0 Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato' - AGCM) fined RCI Banque \u20ac125 million, with Renault SA jointly liable for payment of the fine. The Group is contesting  the  grounds  for  this  fine  and  has appealed  against  the  decision.  Renault  considers that the probability of the decision being cancelled or fundamentally amended by a court order is high. Due to the large number of variables affecting the amount  of  the  fine,  if  upheld,  it  is  impossible  to reliably estimate the amount that could be payable at  the  end  of  the  proceedings.  On  April  3,  2019  the Group's application for suspension of the payment was  accepted,  with  arrangement  of  a  bank guarantee. On October 21, 2020 the court cancelled the  AGCM's  decision  in  its  entirety,  and  the  AGCM filed an appeal against that ruling on December 23, 2020.  The  bank  guarantee  arranged  in  2019  has been  cancelled.  No  provision  was  recognized  in connection  with  this  matter  in  2021  or  2020. On  3  February  2022,  the  Italian  Council  of  State rejected  the  appeal  by  the  AGCM  and  upheld  the administrative  court  ruling  that  had  cancelled  the AGCM's  decision.  This  decision  by  the  Council  of State is final.\n\nIn the ongoing 'emissions' affair in France, in which a formal legal investigation was opened on January 12, 2017 at the request of the Paris public prosecution office,  Renault  s.a.s.  was  officially  placed  under investigation for deceit on June 8, 2021.\n\nIn  July  2021  Renault  Group  paid  bail  of  \u20ac20  million (included  in  the  balance  sheet)  to  guarantee  its representation  throughout  the  proceedings  and  to cover  payment  of  any  damages  and  fines.  It  also issued a \u20ac60 million bank guarantee on October 8,\n\n2021  to  cover  compensation  for  any  prejudice identified. Renault Group denies having committed any  offence.  All  Renault  Group  vehicles  are,  and always  have  been,  type-approved  in  accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  the  next  steps  in these  ongoing  proceedings  cannot  be  reliably estimated  at  this  stage,  and  no  provision  was recognized  in  connection  with  this  matter  at December 31, 2021 (or at December 31, 2020).\n\nApproximately 70% of the Group's sales are subject to CO2  emission  regulations,  principally  in  the European  Union  but  also  especially  in  China, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and South Korea.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the three members of the Alliance Renault,  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  signed  agreements  to  pool  their  CAFE  (Corporate Average  Fuel  Economy)  targets  for  the  European Union  and  the  United  Kingdom.  The  potential noncompliance penalties payable to the authorities concerned are determined at the level of the group formed by the Alliance's three automakers. Renault did  not  recognize  any  provision  in  connection  with this matter at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n\nRenault  Group  confirmed  in  a  press  release  of January 4, 2021 that it had achieved its CAFE targets for passenger  vehicles  and  light  commercial vehicles  in  2020,  subject  to  validation  by  the European Commission in the following months. The validation  process  was  still  ongoing  at  the  date  of publication of these financial statements.\n\nRenault  also  confirmed  in  a  press  release  of January  17,  2022  that  it  had  achieved  its  CAFE targets for passenger vehicles and light commercial vehicles  in  2021  (these  results  are  due  to  be consolidated  and  officialized  by  the  European Commission in the next few months).\n\nA  provision  of  \u20ac11  million  was  recognized  for  CAFE penalties  payable  for  2021  in  South  Korea,  raising the  total  provision  for  the  years  2019  to  2021  to \u20ac35 million.\n\nGroup companies are also subject to the applicable regulations  regarding  pollution,  notably  of  soil  and ground water. These regulations vary depending on the  country  of  location.  Some  of  the  associated environmental liabilities  are  potential  and  will  only be  recognized  in  the  accounts  if  the  activity  is discontinued or the site closed. It is also sometimes difficult  to  determine  the  amount  of  the  obligation reliably. Provisions are only established for liabilities that correspond to a legal or constructive obligation at the closing date, and can be estimated with reasonable reliability.",

Share purchase commitments given\n\nWhen  the  Group  grants  put  options  to  minority shareholders to sell their investments in fully consolidated  companies,  a  liability  corresponding  to the option is recognized, with a reduction in shareholders' equity - non-controlling interests' share.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  put  options  granted  by  the Group  to  minority  shareholders  concern  Banco  RCI Brasil, Rombo  Compania  Financiera, and RCI Colombia  S.A.  The  consequences  for  the  financial statements are explained in Note 18-H.\n\nPartnership  agreements  were  signed  in  2018  with Oyak  in  Turkey,  including  perfectly  symmetrical  put and  call  options  for  non-controlling  investments, entitling Renault s.a.s., subject to certain conditions, to purchase Oyak's shares in Oyak Renault (call) and to sell its shares in MAIS (put), and entitling Oyak to sell its shares  in  Oyak  Renault  (put)  and  purchase  Renault s.a.s.'s shares in MAIS (call). The exercise price for the put  option,  if  exercised,  will  be  determined  by  three independent experts who would be appointed at the exercise  date.  Analysis  of  the  contracts  did  not identify  any  circumstances  beyond  the  control  of\n\nRenault  Group  that  could  lead  to  Oyak's  put  option exercised without Renault Group being able to object. Consequently,  no  liability  is  recognized  at  December 31, 2021 in connection with these options.\n\n## 28-A4. Assets pledged as guarantees for management of the liquidity reserve\n\nFor  management  of  its  liquidity  reserve,  the  Sales Financing  segment  has  provided  guarantees  to  the Banque  de  France  (under  France's  central  collateral management  system  3G  -  Gestion  Globale  des Garanties)  in  the  form  of  assets  with  book  value  of \u20ac7,111  million  at  December  31,  2021  (\u20ac7,465  million  at December 31, 2020). These assets comprise \u20ac6,628  million  of  shares  in  securitization  vehicles, \u20ac3  million  of  Eurobonds  and  \u20ac480  million  of  sales financing  receivables  (\u20ac6,675  million  of  shares  in securitization vehicles, \u20ac104 million of euro bonds and \u20ac686  million of sales financing receivables at December  31,  2020).  The  financing  provided  by  the Banque de France against these guarantees amounts to \u20ac3,738 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac2,250 million at December 31, 2020).

Statutory auditors' report on the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Renault,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the accompanying financial statements of Renault for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Risks Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence  requirements  of  rules  required  by provided  in  the  French  Commercial  Code  (code  de  commerce)  and  the  French  Code  of  ethics  (code  de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st ,  2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their  operations  and  their  financing,  and  have  led  to  greater  uncertainties  on  their  future  prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nI\n\n05",

Investments are valued at acquisition cost at the date of entry, and their recoverable value is then assessed by management as described in Note 2.1 to the notes to the individual financial statements of Renault.\n\nWith respect to Renault's investments in fully controlled compnies, Renault has opted for the equity method. The value of these investments is determined based on their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault, and the  change  in  the  overall  share  of  shareholders'  equity  corresponding  to  these  interests  is  recorded  in shareholders' equity under 'Equity valuation difference'.\n\nThe other investments mainly relate to Renault's equity investment in Nissan. This investment is valued at the lower amount between the book value and the value in use, which takes into account the share of net assets and profitability  prospects  of  Nissan.  The  assessment  of  the  recoverable  value  of  Renault's  investment  in  Nissan requires judgement from management.\n\nIn this context, we have considered that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nIn  order  to  assess  the  reasonableness of the value in use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purpose of the consolidated financial statement audit. Our work mainly consisted in:\n\nRegarding Renault's investments in controlled companies:\n\n- \u25cf Check  that  the  shareholders'  equity  in  each  of  these  investments  corresponds  to  their  contribution  to  the consolidated equity of Renault.\n- \u25cf Check that Renault has performed the necessary adjustments, if any, to take into account potential impairment losses accounted for in the group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Regarding Renault's investment in Nissan:\n\n- \u25cf Assess  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  assumptions  used  by  Renault  in  the  impairment  test  performed  to assess the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by referring to Nissan's stock market value, mid-term plan and historical performance and the growth prospects of the Automotive sector.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-6 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Report on corporate governance\n\nWe  attest  that  the  Board  of  Directors  report  on  corporate  governance  sets  out  the  information  required  by Articles L.225-37-4, L22-10-10 and L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce).\n\nConcerning  the  information  given  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Article  L.22-10-9  of  the  French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or awarded to the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified the consistency with the financial statements,  or  with  the  underlying  information  used  to  prepare  these  financial  statements  and,  where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlled companies included in the scope of consolidation. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.",

Based  on  these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn  accordance  with  French  law,  we  have  verified  that  the  required  information  concerning  the  purchase  of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights and the cross-shareholdingshas been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe  have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional  standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the procedures performed by the statutory  auditor  relating  to  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial  statements presented  in  the  European  single  electronic  format,  that  the  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG SA and on June 19, 2020 for MAZARS.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  KPMG  SA  was  in  the  eighth  year  of  total  uninterrupted  engagement  and MAZARS in the second year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with  French  accounting  principles  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Risks  Committee  is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  financial  reporting  process  and  the effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risks  management  systems  and  where  applicable,  its  internal  audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nI",

The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u25cf Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u25cf Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u25cf Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant  doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25cf Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Risks Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Risks Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies  in  internal  control  regarding  the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  that  we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risks Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risks Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risks Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis La D\u00e9fense, February 25, 2022 The statutory auditors French original signed by\n\nKPMG Audit A department of KPMG S.A.

We are not required to give our opinion, as to whether they are beneficial  or  appropriate  or  to  ascertain  the  existence  of  other  agreements.  It  is  your  responsibility,  in accordance with Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the relevance of these agreements prior to their approval.\n\nWe  are  also  required,  where  applicable,  to  inform  you  in  accordance  with  Article  R.  225-31  of  the  French Commercial  Code  (Code  de  commerce)  of  the  continuation  of  the  implementation,  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021, of the agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe performed those procedures which we deemed necessary in compliance with professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this type of engagement. These procedures consisted in verifying the consistency of the information provided to us with the relevant source documents.\n\n## Agreements submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting\n\nWe  hereby  inform  you  that  we  have  not  been  notified  of  any  agreements  authorized  during  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval in accordance with Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting\n\nIn accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been notified that the implementation of the following agreements, which were approved by the Annual General Meeting in prior years, continued during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## With the French State, shareholder of your Company\n\n## Persons concerned\n\nMr Thomas Courbe and Mr Martin Vial, Board members of your Company representing the French State.\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nOn December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the conclusion of a 'Governance Agreement' between Renault and the French State which aims to regulate the exercise of voting rights attached to the Renault shares held by the French State.\n\n## Conditions\n\nPursuant to the authorization granted by your Board of Directors, on February 4, 2016 and by your Annual General Meeting in April 29, 2016, your Company has signed concurrently with the French State a Governance Agreement under which the voting rights attached to the French State's shares exceeding a certain percentage of Renault's total exercisable rights (set at 17.9% in the event of a 'usual' quorum, or at 20% in the event of a particularly high quorum) are, in certain cases, exercised in a neutral manner, that is to say in such a way that they do not affect the adoption or rejection of the resolutions concerned by the limitation. The written agreement also describes the conditions for implementing these restrictions with the registrar of Renault.\n\nThe restriction to the free exercise of voting rights of the French State notably applies to all decisions which fall within  the  authority  of  the  Ordinary  Annual  General  Meeting,  except  for  decisions  concerning  (i)  dividend distributions,  (ii)  the  appointment,  renewal  or  removal  from  office  of  Board  members  representing  the  French State, (iii) the disposal of significant Company's assets, (iv) related-party agreements that are not approved by the representatives of the French State and (v) buybacks of shares from identified shareholders.\n\nI\n\n05",

This  amendment  was submitted to the approval of your general meeting of April 30, 2013.\n\nIn its meeting of December 11, 2015, your Board of Directors authorized the signature of a governance agreement between  your  Company  and  Nissan  Motor  Co.

The  amendment  modifies  the  'Restated Alliance Master Agreement' without altering its term, which remains indefinite. It has been applicable since it was entered into. This agreement has been approved by the Annual General Meeting of April 29, 2016.\n\n5",

Notes to the financial statements\n\nThe following disclosures constitute the notes to the balance sheet at December  31, 2021, before appropriation of net profit for the year, which shows total  assets  of  \u20ac34,400  million  and  to  the  income statement for the year then ended, which shows net profit of \u20ac538 million.\n\nThe  financial  statements  cover  the  twelve-month period from January 1, to December 31, 2021.\n\nThe financial statements for 2021 were approved for issue  by  the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  of  Renault S.A. on 17 February 2022.\n\nThese  financial  statements  are  included  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  of  Renault  S.A. (Renault Group).\n\n## 5.2.4.2.1. Significant events\n\nFollowing  its  approval  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on January  14,  2021,  Luca  de  Meo,  CEO  of  the  Renault Group, presented 'Renaulution', a new strategic plan which  aims  to  shift  the  Renault  Group's  strategy from  the  pursuit  of  volume  to  the  creation  of  value, through 3 phases launched in parallel:\n\n- \u25cf The  'Resurrection'  phase,  running  until  2023,  will focus on margin recovery and cash generation.\n- \u25cf The  'Renovation'  phase',  running  until  2025,  will bring  renewal  and  enrichment  to  the  ranges, contributing to brand profitability.\n\n- \u25cf The 'Revolution' phase, which will start in 2025, will switch  the  Group's  business  model  to  technology, energy  and  mobility,  making  the  Renault  Group  a frontrunner in the value chain of new mobilities.\n\nNissan's exercise ended on 31 March 2021 with a net loss of -\u20ac3 398 million (-Y448,7 billion) and Renault SA received no dividend from Nissan during 2021.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic that appeared in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and continued throughout the year 2020, the global automotive market suffered a  year-on-year  downturn  of  14.2%  between  2019  and 2020. To protect its employees, and in compliance with the  measures  introduced  by  national  governments, the Group suspended its commercial and production activities in most countries during March 2020. During the  lockdown  periods,  practically  all  employees  not working  in  production  and  sales  worked  from  home, and  furlough  measures  were  put  in  place  in  2020. Production and sales resumed mainly from May 2020, respecting  the  end-of-lockdown  measures  imposed by the governments of the countries where the Group has operations. A second lockdown and curfews were imposed in several countries, including France, during the second half of 2020 and France also introduced a third  lockdown  and  curfews;  all  these  measures  also had negative effects on the Group's business activity in  2020  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic,  which  were  less  serious  but  continued  in 2021,  business  also  began  to  be  affected  during  the first  half-year  of  2021  by  disruption  to  supplies  of electronic  components  in  the  worldwide  automotive sector. This disruption  grew  during  the  second half-year, with the principal consequence of losses of",

The \u20ac1 billion undrawn at December 31, 2021 ceased to be available at that date, and \u20ac1 billion of the August 2020  \u20ac2  billion  drawing  was  repaid  in  August  2021 (note  23-C).  The  Group  also  issued  a  new  bond  in November 2020 with nominal value of \u20ac1 billion, and several  bonds  in  2021  (a  \u20ac600  million  bond  in  April 2021,  a  \u20ac1.2  billion  Samurai  bond  in  July  2021  and  a \u20ac500 million bond in November 2021). The Group also generated  a  significant  positive  free  cash  flow  in 2021. At the date of publication of these consolidated financial  statements,  the  Group  has  sufficient  cash and  sources  of  financing  to  ensure  continuity  of operations  for  the  next  twelve  months,  and  has demonstrated its capacity to issue debt.\n\nOn March 10, 2021 Renault SA sold its entire involvement in Daimler A.G., i.e. 16,448,378 shares representing 1.54% of Daimler's capital. The sale price was \u20ac1,143 million, or \u20ac69.5  per  share.  The  proceeds  of  the  sale  enabled Renault SA to accelerate its debt reduction.  Settlement and delivery of the shares took place on March 16, 2021. This  sale  does  not  impact  the  industrial  partnership between the Renault Group and Daimler.\n\nIn  May  2021,  Nissan  sold  its  1.54%  involvement  in Daimler.\n\nIn  November 2021, Daimler announced that it had sold its  entire involvement in Renault SA, i.e. 9,167,391 shares representing 3.1% of the capital and 5% of voting rights.\n\nAt the General Shareholders' Meeting of April 23, 2021, it was decided not to distribute a dividend for 2020.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.2. Accounting policies\n\nRenault  S.A.  has  drawn  up  its  annual  financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with French laws and regulations, as set out  in  regulation  2014-3  of  the  ANC  (Autorit\u00e9  des Normes Comptables) concerning the French chart of accounts, amended by later regulations.\n\nThe  accounting  conventions  have  been  applied sincerely,  in  compliance  with  the  conservatism principle and the basic concepts of:\n\n- \u25cf the going concern principle,\n- \u25cf consistency of methods,\n- \u25cf accruals-basis accounting, and applying the general  rules  for  preparation  and  presentation  of annual financial statements.\n\nThe basic method used to value items recorded in the accounting records is the historical cost method.\n\n## A. Investments\n\nAs allowed by CNC (Conseil National de la Comptabilit\u00e9) notice N\u00b034 (July 1988), as an alternative to the standard valuation method for investments carried in the balance sheet,  Renault  S.A.  has  opted  to  state  investments  in wholly-controlled companies at equity:\n\n- \u25cf this method is applied to all companies that are fully consolidated in the Group's financial statements;\n- \u25cf the  shareholders'  equity  of  these  companies  is determined  under  the  accounting  policies  applied in the consolidated financial statements; as this is a valuation  method,  intercompany  eliminations  are not taken into account;\n- \u25cf in  valuing  a  subsidiary,  its  holdings  in  companies wholly  controlled  by  the  Group  are  valued  in  the same way;\n- \u25cf the change  during the year in the overall percentage of shareholders' equity corresponding to these interests is not an income or loss item; it is included  in  shareholders'  equity  under  'Equity valuation  difference'.  This  amount  cannot  be distributed  or  used  to  offset  losses.  When  it  is negative,  a  provision  for  general  depreciation  is established as a charge against income.\n\nInvestments  in  companies  not  wholly  controlled  by Renault  S.A.  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost,  less related expenses, or at their book value if this is lower. The  book  value  takes  account  of  the  share  of  net assets  and  profitability  prospects.  Provisions  are established when the book value of the investments is lower than the gross value.\n\nLoans granted and receivables relating to subsidiaries and affiliates are recorded at historical cost.  Impairment  is  recognized  when  there  is  a  risk that these advances will not be recovered.\n\nI",

Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are valued at acquisition cost, excluding related expenses and accrued interest for bonds, or at market value if this is lower.\n\nTreasury  shares  held  for  the  purposes  of  free  share plans and stock option plans are included in marketable securities.  These  shares  are  covered  by  a provision for expenses, corresponding to the difference between the value of the shares (acquisition price or net book value at the date of reallocation) and the exercise price  of  the  options  for  beneficiaries,  when  that exercise price is lower than the acquisition cost.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to a specific plan are also included in marketable securities. Impairment is recorded  if  the  stock  market  price  falls  below  the book value.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  securities  is  determined  mainly  by reference to market prices.\n\n## C. Receivables\n\nReceivables are stated at nominal value. Impairment is recognizsed when their realizable value falls below historical cost, notably based on age and the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## D. Translation  of  foreign  currency  receivables  and liabilities\n\nReceivables  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies are translated as follows:\n\n- \u25cf all  receivables  and  liabilities  in  foreign  currencies are converted at the year-end exchange rate;\n- \u25cf exchange differences arising between the date of transactions  and  December  31  are  recorded  in Other  assets  and  Deferred  income  (translation adjustment);\n- \u25cf a  provision  for  risk  equal  to  the  unrealised  exchange losses  is  established  after  determining  an  overall foreign exchange position for each currency (including derivatives).\n\nUnrealized  losses  affecting  Nissan  hedge  are  no longer covered by provisions in the income statement. Under regulation ANC  2015-05, no provisions are recorded in the income statement for unrealized losses on the hedging instrument until the hedged cash flows are realized (date of liquidation or sale of the investment).\n\n## E. Participating shares\n\nParticipating shares are recorded in a separate line of  shareholders'  equity  at  nominal  value  with  no subsequent revaluation.\n\n## F. Loans and financial debts\n\nLoans  are  stated  at  their  nominal  amount.  Loan costs, including issuance expenses, and  bond\n\nredemption  premiums,  which  are  recorded  in  Other Assets,  are  amortised  on  a  straight-line  basis  over the corresponding duration.\n\n## G. Provisions for risks and liabilities\n\nProvisions  for  risks  and  liabilities  are  defined  in accordance  with  ANC  regulation  2014-03.  They  are established for probable payment obligations existing  at  the  year-end.  A  contingent  liability,  in contrast, is an obligation that is neither probable nor definite  at  the  date  the  financial  statements  are established, or a probable obligation that cannot be reliably estimated. Provisions are not established for contingent  liabilities, but an  off-balance  sheet commitment is reported where relevant.\n\n## H. Derivates\n\nChanges in the value of hedging derivatives are not recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  unless  partial  or total  recognition  of  such  changes  is  relevant  to ensure symmetrical treatment to the hedged item .\n\nThis symmetrical treatment would involve revaluation of the hedging instrument in a transition account, with a  corresponding entry in a Cash Instrument account, in  parallel  to  the  translation  adjustments  booked  on the hedged item.\n\nForeign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  loans  set  up for the Nissan hedge have no longer been included in profit and  loss  since  the  application  of  ANC regulation  2015-05  form  January  1,  2017.  They  are recorded in specific accounts under other receivables  or  other  liabilities  and  the  accumulated amounts will be transferred to the income statement at the date of liquidation or sale of the investment.\n\nThe  value  of  derivatives  in  an  'Isolated  Open Position' is adjusted to market value in the balance sheet at each year-end, via an entry to the translation adjustment account. If the market value indicates an unrealized loss, an equivalent provision is recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe positive or negative difference between the spot price  and  the  forward  price  of  the  hedge  is  spread over the duration of the hedge in the financial result.\n\n## Assumptions and methods used\n\nUnrealised  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses correspond to the difference between the spot price and the year-end price.\n\n## I. Net extraordinary items\n\nExceptional  items  are  revenues  and  expenses resulting from events or transactions that are clearly distinct from the company's  normal  business operations,  and  are  not  expected  to  recur  on  a frequent or regular basis.",

There is no other financial expenses in 2021.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.6. Extraordinary items\n\nIn  March  2021,  Renault  SA  sold  its  involvement  in Daimler  A  G  for  a  sum  of  1,143  million  euros.  The disposal  of  the  shares,  with  a  historical  value  of 584 million euros, resulted in an exceptional profit of 558 million euros.\n\nIn 2020 Renault SA's net exceptional items corresponded  to  a  loss  of  -\u20ac406  million,  mainly resulting  from  derecognition  of  the  shares  in  DRAC (-\u20ac282 million), offset by reversal of the impairment on the  shares  booked  in  financial  income,  and  the balancing payment of \u20ac122 million paid to Dongfeng in connection  with  the  share  transfer.  The  operation generated a loss of \u20ac155 million, which was recognized in the financial statements at December 31, 2020.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.7. Income tax\n\nAs Renault S.A. elected to determine French income taxes  under  the  domestic  tax  consolidation  regime when it  was  formed,  this  regime  has  applied  to  the group in which Renault S.A. is taxed in France since January  1,  2004.  French  subsidiaries  that  are  more than  95%  owned  by  Renault  S.A.  pay  their  income\n\ntaxes  directly  to  the  company  under  this  regime. Each entity included in the domestic tax consolidation records its theoretical taxes as if it was taxed  separately.  The  tax  saving  generated  by  this system  is  treated  as  income  for  Renault  S.A.,  the company  heading  the  group  of  entities  concerned. The  Renault  tax  group,  applying  the  principle  of neutrality, Renault S.A. is not obliged to reallocate or reimburse  the  subsidiaries  for  the  tax  savings resulting from utilization of their tax losses.\n\nThe  maximum  allowable  amount  of  losses  carried forward against taxable income is \u20ac1 million plus 50% of the taxable income above that amount. The balance can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nThese rules are applicable:\n\n- \u25cf for determining the income/loss of the tax consolidation group;\n- \u25cf by  convention,  for  determining  the  income/loss  of each  company  included  in  the  tax  consolidation serving as a base for their calculation of income tax.\n\nThese  rules  on  tax  loss  carryforwards  apply  to  all losses existing at the year-end, whatever their origin.\n\nIn practice, Renault S.A. has not charged deficits for the determination of the 2021 taxable income of the group which amounts to -\u20ac1,598 million.\n\nIn 2021, the tax consolation group waived the reduced rate  on  industrial  royalties  as  permitted  by  article 39 terdecies of the CGI.\n\nThe income generated by income taxes in 2021 was \u20ac148 million, corresponding to the income tax paid by the  subsidiaries  of  Renault  S.A.,  including  any  tax adjustments, as if they were taxed separately.\n\nDetails of the tax charge related to the year are as follows:\n\nTaxes\n\nNet income\n\n|                                        | Pre- tax   |             |         |                  |            |          |                 |           |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|-------------|---------|------------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|\n| (in Euro million)                      | income     | Theoretical | Netting | Credit generated | Tax credit | Net  tax | due Theoretical | As booked |\n| Current income subject  to normal rate | -143       | -183        | 183     |                  |            | 0        | 40              | -143      |\n| Extraordinary item                     | 558        | 159         | -159    |                  |            | 0        | 399             | 558       |\n| Tax consolidation                      |            | -148        |         |                  |            | -148     |                 | 148       |\n| Impairment                             |            | 25          |         |                  |            | 25       |                 | -25       |\n| Other                                  |            |             |         |                  |            |          |                 |           |\n| Total                                  | 415        | -147        | 24      |                  |            | -123     | 439             | 538       |",

Loss of the  benefit  of  stock  options  or  performance  shares follows  the  applicable  regulations:  all  options  and\n\nrights  are  forfeited  in  the  event  of  resignation  or termination and a decision is made for each individual case  when  an  employee  leaves  at  the  Company's instigation.\n\nNew  performance  share  plans  were  introduced  in 2021, concerning 1 605 thousand shares. The vesting period for rights to shares is 3 years, with no minimum holding  period  and  without  distinction  between residents and non-residents.\n\n## A.

Performance share plans\n\nFor plans 24 to 25, vesting and minimum holding periods are  different  depending  on  whether  beneficiaries  are French tax residents or tax residents of other countries, in order to take account of local tax constraints.\n\nThe vesting period for shares awarded to French tax residents is three years followed by a holding period of one year.\n\nFor  non-French  tax  residents,  the  vesting  period  is four years and there is no minimum holding period\n\nAs from plan 26, the vesting period is 3 years with no holding period for French or foreign tax residents.",

Renault  S.A.  also  undertakes  forward exchange operations to hedge loans and borrowings in foreign currencies with its subsidiaries.\n\n## Interest rate risk:\n\nRenault S.A. carries most of the Group's indebtedness. Its interest rate risk management policy applies two basic principles: long-term investments use fixed-rate financing,  and  investments  for  liquidity  reserves  use floating-rate financing. The financing in yen undertaken as part of the hedge of Nissan equity is fixed-rate.\n\nRenault  S.A.  uses  derivatives  to  implement  the  above interest rate and exchange risk management policies. These operations are undertaken with Renault Finance, a fully-owned Renault Group subsidiary.\n\n## Liquidity risk:\n\nThe  Group's  automotive  operating  segment  needs sufficient  financial  resources  to  finance  its  day-to-\n\nday  business  and  the  investments  necessary  for future  growth.  It  therefore  regularly  borrows  on  the banking  and  capital  markets  to  refinance  its  debt, and this  exposes  it  to  a  liquidity  risk  in  the  event  of market  closure  or  tensions  over  credit  availability. As  part  of  its  centralised  cash  management  policy, Renault  S.A.  handles  most  refinancing  for  the automotive  operating  segment  via  the  capital markets  through  long-term  resources  (bond  issues, private  placements)  and  short-term  financing  such as treasury notes, or by bank financing.\n\nRenault  S.A.  also  has  confirmed  credit  agreements with banking establishments (see note II.6.2).\n\nThe  contractual  documentation  for  these  financing arrangements  and  credit  agreements  contains  no clause that might adversely affect credit availability as  a  result  of  a  change  in  Renault's  credit  rating  or financial ratio compliance.\n\nGiven  the  available  cash  reserves,  confirmed  credit lines  unused  at  the  year-end,  and  the  prospects  for renewal  of  short-term  financing,  Renault  S.A.  has sufficient financial resources to cover its commitments over a 12-month horizon.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.20. Commitments given and received\n\nOff-balance-sheet commitments are as follows:\n\n|                            | 2021               | 2021               | 2020   | 2020               |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|--------------------|\n|                            | Concerning related | Concerning related |        | Concerning related |\n| (in Euro million)          | Total              | companies          | Total  | companies          |\n| Commitments received       |                    |                    |        |                    |\n| Guarantees and depositss   |                    |                    |        |                    |\n| unused credit lines        | 3,430              |                    | 3,430  |                    |\n| TOTAL                      | 3,430              |                    | 3,430  |                    |\n| Commitments given          |                    |                    |        |                    |\n| Guarantees and deposits    | 705                | 700                | 830    | 700                |\n| unused opened credit lines | 446                | 446                | 484    | 484                |\n| TOTAL                      | 1,151              | 1,146              | 1,314  | 1,184              |\n\nAs  part  of  the  management  of  RCI  Banque's  major risk ratio, Renault  S.A.  entered  into  a  pledging agreement  in  2010  for  a  deposit  of  \u20ac700  million  by Renault S.A. with RCI Banque.\n\nThere  are  no  restrictive  clauses  on  credit  lines opened but unused.\n\n## Contingent liabilisties\n\nGroup  companies  are  periodically  subject  to  tax inspections  in  the  countries  in  which  they  operate. Accepted tax adjustments are recorded as provisions in the financial statements. Contested tax adjustments are  recognized  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  taking  into account  the  risk  that  the  proceedings  or  appeals undertaken  may  be  unsuccessful.  Tax  liabilities  are recognized via provisions when there are uncertainties over the determination of taxes.\n\nOn  30  December  2021,  Renault  SA  received  a provisional  notification  of  a  tax  reassessment  in respect of transfer pricing for the years 2013 to 2016. The  most  significant  amounts  of  these  provisional notifications are disputed  and  have  not  been provided for in the accounts at December 31, 2021.\n\nRenault s.a.s  had  received  a  provisional  notification of  a  tax  reassessment in respect of transfer pricing for the 2016 financial year on 19 December 2019, which was  supplemented  by  a  notification  dated  24  June 2021  in  respect  of  the  2017  and  2018  financial  years. The  most  significant  amounts  of  these  provisional notifications are disputed  and  have  not  been provided for in the accounts at December 31, 2021.\n\nGroup companies are periodically subject to investigations  by  the  authorities  in  the  countries  in which  they  operate.

It  also issued  a  \u20ac60  million  bank  guarantee  on  October  8, 2021  to  cover  compensation  for  any  prejudice identified.  Renault  Group  denies  having  committed any  offence.  All  Renault  Group  vehicles  are,  and always  have  been,  type-approved  in  accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  the  next  steps  in these  ongoing  proceedings  cannot  be  reliably\n\n## Other information\n\n## 5.2.4.2.21.

Workforce\n\nRenault S.A. has no employees.\n\n## 5.2.4.2.23. Directors' fees and compensation of corporate officers\n\nThe  net  amount  of  Directors'  fees  to  be  paid  to directors  amounts  to  \u20ac929,086  in  respect  of  2021 (\u20ac763,374 paid for 2020). The Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive attendance fees for his term as director.\n\nCompensation  excluding  social  security  charges recognized in the income statement in 2021, including the provisional variable portion, amounts to \u20ac4 million.\n\n75,000 performance shares were awarded to corporate officers in 2021.\n\nestimated  at  this  stage,  and  no  provision  was recognized  in connection  with  this matter  at December 31, 2021 (or at December 31, 2020).\n\nOn  January  9,  2019  the  Italian  Competition  Authority (Autorit\u00e0  Garante  della  Concorrenza  e  del  Mercato'  AGCM) fined RCI Banque \u20ac125 million, with Renault SA jointly  liable  for  payment  of  the  fine.  The  Group  is contesting the grounds for this fine and has appealed against  the  decision.  Renault  considers  that  the probability of the decision being cancelled or fundamentally amended by a court order is high. Due to the large number of variables affecting the amount of the fine, if upheld, it is impossible to reliably estimate the amount  that  could  be  payable  at  the  end  of  the proceedings. On April 3, 2019 the Group's application for suspension  of  the  payment  was  accepted,  with arrangement of a bank guarantee. On October 21, 2020 the court cancelled the AGCM's decision in its entirety, and  the  AGCM  filed  an  appeal  against  that  ruling  on December  23,  2020.  The  bank  guarantee  arranged  in 2019 has been cancelled. No provision was recognized in connection with this matter in 2021 or 2020.\n\nOn  3  February  2022,  the  Italian  Council  of  State rejected  the  AGCM  appeal,  and  confirming  the decision  of  the  Administrative  Court  which  had annulled  AGCM''s  decision.  This  decision  of  the Council of State is final.",

        "page_content": "Information about the company, the capital and the share ownership\n\n## 6.1.2.2. Annual General Meetings\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  convened  in  accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions. The right to  attend  Annual General Meetings is evidenced by the registration  of  the  shares  in  an  account  in  the  name  of the  shareholder  or  in  the  name  of  the  registered intermediary  acting  on  his  or  her  behalf,  by  midnight (zero hours) Paris time on the second working day before the  Annual  General  Meeting,  either  in  the  registered share  account  held  by  the  Company  or  in  the  bearer share  accounts  held  by  an  authorized  intermediary. The  registration  of  bearer  shares  in  the  share  records held  by  the  authorized  intermediary  is  evidenced  by  a shareholding certificate issued by the said intermediary.\n\n## 6.1.2.3. Shares and voting rights\n\nShares are registered in an account according to the provisions and terms established by law. Fully paidup shares are in either registered or bearer form, at the  discretion  of  their  owner.  However,  shares  that are not fully paid-up must be in registered form.\n\nEach  shareholder  has  as  many  votes  as  he  or  she owns shares, subject to the provisions below.\n\nSince April 3, 2016, pursuant to Article L. 225-123 of the French  Commercial  Code,  as  amended  by  Law  No. 2014-384  of  March  29,  2014  (the  so-called  Florange Law),  unless  provided  otherwise  in  the  Renault articles  of  association  adopted  subsequently  to  the promulgation  of  the  Florange  Law,  a  voting  right double to that conferred to other shares is automatically attributed to all fully paid up shares for which  proof  of  registration  is  provided  for  at  least two years in the name of the same shareholder.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, 108,310,457 Renault shares held double  voting  rights,  representing  around  36.6%  of the  share  capital  and  around  69.7%  of  the  voting rights  that  may  be  exercised  in  Renault's  Annual General Meeting at that date.\n\nThe double voting right automatically ceases for any share that has been converted to a bearer share or undergone  a  transfer  of  ownership,  subject  to  any exceptions provided for by law.\n\nFree  shares  resulting  from  the  capital  increase, earnings  or  other  paid-in  capital  are  entitled  to double  voting  rights  from  their  date  of  issue  if  they are attributed on account of shares already enjoying such rights.\n\nIn addition, treasury shares do not carry voting rights. At  December  31,  2021,  the  theoretical  number  of voting rights was 398,856,642.\n\nIn  view  of  the  4,582,464  Treasury  shares  and  the 44,358,343  shares  held  by  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd. (see chapter 5.2.6.1 below), all of which are deprived of voting rights, the total number of exercisable voting rights at December 31, 2021, was 305,557,492.\n\n## 6.1.2.4. Identifiable bearer shares\n\nThe  Company  is  authorized  to  make  use  of  the appropriate legal provisions for identifying shareholders  having  immediate  or  future  voting rights in its own Shareholders' Meetings.\n\n## 6.1.2.5. Shareholding disclosures\n\nIn addition to the legal requirement for shareholders to inform the Company  if  they  hold  certain percentages  of  its  share  capital  or  voting  rights, every  shareholder  or  fund  management  company that  comes  into  possession  of  a  number  of  shares above 2% of the  share  capital  or  voting  rights,  or  a multiple of this percentage representing less than or equal to 5% of the share capital or voting rights, shall inform  the  Company  of  the  total  number  of  shares held.  Such  disclosure  shall  be  made  by  registered letter  with  return-receipt  within  a  time  period  set forth  in  a  Conseil  d'\u00c9tat  decree,  starting  from  the date  of  registration  of  the  shares  that  brought  the shareholder's interest up to or beyond the threshold. In  excess  of  5%,  the  aforementioned  disclosure requirement  applies  to  1%  fractions  of  the  share capital or voting rights.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  determining  the  thresholds described  above,  indirectly  held  shares  or  equity equivalents  held  as  defined  by  the  provisions  of Articles L. 233-7 and  L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code will also be taken into account.\n\nThe  declarer  must  certify  that  the  said  declaration includes  all  shares  held  or  owned  as  per  the provisions  of  the  preceding  paragraph,  and  must indicate  the  acquisition  date(s).  The  disclosure requirement  applies  in  the  same  manner  if  the holding of shares falls below any of the aforementioned thresholds, 2% or 1% as applicable.\n\nIf  the  conditions  described  above  are  not  complied with,  any  shares  exceeding  the  fraction  that  should have  been  declared  shall  be  deprived  of  its  voting rights at any Shareholders' Meetings held in a period of two years following the date of due notification, in so  far  as  this  is  requested  at  the  meeting  by  one  or more shareholders who together hold at least 1% of share capital.\n\n## Threshold crossings in 2021\n\nIn  2021,  the  Company  received  declarations  for  the crossing  of  the  legal  threshold  of  5%  of  the  voting rights,  alternately  upwards  and  downwards,  from The Capital Group Companies, Inc., acting on behalf of  clients  and  funds  under  its  management.  The Capital  Group  Companies'  most  recent  notification, dated  September  2,  2021,  indicated  that  it  held 5.003% of the Company's share capital and 3.71% of its voting rights.\n\nI\n\nCorporate\n\ngovernance\n\n06",

and\n- v. more  broadly,  perform  all  other  transactions currently admissible, or that would  become authorized  or  admissible,  by  applicable  laws  or regulatory provisions or by the AMF.\n\nThe  acquisition,  disposal,  transfer  or  exchange  of these  shares  may  be  performed  by  any  means, notably  on  the  market  or  through  over-the-counter transactions, including block trading, using derivative financial  instruments  or  bonds  or  securities  granting access  to  the  Company's  share  capital,  or  by implementing option strategies, within the bounds of applicable regulations.\n\n## The Annual General Meeting sets:\n\n- \u25cf the maximum purchase price (or the counter-value of  this  amount  on  the  same  date  in  any  other currency),  excluding  acquisition  costs,  at  \u20ac100  per share, and the maximum amount of funds allocated for the completion of the share purchase program at  \u20ac2,957.25  million,  it  being  specified  that  in  the event  of  transactions  affecting  the  share  capital (splitting  or  consolidation  of  shares  or  free  share allocations  to  shareholders),  the  price  and  the maximum  amount  of  funds  allocated  for  the completion of the share purchase program will be adjusted on the basis of the ratio of the number of securities constituting the share capital prior to the transaction compared with the total number after the transaction;\n- \u25cf the  number  of  shares  which  may  be  acquired  at 10% of the shares constituting the share capital, it being specified that (a) this limit applies to a given amount  of  the  Company's  share  capital,  to  be adjusted if necessary to take into account transactions affecting the share capital subsequent  to  this  Annual  General  Meeting  and (b)  if  the  aim  of  the  share  buyback  is  to  enhance share liquidity pursuant to the conditions set out in the AMF General Regulations, the number of shares taken  into  account  to  calculate  the  10%  limit corresponds  to  the  number  of  shares  purchased, minus  the  number  of  shares  resold  during  the authorization period.\n\nWithin the limits allowed by the applicable regulations, transactions performed by the Board of Directors  pursuant  to  this  authorization  may  take place  at  any  time  during  the  validity  of  the  share buyback program, it being specified that if  a  public bid for the Company's stocks is made by a third party, the  Board  of  Directors  may  not  implement  this authorization and the Company may not pursue any share purchase program until after the end of the bid period,  except  in  the  case  of  prior  authorization\n\nI",

At December 31, 2021, this was distributed as follows:\n\n- \u25cf the  French  State  held  15.01%  of  the  share  capital corresponding to 22.26% of theoretical voting rights and 29.05% of exercisable voting rights in Renault (excluding the application of the restrictions described  in  chapter  6.2.6.2  of  the  Universal registration document);\n- \u25cf the Nissan group, through its wholly-owned subsidiary  Nissan  Finance  Co.,  Ltd.,  held  15%  of Renault's share capital (unchanged compared with December  31,  2020).  However,  Nissan  Finance  Co., Ltd.  is  not  entitled  to  exercise  the  voting  rights attached to these shares pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of the French Commercial Code, owing  to  Renault's  ownership  interest  in  Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., parent company of Nissan Finance Co., Ltd. ;\n\n- \u25cf Renault's  employees  and  former  employees  own 3.61% of the share capital, including 2.89% via FCPE mutual  funds  under  collective  management  and 0.72%  by  employee  beneficiaries  of  free  share allocations since the 2016 plan;\n- \u25cf treasury  stock  represented  1.55%  of  the  share capital. Under French law, such shares do not carry voting rights;\n- \u25cf the  free  float  represented  64.83%  of  the  share capital  (compared  with  61.88%  at  December  31, 2020); and\n- \u25cf the members of the Board of Directors together and directly hold less than 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, aside from The  Capital  Group  Companies,  Inc.  (5.06%),  no  other shareholder  holds  more  than  5%  of  the  capital  or voting rights, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert, other than the French State or Nissan Finance Co, Ltd.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nA\n\nAlliance: Renault,  Nissan,  and  Mitsubishi  Motors  are part  of  the  Alliance  (legal  structure  described  in chapter 1.2 of this document)\n\nAVES: Alliance  Vehicle  Evaluation  System:  a  system of quality checks conducted on new vehicles as they come off the assembly lines. AVES applies a detailed method comprising a static/visual component and a dynamic component to detect defects.\n\nAVTOVAZ: Russian  company,  manufacturer  of  the LADA  brand  in  which  Renault  has  a  controlling interest,  via  a  joint  venture,  fully  consolidated  in Renault's financial statements since the end of 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB\n\nBOM: Board of Management, which is responsible for the  company's  strategic  guidance  and  decisions. Replaces the CEG in name since January 2021.\n\nC\n\nCAFE: Corporate  Average  Fuel  Economy,  which represents the average level of fuel consumption or CO2  emissions  for  all  passenger  vehicles  sold  by  a carmaker.\n\nCCT: Cross-Company  Team,  a  team  comprised  of Renault  and  Nissan  representatives  who,  as  part  of the Alliance, explore synergy possibilities for the two companies.\n\nCMF: Common Module Family, a sharing principle, via a series of shared platforms of the Alliance, based on a modular system of architecture that enables a wide range  of  vehicles  to  be  built  from  a  smaller  pool  of parts,  creating  higher  added  value  for  the  Group's customers.\n\nCVT: Continuously Variable Transmission. A gearbox technology  that  enables  the  vehicle  to  run  at optimum power. A CVT delivers better fuel economy than  a  conventional  automatic  transmission.  It provides  a  smoother,  more  comfortable  driving experience  by  shifting  seamlessly  through  gear ratios with no break in acceleration.\n\nD\n\nDownsizing: reduction  of  engine  capacity.  Optimizing combustion-powered engines remains one of the most economical ways of limiting fuel consumption and, as such, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Downsizing involves  reducing  the  capacity  of  the  engines  -  and thus  fuel  consumption  and  CO2  emissions  -  while maintaining performance.\n\nE\n\nEBA: Emergency Brake Assist. A system that detects emergency  braking  situations  and  instantaneously increases  braking  pressure  to  shorten  the  distance the vehicle takes to stop.\n\nElectriCity: Renault  Group  created  in  2021  ' Renault ElectriCity ',  an  industrial  hub  in  the  north  of  France (manufacturers in in Douai, Maubeuge and Ruitz) that has the Group's largest electric vehicle manufacturing capacity in the world.\n\nEquity: The  Group  manages  the  capital  of  the Automotive  segment  excluding  AVTOVAZ  using  a ratio  equal  to  the  net  debt  of  the  Automotive segment excluding AVTOVAZ divided by the amount of equity. The net financial indebtedness includes all non-operating  interest-bearing  financial  liabilities and  commitments  less  cash  and  cash  equivalents and  other  non-operating  financial  assets  such  as marketable securities or the segment's loans. Equity is the  amount  shown  in  the  Group's  financial statement.\n\nEuro NCAP: safety standards for crash tests.\n\nEuro NCAP  conducts  crash  tests to provide consumers with accurate information on the safety performances  of  their  cars.  Since  2009,  Euro  NCAP has  given  an  overall  rating  to  each  vehicle  tested with  assessments  of  'Adult  occupant  protection', 'Child protection', 'Pedestrian  protection'  and 'Safety  assist'.  Euro  NCAP  publishes  information about  ESC  fitment  and  the  results  of  rear  impact (whiplash) tests in terms of seat design.\n\nEuro 5 and Euro 6: the Euro 5 emission standards are part  of  the  Euro  emission  standards,  which  set  the maximum  pollutant  emission  limits,  excluding  CO2, for  cars  and  other  vehicles.  The  Euro  5  emission standard  came  into  effect  in  September  2009  for new car certifications and covers all new cars since January 2011. In 2014, Euro 6, which focuses mainly on NOx emissions, took its place.\n\nF\n\nFC: fuel  cell.  Consisting  of  a  nucleus  and  a  single electron, hydrogen is the simplest and lightest of the elements. It  is  14  times  lighter  than  air.  In  a  fuel  cell, hydrogen  and  oxygen  are  brought  into  contact  on either side of a polymer electrolyte membrane. They combine to produce water, the only 'emission' of the engine, which generates electricity and heat. It is this electrical  energy  that  powers  the  vehicle's  electric engine.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by a company  after  interest  payments,  tax  and  net investments. FCF is used to:\n\n- \u25cf reduce the Net Financial Debt of Automotive;\n- \u25cf pay dividends;\n- \u25cf buy  back  the  company's  own  shares  and  minority interests;\n- \u25cf carry  out  external  growth  operations:  acquire companies or holdings in associated companies.\n\nThe  FCF  indicator  for  the  automotive  sectors is  an indicator defined and calculated based on accounting  data  in  the  cash  flow  statement. However,  this  indicator  is  neither  defined  nor required in IFRS.\n\nThe Group has chosen to calculate this indicator on the basis of the Automotive segments, excluding all items  from  the  sales  financing  segment,  with  the exception of dividends paid and capital increases in sales financing.\n\nFree cash flow is therefore obtained from the items in the  statement  of  cash  flows  of  the  automotive sectors by adding the following items:\n\nCash flow (excluding dividends received from listed companies  and  including  dividends  received  from sales finance)\n\n- + change in the working capital requirement\n- + physical and  intangible investments  net  of disposals\n- +  change  in  capitalized  leased  assets  (vehicles  and batteries)\n- - subscription to Sales Financing capital increases\n- = operational  free  cash  flow  of  the  automotive sectors\n\nFTT: Functional  Task  Team:  a  team  made  up  of Renault  and  Nissan  representatives  who,  within  the framework  of  the  Alliance,  provide  their  respective expertise on management processes, standards and tools.\n\n## G\n\nGEC: The Group's Executive Committee is responsible  for  the  company's  strategic  guidance and  decisions.  Renamed  Board  of  Management (BoM) since January 2021.\n\n## H\n\nHSE: Renault created an HSE division (Health, Safety, Environment)  on  September  1,  2016.  Its  task  is  to converge  policies  on  working  conditions,  health, safety and the environment. The mission of this new entity  is  to  ensure  the  Group's  HSE  governance  by defining,  in  collaboration  with  the  business  lines concerned, an overall policy and ambitious progress objectives concerning safety and working conditions,  ergonomics,  industrial  hygiene  and  the environment.\n\nHYVIA :  In  June  2021,  Renault  Group  and  Plug  Power signed  an  agreement  to  create  a  joint  venture dedicated to hydrogen mobility. The company HYVIA will offer a complete ecosystem of turnkey solutions, including  light  commercial  vehicles  with  fuel  cells, and charging stations.\n\n## K\n\nKPI: Key  Performance  Indicators.  KPIs  are  used  to measure the Company's performance. They provide an  overview  of  the  Group's  performance,  which  is reported monthly to the GEC. KPIs are the main tool for performance management in each geographical region or business line.\n\n## L\n\nLAB: the accident  analysis,  biomechanics  and human  behavior  laboratory  known  as  the  desire  to improve  road  safety,  drawing  on  a  number  of scientific  disciplines  where  physics  and  human sciences  converge.  Accident  analysis  and  research into driver behavior probe the causes and consequences  of  road  accidents  with  a  view  to improving  prevention.  Biomechanics  endeavors  to increase protection for vehicle occupants.\n\n## M\n\nMateriality  matrix: the  materiality  matrix  is  a  tool which enables prioritization of extra-financial stakes with  strategic  reach.  By  conducting  a  materiality analysis,  the  Company  works  on  the  subjects  that have a (potentially) extensive and significant impact on  its  business  model,  and  then  translate  these  (as far  as  possible)  into  indicators.  The  methodology used  must  be  comprehensible,  reproducible  and transparent.\n\n## N\n\nNEDC: The  New  European  Driving  Cycle  is  a standardized driving cycle and test procedure used to measure the emission levels and fuel economy of all  types  of  vehicles  in  Europe.  The  NEDC  is  thus  an objective criterion for assessing the performance of models by different manufacturers. The vehicle is put on a roller bench and driven three times through the same  urban  cycle  (ECE-15),  followed  by  one  'extraurban'  cycle.  The  average  of  the  four  cycles  is  the average fuel economy.\n\n## O\n\nOpen Innovation Lab: the creation of Open Innovation  Labs  is  part  of  the  Renault-Nissan Alliance's  innovation  culture  and  strategy:  they enable  innovation  opportunities  to  be  cultivated based  on  an  open  ecosystem  comprising  start-ups, universities and investors and a local economy such as  local  authorities,  associations,  customers  and markets.  These  laboratories  bring  together  in  one place  the  three  pillars  of  Open  Innovation:  the socialization  of  knowledge  (events,  conferences,",

R&AE activities are managed  across  the  company's Engineering departments using a shared, structured plan. The plan covers all vehicle, powertrain, product, process and service applications.\n\nREACH : Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of CHemicals  is  a  regulation  adopted  in  2006  by  the European Parliament and Council. It has enabled the creation of a Community system for the registration, evaluation and authorization of chemical substances managed  by  the  new  European  Chemicals  Agency (ECHA) based in Helsinki.\n\nThe  implementation  of  REACH  is  the  result  of  three main intentions: to expand knowledge of the health and  environmental  risks  of  over  30,000  chemical substances,  to  implement  a  substitution  policy  for the most  harmful  substances  and  to  entrust manufacturing  and  exporting  companies  with  the evaluation and management of risks linked to these substances.\n\nReFactory : in November  2020,  Renault Group announced  the  transformation  of  its  site  in  Flins  to create the Re-Factory, Europe's first circular economy  factory  dedicated  to  mobility,  with  the target of a negative CO2 balance by 2030.\n\nRenaulution: strategic plan presented on January 14, 2021, which aims to redirect Renault Group's strategy from volume to value creation. It is structured in three phases launched in parallel:\n\n- \u25cf the  'Resurrection'  phase,  running  until  2023,  will focus on margin recovery and cash generation;\n- \u25cf the  'Renovation'  phase,  running  until  2025,  will bring  renewal  and  enrichment  to  the  ranges, contributing to brand profitability;\n- \u25cf the 'Revolution' phase, which will start in 2025, will pivot  the  Group's  business  model  to  tech,  energy and mobility, making Renault Group a frontrunner in the value chain of new mobility.\n\nRenault Group: Renault Group is at the cutting-edge of mobility  that  is  going  through  a  reinvention  process. Thanks  to  its  alliance  with  Nissan  and  Mitsubishi Motors, and its unique electrification expertise, Renault Group  draws  on  the  complementary  nature  of  its  five brands - Renault - Dacia - LADA - Alpine and Mobilize and offers sustainable and innovative mobility solutions to its customers.
