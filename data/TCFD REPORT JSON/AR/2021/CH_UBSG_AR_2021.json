        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders,\n\n2021  was  the  second  year  shaped  by  the  pandemic,  which challenged and affected every aspect of society - from healthcare to economics,  to  politics, to human  interactions.  UBS's performance in 2021 speaks to our resilience, our progress and our future path. In 2022 we intend to continue making progress on our strategic goals, and we remain dedicated to our clients, shareholders, employees and society.\n\nThe  current  geopolitical  situation  has  led  to  heightened volatility across global markets. We are shocked by the violence and tragedy caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected and those who are suffering.\n\nWe  are  working  to  implement  sanctions  imposed  by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others - all of which have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals. These events, together with counter-sanctions and other measures taken by Russia, will have ongoing effects on the markets and the global economy.\n\n## 2021 backdrop and our financial performance\n\nDespite  the  continuing  pandemic,  market  conditions  were constructive in 2021, with positive investor sentiment throughout the year. Growth rebounded, with the global economy expanding 6.1% after contracting 3.1% in 2020. Global equities delivered total returns of 18.5%. Economic, social and geopolitical tensions increased  during  the  year,  raising  questions  around  the sustainability and shape of the recovery. The pandemic adversely impacted certain economic sectors, while supply chains and labor markets remained challenging. A potential resurgence in global inflation and tight labor markets in many countries could lead to more  restrictive  monetary  policy,  and  this  has  become  an additional concern for the market.\n\nWithin  this  environment,  we  delivered  a  strong  financial performance in 2021. We had the highest pre-tax and net profit in 15 years, a 17.5% return on CET1 capital and a 14.1% return on tangible equity. We maintained our cost / income ratio under 74%, which is in line with 2020 and more than six percentage points better than the two years before that. For the second year in a row, we exceeded all our targets, with all regions and businesses contributing to our performance. We deepened our relationships with clients, resulting in high levels of activity and strong flows across all our segments. This business momentum led to our highest revenues in over a decade.\n\nOur results included two exceptional items. The first item is a loss of USD 861 million that we incurred in the first half of 2021 on the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business. We have conducted a thorough review, we have put in place  appropriate  measures  to  strengthen  our  relevant  risk management processes, and we have reflected the matter in our annual performance assessment and compensation processes. The second item occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021, when we took additional provisions of EUR 650 million, bringing the total to  EUR 1.1  billion  for  the  French  cross-border  matter.  As announced in December 2021, we have filed an appeal with the\n\nFrench Supreme Court regarding the decision of the Court of Appeal. This enables us to thoroughly assess the verdict of the Court of Appeal and to determine the next steps in the best interests of our stakeholders.\n\n## Our purpose and strategic direction\n\nIn  2021,  we  reconfirmed  and  continued  to  implement  our strategy. Last April, we introduced our purpose 'Reimagining the power of investing. Connecting people for a better world,' which unites all of UBS behind a common goal. It's the starting point for every strategic decision; it will shape our future, help us capture opportunities and allow us to grow from our already strong position.\n\nOur vision is to convene THE global ecosystem for investing: where thought leadership is impactful, people and ideas are connected, and opportunities are brought to life. In order to achieve  this  vision,  we  identified  five  strategic  imperatives: (i) supporting,  growing  and  aligning  our  network  of  clients, connections and contributors; (ii) increasing our focus by playing where we are positioned to win; (iii) enabling technology and making  it  our  differentiator;  (iv) becoming  simpler  and  more efficient so it is easier for our clients to bank with us; and (v) mobilizing employees behind our vision and acting as one firm.\n\n## Supporting clients, society and employees\n\nWe retained our clients' trust as they continued to turn to us for our content, advice and solutions. This resulted in USD 107 billion in net new fee-generating assets in wealth management and USD 48 billion of net new money in Asset Management. We also helped clients finance businesses, homes and other liquidity needs by extending USD 28 billion of net new loans to clients across wealth management and personal banking. We now manage over USD 4.6 trillion in assets on behalf of our clients. And we increased our philanthropic activities, both with and for clients and as a firm.\n\nAt UBS, we are committed to supporting the communities in which we work, to understand the issues they face, and develop long-term partnerships to catalyze positive change in people's lives. We focus our efforts on social inequalities by supporting education and skills development as areas where we can drive sustainable change. We also enable our employees to support their  communities  through  volunteering  by  partnering  with organizations such as Powercoders in Switzerland, which trains refugees in computer science and information technology skills. The pandemic meant we continued to provide COVID-19 relief to the most vulnerable in 2021, including recovery and rebuilding efforts  through  our  community  partners.  Currently,  to  help victims of the war in Ukraine, UBS Optimus Foundation and our Community  Impact  teams  are  providing  emergency  relief  to refugees through the International Rescue Committee and are matching the first USD 5 million of donations from employees and clients, creating a combined impact of USD 10 million.",

Hamers Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nDue to the ongoing pressure placed on employees by closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we implemented new ways to help employees through these difficult times. We offered tools and resources to support employees' physical, mental and social wellbeing, and provided extra flexibility for child and elderly care. As a result of our experience during the pandemic, we are developing more permanent ways of flexible working for our employees, while supporting a safe return to our offices as economies reopen.\n\nWe believe a hybrid approach will support a better work / life balance and make us a more attractive employer, appealing to a more  diverse  pool  of  applicants,  such  as  working  parents, caregivers and those in continuing education. Moreover, flexible working, by the nature of its emphasis on technology and virtual collaboration, encourages an innovative mindset across our firm - which is a big part of our strategy. In addition, we are reshaping our future real estate footprint, reducing the number of buildings and square meters we occupy, while also investing in our locations to  reimagine  our  workplace  and  support  our  sustainability ambitions.\n\n## Capturing growth opportunities\n\nAfter introducing our purpose and strategy on a page, we took steps to ensure UBS is well positioned to capture the areas we see as having the greatest growth potential. For example, regionally, we expect most wealth will be created in the US and Asia Pacific. As a result, we have identified these as key growth markets and we have prioritized investments in those regions. EMEA continues to be a core region for us and important to our global footprint, and a region where we can improve profitability and drive focused growth. And in Switzerland, we are further building on our position as a digital leader.\n\nAffluent clients and entrepreneurs are expected to generate high  revenue  growth.  So  we  are  also  expanding  into  new segments to reach a much broader set of clients. Our plans to acquire Wealthfront, announced in January 2022, will help us deliver a digital wealth management offering to Millennial and Gen Z affluent investors in the US, allow us to expand our wallet share, lower the cost to serve and drive long-term growth.\n\nTechnology plays a large part in how we grow and deliver the personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless services that clients expect. That is why we are further investing in digitalization, including artificial intelligence, data and analytics - areas we have already been building up for years. We will digitalize what can be made digital and become more agile to deliver faster. While not increasing our total expenditure on technology, we are increasing the amount we spend on our strategic priorities. Our aim is to deliver around USD 1 billion in-year gross cost saves by 2023 in order to fund our growth initiatives.\n\n## Leading in sustainability - our path to Net Zero\n\nOver the years, UBS has established itself as a recognized leader for sustainability in the financial sector. Recent ratings such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and CDP have reconfirmed this. To maximize impact and direct capital to where it is needed most, we focus on three areas: (i) Planet, where we are making climate a clear priority as we shift toward a lower carbon future; (ii) People,  where  we  are  taking  action,  both  within  our  own workplace  and  within  wider  society,  to  promote  a  diverse, equitable and inclusive society; and (iii) Partnerships, where we are uniting with others and bringing people together around common goals to achieve greater impact. To meet our impact goals, we started assigning all Group Executive Board members environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related objectives in 2021.\n\nSustainability is not just something we focus on because we think it is the right thing to do. We also have a duty: to help private  clients  protect  and  grow  their  wealth,  to  help  firms transition to sustainable ways of doing business, to ensure clients' long-term  success  and  to  support  them  in  fulfilling  their responsibility to society. We strongly believe that this is the best way to remain profitable and attractive to clients, investors and talent in the long term. We are seeing an ever-increasing demand in sustainable investing - invested assets in sustainability-focus and impact strategies increased 78% in 2021 - and we will continue to meet this need by growing our offering.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "In 2021, we published our Net-Zero and Beyond statement, which sets out our commitment to transition our firm to net zero and help our clients meet their transition targets by 2050. We have developed and are transparently disclosing a climate road map with intermediate targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035. The 'Say-on-Climate' advisory vote at the upcoming Annual General Meeting (the AGM) is a key milestone on our journey to net zero, reflecting our commitment to our shareholders having their say on our firm's climate roadmap. Furthermore, we strongly believe in cross-company and cross-industry collaboration when it comes to achieving net zero. As such, we are a founding member of both the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance.\n\n## Updated targets and ambitions to create value across stakeholders\n\nWe are aiming to create sustainable value through the cycle. Reflecting our improved operating performance over the last two years, we updated our financial targets and kept our capital guidance unchanged, including deploying up to one-third of Group risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator  (LRD)  in  the  Investment  Bank.  In  addition,  we outlined selected commercial and ESG aspirations to support the achievement of these targets.\n\nFirst, for society at large, we are committed to building a better world  through  our  sustainability  focus  and  the  numerous commitments you can find in our 2021 Annual and Sustainability Reports. For example, we aim to reach net-zero emissions across our business by 2050 and net-zero emissions resulting from our own operations by 2025. We will also help our clients do good, as we aspire to raise USD 1 billion in philanthropy assets to reach 25 million beneficiaries and we are targeting USD 400 billion in sustainability-focus and impact investments by 2025.\n\nSecond, for our clients, we will assess how we are doing through our commercial aspirations. We are optimistic that we can maintain growth rates from net new fee-generating assets of 5% and above over the cycle. As a result, we aspire to surpass USD 5 trillion, and then USD 6 trillion, in invested assets as clients entrust us with managing their investments.\n\nAnd third, we are targeting a 15-18% return on CET1 capital. This is significantly higher than our previous target range and reflects the progress we have made over the last two years. To consistently achieve this, we are targeting a cost / income ratio of 70-73%. We have ambitious growth plans across our franchise and are retaining our target to grow profits in global wealth management by 10-15% over the cycle.\n\n## Our capital returns today and in the future\n\nReflecting  the  step-up  in  profitability,  we  are  proposing  to increase the dividend to USD 0.50 per share for the 2021 financial year,  and  to  have  a  progressive  cash  dividend  thereafter. Additional excess capital will be used to buy back our shares, and we repurchased USD 2.6 billion of shares in 2021. Given our strong capital position, we are looking to repurchase up to USD 5 billion in 2022.\n\n## Proposed elections to the Board of Directors\n\nAxel A. Weber is reaching the ten-year term limit set in our Organization Regulations as the Chairman of the Board and will therefore be stepping down in April 2022. On 20 November 2021, the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG announced that it will nominate Colm Kelleher as the new Chairman and Lukas G\u00e4hwiler as the new Vice Chairman for election to the Board at the AGM on 6 April 2022.\n\n## Virtual AGM in 2022\n\nTo protect the health of shareholders and employees, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued uncertainty, the Board of Directors has decided that the 2022 AGM will be held as a webcast. As such, it will not be possible to physically attend the AGM. Nevertheless, we look forward to your feedback and to welcoming you to this year's virtual AGM on 6 April.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAxel A. Weber Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Both banks were well established and successful in their own right. Union Bank of Switzerland had grown organically to become the largest Swiss bank. In contrast, SBC had grown mainly through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, including S.G. Warburg in 1995.\n\nIn 2000, we acquired PaineWebber, a US brokerage and asset management firm with roots going back to 1879, establishing us as a significant player in the US. Over the past 50 years, we have also built a strong presence in the Asia Pacific region, where we are the largest private bank 1 , with access to asset management and investment banking capabilities.\n\nAfter incurring significant losses in the 2008 financial crisis, we started a strategic transformation in 2011 toward a business model focused on our traditional businesses: wealth management, and personal and corporate banking in Switzerland. We sought to revert to our roots, emphasizing a client-centric model that requires less risk-taking and capital, and we successfully completed that transformation.\n\n- 1 1 Digital Wealth Management

we are a leading truly global wealth manager, 2 with over USD 3.3 trillion in invested assets, a leading Swiss personal and corporate bank, a large-scale and diversified global asset manager, and a focused investment bank.\n\nIn  2014,  we  began  adapting  our  legal  entity  structure  in response to too-big-to-fail requirements and other regulatory initiatives. First, we established UBS Group AG as the ultimate parent holding company for the Group. In 2015, we transferred personal  and  corporate  banking  and  Swiss-booked  wealth management businesses from UBS AG to the newly established UBS Switzerland AG. That same year we set up UBS Business Solutions AG as the Group's service company. In 2016, UBS Americas Holding LLC became the intermediate holding company for our US subsidiaries and our wealth management subsidiaries across Europe were merged into UBS Europe SE. In 2019, we merged UBS Limited, our UK-headquartered subsidiary, into UBS Europe SE, our Germany-headquartered European subsidiary.\n\nThe chart below gives an overview of our principal legal entities and our legal entity structure.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/history for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' and 'Regulatory and legal developments' sections of this report for more information",

Connecting  people  for  a  better  world. Our purpose unites us behind a common goal, provides direction on the way forward and helps us build on our strengths.\n\nWe  will  reimagine  the  power  of  investing  by  developing solutions that change how people look at finance and investing.\n\nThe power of investing can support achieving one's personal aspirations,  whether  through  buying  a  home,  growing  a company, supporting future financial goals or having an impact.\n\nWe will connect people, both internally and externally, to convene  an  ecosystem  where  ideas  and  opportunities  come together to be successful and to make a difference.\n\nWe will help build a better world by thinking sustainably and creating opportunities that help reduce, rather than contribute to, inequalities.\n\n## Sustainability is at the core of our purpose\n\nWe know finance has a powerful influence on the world. At UBS, we are reimagining the power of people and investments, to help create  a  better  world  for  everyone:  a  fairer  society,  a  more prosperous  economy  and  a  healthier  environment.  We  are partnering with our clients to help them mobilize their capital toward  a  more  sustainable  world.  It  is  why  we  have  put sustainability  at  the  heart  of  our  own  purpose.  To  help  us maximize our impact and direct capital to where it is needed most,\n\nwe are focusing on three key areas to drive the sustainability transition: planet, people, partnerships.\n\nPlanet: We are making climate a clear priority as we shift toward a lower-carbon future. We will provide transparency on our milestones along the way to make sure our progress can be tracked. We are not only focused on our own journey; we are also supporting our clients in their own transitions.\n\nPeople: Through our interactions, we are working to address wealth  inequality,  sharpening  the  focus  of  our  client  and corporate philanthropy, and our employee-led community affairs activities centered on health and education.\n\nPartnerships: By working in partnership with other thought leaders and standard setters, our goal is to make an impact on a truly global scale. To create change, we realize that all of us have to unite around common goals. That is why we engage with regulators,  policymakers  and  others  to  create  standards  and support research and development across the financial sector.\n\n## Our promise to our clients\n\nHelping clients to achieve their financial goals is the essence of what we do. We aim to differentiate our service by delivering a client experience that is:\n\n- -Personalized: Our products and services are as personal as our clients' needs.\n- -Relevant: What  we  deliver  to  our  clients  is  relevant  and matters to them.\n- -On-time: Clients set the pace and can act on opportunities anytime and anywhere.\n- -Seamless: Interacting  with  us  is  simple,  seamless,  and intuitive.",

By bringing the best of UBS to our clients in a seamless experience, growing our ecosystem and encouraging connections across it, we can deliver the full power of investing to our clients. Client needs can be more broadly met. Our clients and the trust they place in us will be put at the center of everything we do.

We will prioritize our efforts where we can add the most value and make a difference. To achieve this we are working to reduce duplication and reallocate resources as necessary, all while growing our position as the world's leading wealth manager.\n\n## Technology - make technology our differentiator\n\nWe will use our investments in technology to deliver a seamless client experience as part of our client promise. We have been building our technology foundations over past years. We will move forward by focusing on how clients experience UBS every day, becoming more agile and focusing on outcomes through a modular approach. With this mind, we intend to transform the way we use and consider technology, thinking about it as a differentiator for us.\n\n## Simplification and efficiency - increase ease of doing business and enable our journey\n\nWe can make it easier for our clients to do business with us, as well as for our employees to make decisions and take responsibility. We intend to further streamline and standardize our functions, processes, entities and general ways of doing business to increase efficiency and increase capacity to invest for future growth.\n\n## Culture - mobilize employees behind our future vision and act as one firm\n\nWe already have a strong, inclusive culture, grounded in our three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors.

In  addition,  the  financial  industry  ecosystem  is constantly  evolving,  becoming  even  more  competitive,  open, connected and location-independent every day.\n\nThis presents an opportunity for us to fully embrace technology and make it a differentiator for our firm. Doing so is central to our client promise to deliver a client experience that is personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless.\n\nTo support our ambitions, we have appointed a Group Chief Digital and Information Officer to the Group Executive Board. To guide our digital transformation and to enhance the way we live up to our client promise, we have also established a Leveling up strategy based on five key pillars: Agile@UBS; quarterly business reviews and digital roadmaps; modern tech; automation; and engineering excellence (digital culture).\n\n## Agile@UBS\n\nIn order to deliver digital solutions faster and remain responsive and adaptable, we are introducing a unified agile approach across the whole firm.\n\nTo support this, we have developed a robust framework and rollout  plan,  which  includes  clearly  defined  role  profiles,  a bespoke playbook and a dedicated academy training suite.\n\nCurrently,  we  have  10,000  employees  across  the  firm transitioning to the new Agile@UBS ways of working and we expect this to increase to more than 20,000 by the end of 2022. Relevant resources and training will also be available to all staff, enabling everyone to apply agile principles to their work, thereby helping to deliver an even better client experience.\n\n## Quarterly business reviews and digital roadmaps\n\nQuarterly business reviews (QBRs) and digital roadmaps help us to manage our technology investment portfolio in a more strategic and flexible way. The QBRs serve as a forum to agree on the most important objectives that align with our strategy and are intended to ensure we deliver more frequent and valuable outcomes for our clients. The digital roadmaps help us to keep investment and design decisions aligned to our client promise and our longerterm vision.\n\n## Modern tech\n\nWe believe the bank of the future will leverage a lean, modern tech estate and Cloud-based applications. Modern tech makes a shorter time to market  possible,  removes  dependencies, accelerates  digitalization  and  facilitates  connection  with  the financial industry ecosystem to provide better and faster client services.\n\nIn line with our modern tech ambitions, we migrated over 1,000 applications to the Cloud during 2021 and established a governance  framework  to  identify  and  decommission  legacy technologies.\n\n## Automation\n\nTo  achieve  our  vision,  we  are  building  a  best-on-street development and technology operations experience, powered by modern development tools and automation techniques.\n\nWe have also introduced a new Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics (ADA) center of expertise. ADA will bring together data scientists and analytics experts from across the firm to ensure a consistent firm-wide approach to these topics. ADA will also help empower our strategy and ecosystem, using AI and machine learning for the benefit of our clients.\n\n## Engineering excellence (digital culture)\n\nTo succeed in making technology a differentiator for our firm, we must attract and retain the best engineers, which is only possible by creating and fostering an engineering and digital culture of excellence. Best-in-class tech learning journeys and curricula for our engineers, a respected Certified and Distinguished Engineers framework, an effective hiring strategy, and targeted competency assessments and development plans for our technical staff will be implemented to support this ambition.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Our businesses' section of this report for more information about how we deploy our technology approach in our businesses",

We aim to unlock the power of one UBS through our innovative solutions and differentiated offerings.\n\nWe are at our best when we combine our strengths to provide our clients more comprehensive and better solutions through, for example, a Unified Global Markets team across Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, and a Global Family Office  joint  venture.  Initiatives  such  as  the Group  Franchise Awards encourage employees to look for ways to connect across teams and offer the whole firm to our clients.\n\n## How we deliver the whole firm to our clients - examples\n\n| Wealth management platforms   | In all locations outside the Americas, we utilize the Wealth Management Platform, which is shared  between Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking in Switzerland. This platform  can be navigated intuitively and supports strong advice capabilities across all channels, helping our clients  to benefit from a broader universe of products and services, simplified onboarding, and a better banking  experience. In the Americas, our clients benefit from the Wealth Management Americas Platform, as well  as our innovative partnership with Broadridge, which is aimed at improving productivity and the user  experience by revamping the technology used for our advisors' workstations.                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Separately managed accounts   | In the US, we combined portfolio management and execution resources within Asset Management  during 2020. Alongside this, we introduced a new approach where Global Wealth Management clients  can access selected separately managed account (SMA) strategies in the Americas with no additional  management fees. This transformative move allows our advisors to focus on delivering the best ideas,  solutions and capabilities to our clients, regardless of where they originate in the firm.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Shifts and referrals          | To ensure that our clients are best served according to their needs and foster growth by offering a  universal bank delivery model in Switzerland, we have introduced a holistic collaboration framework for  Personal & Corporate Banking. We systematically initiate client shifts from Personal Banking to Global  Wealth Management when the clients' investing needs become sufficiently complex. In addition, we  encourage our client advisors to continuously generate leads for services provided by other business  divisions. Typical examples are corporate and institutional clients being introduced to Asset Management  for mandate solutions or to the Investment Bank for capital market transactions, thus providing access to  our global expertise, and entrepreneurs being introduced to Global Wealth Management, ensuring |\n| Global Family Office          | Our Global Family Office unit brings together the capabilities of Global Wealth Management, Asset  Management and the Investment Bank to leverage growth opportunities and deliver holistic solutions. It  provides customized, institutional-style services to wealthy families and individuals seeking access to  equity markets and advisory services, and assisting clients with raising capital from public and private  markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Global Lending Unit           | As a further step in serving the financing and lending needs of all UBS clients worldwide, we set up a  division-agnostic Global Lending Unit in 2020. Its key objective is delivering lending capabilities to clients  of both the Investment Bank and Global Wealth Management.

The spectrum of our services ranges from investment management to estate planning and corporate  finance  advice,  in  addition  to  specific  wealth management products and services. The business is managed globally across the regions.\n\n## Organizational changes\n\nAs part of the Group-wide creation of the Artificial Intelligence, Data and Analytics center of expertise in October 2021, Global Wealth  Management  established  the  Smart  Technologies  & Advanced  Analytics  Team.  Leveraging  our  Evidence  Lab Innovations team's experience and  expertise, the Smart Technologies & Advanced Analytics Team focuses on developing a smart ecosystem that applies artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and data science to empower our advisors with insights and tools that help them anticipate client needs and deepen client relationships.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the Global Wealth Management Operations team was formally integrated into Global Wealth Management, following the Group-wide decision to move each of the firm's business-aligned Operations teams into their respective divisions in order to become even more client-centric, agile and digital, while creating a seamless experience for our clients.\n\nWe  continually  review  all  our  businesses  for  growth opportunities, future potential and efficiency. As a result, in 2021, we completed the sale of our domestic wealth management business in Austria. We also announced our intention to sell our domestic wealth management business in Spain. As part of the latter sale, the parties aim to negotiate a cooperation agreement to  provide  clients  with  access  to  selected  UBS  products  and services. We expect this deal to close in the third quarter of 2022. In December 2021, we signed an agreement to sell UBS Swiss Financial Advisers  AG,  a  Switzerland-based  SEC-registered investment advisor and FINMA-licensed securities firm that offers US clients tailored investment solutions. On 26 January 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire Wealthfront, an industryleading digital wealth management provider. This acquisition is aligned with our growth strategy in the Americas, will broaden our reach among affluent investors and add a new digital-first offering, increasing our distribution capabilities.\n\n## Our focus\n\nWe serve high net worth and ultra high net worth individuals, families and family offices worldwide, as well as affluent clients in selected markets.

Growing from just three employees in 2011 to over 1,100 by year-end 2021, our CIO has a presence in 18 locations and is responsible for investment advice and management of more than USD 3.3 trillion in assets globally.\n\nOur CIO's insights provide the foundation for the global UBS ecosystem, which connects clients with content and solutions. Close integration between  idea  generation  and  product development results in CIO-aligned solutions delivering real value to  clients  and  spurring  innovations  such  as  the  investment modules in UBS Manage Advanced [My Way] .

For example, in the Americas, our Private Markets OneBank Partnership has established one centralized function to manage the origination and distribution of all private markets transactions, side by side with the cross-divisional origination of the Investment Bank's Global Banking business. Additionally, to ensure  we  are  placing  resources  close  to  clients,  dedicated investment  bankers  are  now  embedded  in  Global  Wealth Management's Private Wealth Services Hubs across the US.

We have strategically built strong positions in the fastest-growing client segment (ultra high net worth) and region  (Asia  Pacific).  The  size  and  the  diversification  of  our footprint, as well as our premium brand and reputation, would be difficult and expensive to replicate.\n\n## What we offer\n\nOur distinctive approach to wealth management is designed to help our clients pursue what matters most to them.\n\nWe  aim  to  offer  clients  the  best  solutions,  services  and expertise  globally.  Our  experts  provide  thought  leadership, investment analysis and investment strategies, and develop and source solutions for our clients.

Our  product  specialists deliver investment solutions, including our flagship investment mandates, as well as innovative long-term themes and sustainable investment offerings.\n\nClients benefit from our comprehensive expertise, including wealth planning, investing, sustainability and impact investing, philanthropy, corporate and banking services, as well as family advisory services. We also offer extensive mortgage, securitiesbased and structured lending expertise.\n\nIn 2020, we became the first major global financial institution to make sustainable investments the preferred solution for private clients investing globally. This focus led to high levels of client activity in 2021 and reflected both our own belief in sustainable and  impact  investing  from  a  performance  perspective  and increased client demand for relevant advice and solutions. Our discretionary  offerings  aligned  to  our  sustainable  investing strategic asset allocation exceeded USD 30 billion in invested assets as of 31 December 2021.\n\nOur clients accounted for 75% (USD 647 million) of MPM Capital's Oncology Impact Fund 2 (OIF 2), which closed in 2021, following the record-setting success of the UBS Oncology Impact Fund (OIF 1) in 2016.

As part of our long-term cooperation with  Partners  Group,  we  have  enhanced  our  offering  by broadening access to private equity. Clients can diversify their mandates into private equity by accessing fully paid-in solutions provided by Partners Group and UBS.\n\nIn 2020, we launched UBS Manage Advanced [My Way] , a solution enabling clients to truly individualize their portfolios.

Personal & Corporate Banking is the core of our universal bank in Switzerland.\n\n## Organizational changes\n\nOn 1 July 2021, the Personal & Corporate Banking Operations team was formally integrated into Personal & Corporate Banking, following the Group-wide decision to move each of the firm's business-aligned Operations teams into their respective divisions in order to become even more client-centric, agile and digital, while creating a seamless experience for our clients.\n\n## Our focus\n\nContinued  innovation  and  constant  customer  focus  are  the factors that differentiate us, as a market leader across all business areas we strive to grow at a rate higher than the market. We aim to be digital at the core: our client promise is to bring the bank to the app, enabling a user experience that is personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, digitalization had become a major part of our everyday lives. The pandemic has increased its relevance and accelerated the pace of technological change.\n\nTo  drive  this  transformation,  we  need  to  better  connect business and technology, focus on the needs of our clients, and empower our teams end to end; in other words, we need to be agile. The agile transformation is essential for every part of our organization. Agile is not new to us - we previously gained experience with the Digital Factory and Lighthouses - but we are now scaling it to the next level. In 2021, we set up a new virtual Agile Delivery Organization .\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Clients' in the 'How we create value for our stakeholders' section and 'Leveling up technology' in the 'Our strategy' section of this report for more information about innovation and digitalization\n\nIn 2021, we brought additional sustainable finance solutions to the market. We introduced Green Mortgages brokered via key4 , the first Swiss real estate platform for investment properties offering sustainable mortgages in Switzerland. In addition, we now offer Swiss retail clients Renovation Mortgages that provide preferential interest rates to support energy-efficient renovations\n\nand construction. On the investment side, we complemented our UBS Vitainvest product family with a passive solution, making it possible to invest for retirement in a sustainable way through Swiss third-pillar pension funds and vested benefits accounts. We also launched the innovative UBS Sustainability Analytics offering, helping  institutional  clients  to  achieve  full  transparency  by screening their portfolios with regard to sustainability aspects.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability-related topics\n\nWe collaborate with other companies to better satisfy our clients' diverse needs. For example, in 2021, we started a project with  Swiss  fintech  start-up  Yokoy  to  provide  extensive  cash management  services  to  corporate  clients,  from  automated generation of expense reports to validation of supplier invoices.\n\n## How we operate\n\nWe operate primarily in our Swiss home market. With our Personal Banking and Corporate & Institutional Clients business areas, we are organized into 10 regions, covering distinct Swiss economic areas. Due to increasing client demand for remote access and the increased offering via our in-demand digital and remote channels, in the first quarter of 2021 we reduced our branch network by 44 branches to 195 branches. This followed the closure of 28 branches in 2020.\n\nWe also support the international business activities of our Swiss corporate  clients  through  local  hubs  in  New  York,  Frankfurt, Singapore and Hong Kong SAR. No other Swiss bank offers its corporate clients local banking capabilities abroad.\n\nIn Personal Banking, our main competitors are Credit Suisse, PostFinance, Raiffeisen, cantonal banks, and other regional and local Swiss banks; we also face competition from international neobanks and other national digital market participants. Areas of competition are basic banking services, mortgages and foreign exchange, as well as investment mandates and funds.\n\nIn  Corporate  &  Institutional  Clients,  Credit  Suisse,  cantonal banks and globally active foreign banks are our main competitors. We compete in basic banking services, cash management, trade and  export  finance,  asset  servicing,  investment  advice  for institutional clients, corporate finance and lending, and cash and securities transactions for banks.",

We are continuing the expansion of our  world-class  capabilities  through:  product  and  service innovation; dedicated research; integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into our investment processes by leveraging  our  proprietary  analytics;  and  active  corporate engagement.\n\nDuring 2021, we enhanced our ESG methodology and data sets, deepened the integration of carbon data into our investment processes, and worked to expand our ESG integration across alternative asset classes. We also increased the entire range of UBS sustainable exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which represented USD 40 billion in invested assets as of 31 December 2021. These ETFs provide exposure to various asset classes with significantly lower carbon intensity compared with their respective market cap-weighted parent indices and help investors to both reduce their climate risks and benefit from opportunities arising from the shift toward a lower-carbon economy.\n\nIn addition, we continued to expand our Climate Aware suite of products and our Climate Aware invested assets grew to USD 23 billion, a 53% increase year on year. Our sustainability focus and impact invested assets totaled USD 172 billion, a 77% increase year on year.\n\nAs a founding member of the Net Zero Asset Managers 1 initiative, we published an interim target and have committed to align USD 235 billion of invested assets by 2030.

        "page_content": "## Our environment\n\n## Market climate\n\n## Global economic developments in 2021\n\n2021 was a positive year for the global economy and most markets. Growth rebounded, with the global economy expanding 6.1%, after contracting 3.0% in 2020. The recovery was also broad based, with all major nations experiencing a revival in demand as pandemic restrictions were gradually relaxed and the policies of major central banks remained supportive.\n\nSwiss GDP increased 3.5% in 2021, after decreasing 2.5% in 2020. US GDP grew 5.7%, after decreasing 3.4%. The Eurozone economy expanded 5.2%, after contracting 6.5% in the prior year. UK GDP increased 7.2% in 2021, after a decrease of 9.4% in 2020.\n\nChina's economy grew 8.1%, up from 2.2% in 2020, although momentum slowed toward the end of 2021 and into 2022. Other leading Asian economies recovered strongly in 2021, with India's GDP growing 8.7%, Singapore's GDP increasing 7.6% and South Korea's GDP expanding 3.9%. Japan experienced less growth, with GDP increasing 1.7% after a 4.5% contraction in 2020.\n\nGrowth  in  the  top  emerging  markets  was  mixed,  with  a moderate 1.7% growth rate in Thailand and 3.7% in Indonesia, compared with a more robust 5.3% in Mexico and 4.5% in Brazil.\n\nElevated inflation emerged as a concern through 2021 in much of the world, as the pandemic continued to disrupt supply chains and shift patterns of demand. By the end of the year, US inflation was running at the fastest pace since 1982 on a year-on-year basis.  This  caused  the  US  Federal  Reserve  to  move  toward monetary  tightening,  announcing  a  scaling  back  of  asset\n\npurchases and pointing toward rate rises. Inflation was contained in Switzerland, at 0.6% for the year, but climbed swiftly in the Eurozone, from 0.3% in 2020 to 2.6% in 2021. Meanwhile, prices in Japan declined 0.2% in 2021, having been flat in 2020.\n\nFinancial  markets,  both  equities  and  fixed  income,  were resilient in the face of continuing waves of COVID-19 infections. Global equities delivered total returns of 18.5% in 2021. The US outperformed:  MSCI  USA  delivered  total  returns  of  27%, outperforming the MSCI All Country World index by 8 percentage points  and  taking  its  share  of  the  global  index's  market capitalization to a record level of 48%. The Eurozone, Japanese, Swiss and UK equity markets all gained ground. China, however, was an underperformer: after reaching a record high in February 2021, MSCI China declined over the rest of the year, driven by increased regulation on the technology and property sectors, energy shortages, and a slowing economy. The index delivered negative returns of 22.4% in 2021, negatively impacting the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets index overall, which decreased 2.5% in 2021.\n\nGovernment  bond  markets  were  also  resilient,  especially against a backdrop of historically high inflation. The yield on 10year US Treasuries ended the year at 1.5%, only a modest increase from 0.9% at the start of the year. With inflation rising, but nominal yields staying low, US real yields traded as low as minus 1.2%,  the  lowest  level  since  the  inception  of  the  Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) market in 1997. The yield on 10-year German Bunds remained negative through 2021, ending the year at minus 0.18%.",

        "page_content": "## Industry trends\n\nAlthough  our  industry  has  been  heavily  affected  by  various regulatory  developments  over  the  past  decade,  technological transformation  and  changing  client  expectations  are  further emerging as key drivers of change today, increasingly affecting the competitive landscape, as well as our products, service models and operations. In parallel, our industry continues to be materially driven  by  changes  in  financial  market  and  macroeconomic conditions.\n\n## Client expectations\n\nAs technology progresses, clients more rapidly redefine the way they live, work and interact with others. This is reshaping clients' expectations toward financial services firms, as their reference points are increasingly influenced by experiences with companies outside our sector, where technology-supported and data-driven solutions  are  progressively  enabling  a  more  seamless  and improved  client  experience.  These  services  often  focus  on convenience and personalization, and drive toward holistically addressing clients' needs and facilitating community building. Therefore our franchise needs to evolve, as clients measure us against new standards.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nMarkets  around  the  world  are  undergoing  a  profound transformation as company business models evolve and investors factor  in  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and  other sustainable themes with regard to investment risk and return.\n\nShifting societal values and greater regulation are supporting client demand.  Investors  are  adding  sustainable  investing strategies to their portfolios, with the fastest growth around funds focused on climate. Industry inflows into sustainable funds have  accelerated  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the sustainable investing market share remains above pre-pandemic levels.\n\nOur view is that this trend plays to UBS's strengths, as we have been at the forefront of sustainable finance for over two decades, making us well placed to continue developing the innovative products and solutions our institutional and private clients need.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about sustainability matters\n\n## Digitalization\n\nDigitalization in the financial services industry is accelerating and has been given further momentum by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Banks have demonstrated their ability to take on a vast increase in the number of clients switching to digital channels\n\nwhile  ensuring  operational  resilience.  As  a  result,  clients increasingly trust digital solutions and are now demanding even more seamless, personalized digital products and services tailored to their needs. Regional and demographic differences in the acceptance and use of digital technologies are narrowing across all client segments, thus increasing the number of digital users. This trend requires financial institutions to focus even more on fully digital and digitally enhanced service models and digitally enabled ecosystems.\n\nAs governments reacted to the outbreak of the pandemic by imposing restrictions on physical interactions, digital communication, with clients and employees alike, established new remote ways of working, which are expected to also be used by some companies in post-pandemic scenarios, enabling them to attract  an  even  wider  array  of  talent  than  before.  The digitalization  of  the  financial  services  industry  has  led  to  a structural shift in the workforce: more and better engineers are required to keep banks at the forefront of technology, thus setting them into direct competition with technology companies beyond the borders of the financial sector.\n\nContinuous investment in technology is driving automation and simplification of labor-intensive processes, improving banks' operational efficiency and freeing up resources to focus on client needs. Decision making is becoming increasingly data-driven, with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence enabling banks to address client needs in an even more targeted manner.\n\nNascent technologies, such as distributed ledger technology, are expected to mature over the coming years and are likely to reshape our industry. They provide opportunities to overcome existing financial system frictions, broaden access to underbanked communities and make previously unviable products or services available to the financial services industry.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nMany regions and businesses in the financial services sector are still highly fragmented. We expect further consolidation, with the key  drivers  being  ongoing  margin  pressure,  a  push  for  cost efficiencies and increasing scale advantages resulting from the fixed costs of technology, and regulatory requirements. Many banks currently seek increasing exposure and access to regions with attractive growth profiles, such as Asia and other emerging markets, through local acquisitions or partnerships. The increased focus on core capabilities and geographical footprint, as well as the  ongoing  simplification  of  business  models  to  reduce operational and compliance risks, is likely to drive further disposals of non-core businesses and assets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may further accelerate consolidation, as banks face increasing  threats  from  digitalization,  low  interest  rates  and intensified competition.",

        "page_content": "## New competitors\n\nOur competitive environment is evolving. In addition to traditional competitors in the asset-gathering businesses, new entrants are targeting selected parts of the value chain. However, we have not yet seen a fundamental unbundling of the value chain and client relationships,  which  might  ultimately  result  in  the  further disintermediation of banks by new competitors. Over the long term, we believe large platform companies entering the financial services industry could pose a significant competitive threat, given their strong client franchises and access to client data, if they decide to broaden the scope of their services. Fintech firms are gaining  momentum,  which  has  been  accelerated  by  the COVID-19 pandemic, causing increased use of remote solutions. However, such firms have not to date materially disrupted our asset-gathering businesses. The trend for forging partnerships between new entrants and incumbent banks is continuing, as technology and innovation help banks overcome new challenges.\n\n## Regulation\n\nAlthough the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still evident, regulators are re-focusing their attention toward policy areas that were already in motion before the pandemic started, including prudential regulation and anti-money laundering (AML), and to emerging  policy  topics,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  digital innovation and environmental, social and governance (ESG).\n\nSustainable  finance  and  climate  risk  were  a  key  focus  of policymakers in 2021, with the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) acting as a catalyst for action. We expect further policy developments, including in the areas of climaterelated disclosures, climate-related financial risks and ESG.\n\nThe acceleration of the digital finance agenda, which in part resulted  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  continues  to  trigger action from regulators and this will likely further intensify. Among such action, we expect further progress on the regulation of cryptoassets and stablecoins, as well as on the ongoing work on central bank digital currencies and digital engagement practices.\n\nThe national implementation of the Basel framework remains another important focus area, but there is a significant risk of divergence in the timing of implementation, as well as the content of the provisions. EU authorities have proposed a package of measures aimed at implementing the remaining Basel III elements by 2025, i.e., two years after the timeline envisaged by the Basel Committee  on  Banking  Supervision,  while  the  authorities  in Switzerland and the UK are expected to consult on their approach in 2022. Implementation in Switzerland is expected in 2024 and in the UK no earlier than March 2023. Implementation in the US is still uncertain.\n\nIn addition, regulatory authorities continue to refine existing regulations, including the finalization of the Swiss too-big-to-fail framework,  with  a  current  focus  on  additional  liquidity requirements for systemically important banks. The regulators are also advancing the regulatory framework in key policy areas, including  anti-money  laundering,  operational  resilience  and\n\noutsourcing arrangements, and putting an emerging policy focus on diversity and inclusion.\n\nFinally, central banks and regulators continue to learn the lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic. An important area of concern is understanding the effects of contagion in financial markets, particularly financial stability risks emanating from nonbank financial institutions.\n\nMany  of  these  developments  are  taking  place  in  an environment characterized by significant political uncertainties, including  geopolitical  tensions  that  could  pose  additional challenges to the provision of cross-border financial services and rapidly evolving societal expectations toward financial institutions.\n\nWe believe the adaptations made to our business model and our proactive management of regulatory change put us in a strong position to absorb upcoming changes to the regulatory environment.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Wealth creation 1\n\nDespite the economic tumult related to the pandemic, the global high  net  worth  individual  population  and  financial  wealth increased in 2020 6.3% and 7.6%, respectively.\n\nThe United States continued to lead, with high net worth individual wealth growth of 12.3%; in Asia Pacific, such wealth expanded 8.4% and in Europe 4.5%. In line with previous trends, the ultra high net worth individual segment led wealth growth, with an average of 9.1%. Today, 44% of global financial wealth is concentrated in North America, followed by Asia (26%) and Europe (21%). 2\n\nBy segment, approximately a third of global high net worth individual wealth is held by individuals with wealth in excess of USD 30 million, 23% by individuals with wealth ranging from USD 5 million to USD 30 million and the remaining approximately 43% is within the wealth segment between USD 1 million and USD 5 million.\n\nWealth is being created at a faster rate for a number of key client groups, including female clients and entrepreneurs. We also see significant wealth transition to the next generation over the coming decade.\n\nThe outlook for wealth remains positive, with North America, Asia (excluding Japan) and Western Europe expected to account for 87% of new financial wealth growth worldwide between now and 2025. 2\n\n## Wealth transfer\n\nDemographic  and  socioeconomic  developments  continue  to generate shifts in wealth. Over the next 10 to 15 years, the 'next gen,' composed of individuals currently between the ages of 20 and 50, will be an influential driver of future growth, as those people accumulate significant financial wealth from inheritance or liquidity events. 2\n\n1 1 All the figures are from the Capgemini World Wealth Report 2021 unless otherwise stated and refer to the 2020 financial year. The Capgemini World Wealth Report 2021 defines wealth segmentation as follows: those with wealth of greater than USD 30 million are classified as ultra high net worth individuals; USD 1-30 million for high net worth individuals. 2 2 Based on BCG Global Wealth Report 2021. Wealth concentration is based on financial assets by regions and excludes real assets and liabilities.",

        "page_content": "As a group, next gens have a longer investment horizon, a greater appetite for risk and often a desire to use wealth to create a positive societal impact alongside investment returns. As shown in the Wealth-X report 'World Ultra Wealth Report 2021,' the proportion of ultra-wealthy women has also been on a gradual upward  trend  in  recent  years,  reflecting  changing  cultural attitudes  and  growth  in  female  entrepreneurship,  as  well  as wealth transfers between generations.\n\nWe are responding to the evolving wealth landscape with a framework that addresses all aspects of our clients' financial lives, called UBS Wealth Way . It begins with discovery questions and a conversation with clients about what is most important to them. We  help  clients  organize  their  financial  life  along  three  key strategies: Liquidity to help provide cash flow for short-term expenses; Longevity for long-term needs; and Legacy for needs that go beyond their own and help improve the lives of others, a key part of wealth transfer planning.\n\n## Search for yield\n\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors have faced a very different investment landscape when compared with the  last  decade,  with  higher  rates  of  economic  growth  in developed markets and most notably higher inflation.\n\nNevertheless, we expect changes in monetary policies of the central banks of Switzerland and Europe, which have kept interest rates at historically low levels, to be gradual. The US Federal Reserve has quickly adjusted to a higher-rate path, but the overall expected rates remain low in a historical context. Therefore, while this will create new opportunities for investors in the bond and equity markets, the overall low-yield environment will continue.\n\nAs a result, investors searching for sustainable high returns for the longer term continue to diversify into illiquid alternatives (e.g., private equity, property, hedge funds and infrastructure) that can deliver  compelling  risk-adjusted  returns.  At  the  same  time, investors continue to look for low-cost, efficient passive strategies across liquid equity markets. We believe the breadth of Asset Management's investment expertise enables us to find the right solutions for clients across asset classes and regions.",

        "page_content": "## Our response to COVID-19\n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused a globally unprecedented situation in 2020, continued to affect UBS and its employees and required our ongoing focus on safeguarding the well-being of our employees and their families, on serving our clients and ensuring operational continuity.\n\nThe rebound in economic activity in 2021 and expectations of further economic recovery was accompanied by the spread of new variants that resulted in all-time high numbers of COVID-19 infections and associated disruption.\n\n## Our support for clients and the economies in which we operate\n\nWe  continued  to  support  our  clients  with  advice  needed  to manage their assets and liabilities, along with actively developing investment solutions and global insights.\n\nThe program established by the Swiss Federal Council in March 2020  to  support  small  and  medium-sized  entities  (SMEs)  by guaranteeing loans granted by banks closed on 31 July 2020. Outstanding commitments of loans granted by UBS under the program amounted to CHF 2.2 billion on 31 December 2021, with a total amount drawn of CHF 1.6 billion, compared with the peak commitments of CHF 3.3 billion and the corresponding total amount drawn of CHF 1.7 billion as of 31 July 2020. No net economic profits have been made since the launch of the program in 2020.\n\nIn the US, we continued to support the lending programs created under the CARES Act for small businesses. Working with a  partner,  we  provided  loans  of  USD 1.1  billion  under  the Paycheck Protection Program until the program expired in May 2021. We donated around USD 1 million of fees earned on such loans in 2021 to COVID-19 relief efforts and around USD 2 million in 2020.\n\n## Our support for communities\n\nFollowing  earlier  donations  to  various  COVID-19-related  aid projects that support communities across regions in which we operate,  and  recognizing  the  critical  importance  of  ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines globally, in 2021 UBS partnered with\n\nGavi, the global vaccine alliance, to raise funds for its COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX)  facility. UBS Optimus Foundation raised USD 2 million from clients for the Gavi COVAX facility, which, with matching funds from UBS and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will support COVID-19 vaccinations for  more  than  800,000  people  in  low-  and  middle-income countries.\n\nMore  recently,  we  have  committed  to  a  range  of  relief programs in India through the UBS Optimus Foundation COVID19 Response Fund. Following the first tranche in the second quarter of 2021, which focused on the delivery of oxygen and other medical supplies to those most in need, the current tranche centers  around  building  healthcare  worker  capacity  across underserved and remote locations, as well as supporting the mental health of children and young people to help them cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Our support for employees\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and clients and to adapt our processes related to office work and in-person meetings in line with countryand location-specific developments.\n\nDue to the ongoing pressure placed on employees by closed workplaces and schools, restricted activities and varying degrees of lockdown, we continued with a range of supportive measures throughout 2021. The offer to our employees included a variety of tools and resources to support employees' physical, mental, financial and social well-being, as well as continuing flexibility to manage various work / life demands.\n\n## Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and capital position\n\nThe negative effects of the COVID-19 crisis on our financial and capital positions remained  limited  in  2021,  despite  the uncertainties caused by the pandemic.\n\nWe maintained a strong capital and liquidity position in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Using a holistic, goals-based approach to financial planning, we deliver a personalized wealth management experience and work side by side with clients to help them realize their ambitions. Our client-facing advisors and the global teams supporting them focus on developing long-term client relationships, which often span generations. Clients look to us for expertise in helping them to grow, protect and transfer their wealth, as well as helping them make some of the most important decisions in their lives. From significant liquidity events to professional milestones and personal turning points, we aim to give clients the confidence to move forward and achieve their goals. Through extensive research into clients' preferences and goals, and broader analysis of investor sentiment globally, we constantly evolve our offerings to meet the shifting priorities of today's wealthy clients. This includes investing in digital capabilities and developing products to help clients fund their lifestyles and manage their cash flow, as well as offering guidance on how they can create a lasting and positive impact for their communities and the causes they care about most. We are the  leading  global  wealth  manager  for  clients  interested  in sustainable  investing, 1 with  a  commitment  to  developing solutions that enable clients to align their financial goals and their personal values.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Global Wealth Management' in the 'Our businesses' section of this report for more information about sustainable investment offerings\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking serves a total of approximately 2.6 million individual clients and over 100,000 corporate clients, companies ranging from start-ups to multi-nationals, including specialized entities, such as pension funds and insurers, real estate companies, commodity traders and banks. Our clients include more than 30% of Swiss households, more than 90% of the largest 250 Swiss corporations and more than 50% of midsize to large pension funds in Switzerland. They look for financial advice based on their needs at each stage of their individual or corporate journey. We aim to deliver outstanding advice to all via a multichannel approach. Clients have access to digital banking, a wide network of branches and remote advice. These channels are designed to deliver a superior, convenient client experience with 24/7 availability, security and value for money, resulting in high levels of client satisfaction. Clients are also offered a broad range of products and services in all relevant areas: basic banking, investing, financing (including mortgages), retirement planning, cash management, trade and export finance, global custody, and company succession, among others. Additionally, they have full access to the solutions of the Investment  Bank,  Asset Management and Global Wealth Management.\n\nIn Asset Management, we deliver investment products and services directly to approximately 2,800 clients around the world, including  sovereign  institutions,  central  banks,  supranational corporations, pension funds and insurers, as well as to Global Wealth Management and its clients, wholesale intermediaries and financial institutions. By building long-term, personalized relationships  with  our  clients  and  partners,  underpinned  by disciplined execution, we aim to achieve a deep understanding of their needs and to earn their trust. We combine our global scale with the independent thinking of our distinct investment teams to utilize innovative ideas, drawing on the breadth and depth of our investment capabilities, across traditional and alternative, active and indexed, to deliver the solutions that clients need.\n\nThe  Investment  Bank  provides  corporate,  institutional  and wealth  management  clients  with  expert  advice,  financial solutions, execution and access to the world's capital markets. Our business model is specifically built around our clients and their needs. Corporate clients can access advisory services, debt and equity capital market solutions, and bespoke financing through our  reshaped  Global  Banking  business.  Our  Global  Markets business focuses on helping institutional clients engage with local markets around the world, offering equities and equity-linked products, and foreign exchange, rates and credit products and services.  Our  equities  and  differentiated  content  offering  is underpinned by Investment Bank Research. The differentiated nature of our research provides access to insight-ready data sets for  thousands  of  companies,  and  aims  to  give  clients  an informational  edge.

        "page_content": "We know the security and confidentiality of our clients' data is of utmost importance to them, as it is for UBS. That is why we put the highest priority on having comprehensive measures in place that are designed to ensure that client data confidentiality and integrity are maintained. We continually assess and improve our control environment to mitigate emerging cyber threats and meet expanding legal and regulatory expectations. Investments in our IT platforms preserve and improve our IT security standards, with a focus on giving clients secure access to their data via our digital channels and protecting that data from unauthorized access. Although the level of sophistication and the impact and volume of cyberattacks continue to grow worldwide, we are ever vigilant, maintaining a strong and agile cybersecurity and information security program to mitigate and manage cyber risk by providing robust, consistent, secure and resilient business processes.\n\n## Enhancing the client experience through innovation and digitalization\n\nWe  streamline  and  simplify  interactions  with  clients  through front-to-back digitalization and innovations.\n\nIn Global Wealth Management, we develop and deploy digital tools that enhance the value of human relationships, a factor that differentiates UBS. Clients expect the convenience and speed that technology offers but, simultaneously, they feel that a personal experience  with  advisors  is  more  important  than  ever.  Our advisors use state-of-the-art digital tools to spend more time with clients and better evaluate the full scope of their financial lives. Our clients appreciate digital tools that improve their experience, for example, easy ways to view their portfolios or access research that is tailored to their needs. They also want multiple ways in which to interact with their advisors. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the associated need for physical distancing, has led clients to embrace the use of digital and mobile tools more than ever before. We continue to introduce new and better tools to meet and exceed clients' expectations. For example, our UBS Manage Advanced [My Way] app offers clients in selected markets an ata-glance comprehensive view of their investment portfolio. With access  to  more  than  60  professionally  managed  investment modules  (building  blocks),  it  is  underpinned  by  continuous portfolio monitoring and risk management. The app is interactive; clients can work with their advisors on a tablet to design their own portfolio, easily including elements such as sustainable investing and themes to reflect their individual preferences and priorities. Based on the strong momentum, client demand and inflows, we intend to scale up and further develop UBS Manage Advanced [My  Way] . In  2021,  the Direct  Investment  Insights digital investment service was introduced in Asia and rolled out in Europe and  Switzerland.  This  service  provides  timely,  relevant  and actionable investment insights and ideas from the CIO directly to clients'  mobile  and  desktop  devices,  linking  insights  with execution  in  our  e-banking  and  mobile  app.  In  the  US,  we announced  the  development  of  a  digital-led,  scalable  advice model for affluent clients. As a trusted brand with premium content, we see opportunities to deliver our expertise to a broader set of clients, combining digital experience with human advice. In Switzerland, our UBS Mobile Banking app has been enhanced so clients can now see relevant investment views and access our realtime quote capabilities before logging in. At a broader level, progress continues on our multi-year strategy to serve clients from two platforms: the Wealth Management Americas Platform in the US and the Wealth Management Platform outside the US.\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking continued to develop simple, smart, secure and sustainable solutions in 2021, reflecting our digital transformation progress. In May 2021, we launched a new Remote Sales & Advice (RSA) unit to offer Personal Banking clients more flexibility in the way they bank through extended service times and the option to receive professional advice remotely. The new RSA approach was also successfully piloted for Corporate & Institutional clients. Following the excellent results of the 2020 pilot, we initiated a Switzerland-wide rollout of UBS Multibanking for corporate clients, an offering that integrates third-party banks for full transparency across accounts and convenient payment execution via a single platform. To assist clients throughout the onboarding phase, we established a virtual support team for the multi-banking solution. Moreover, in response to the growing number of client-support requests via UBS channels, email and telephone, we introduced the UBS Conversational Platform , an end-to-end platform enabling clients to get the right answers for their issues quickly without a lot of interaction with call agents or client advisors. To accelerate innovation in the payment business, we announced our UBS Virtual Credit Cards , a new generation of purely digitally available cards that can be used in online shops and receive deposits from TWINT, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay. Since its introduction, more than 30,000 virtual cards have  been  issued.  For  banking  packages,  we  have  launched UBS me to replace the previous pre-defined banking bundles. Clients can now put together their individual package based on their  own  needs  and  preferences,  and  are  only  charged  for solutions they actually need. Our UBS Atrium mortgage platform for  investment  properties  has  been  integrated  into  the key4 brand, creating a true multi-channel and multi-product offering. As a result of the integration, clients can benefit from digital offering  capabilities  of  the  innovative  mortgage  platform  for owner-occupied  residential  property.  In  addition,  the Green Mortgage for income-producing properties is available via key4 and offers a financial advantage on financing to borrowers who hold recognized sustainability certificates. To give clients access to market-leading solutions beyond banking, we have expanded our network of partnerships. We have joined forces with a Swiss fintech start-up to provide corporate clients with extensive cash management  functionalities,  from  automated  generation  of expense  reports  to  validation  of  supplier  invoices.  To  make progress in our journey toward being more agile, we set up a new virtual  organization  as  a  collaboration  between  Personal  & Corporate Banking, Global Wealth Management and the Chief Digital and Information Office: the Agile Delivery Organization . With more than 26 agile end-to-end delivery crews focused on our clients' needs, we are empowering teams, removing silos and evolving  toward  an  integrated  setup  to  deliver  responsive, adaptable and innovative products. With sustainability being a top strategic priority for our business and our client proposition, we have  continuously  expanded  our  sustainability  agenda.  Our platform for volunteer work, UBS Helpetica , has so far received 286 project ideas and published more than 180 projects with over 70 non-profit partners across its focus topics: the environment, social issues, education and entrepreneurship. An example of further progress in our sustainability journey came when the UBS Strategy Funds were repositioned toward UBS Strategy Funds Sustainable in 2021, which led to the transfer of a significant amount of existing custody assets to sustainable solutions.",

        "page_content": "In Asset Management, we are accelerating our investment in digitalization. We have extended our digital client relationship management pilot tools, technologies and data capabilities to enhance the experience of, and service for, our clients, to foster innovation and to support alpha generation. For example, we will soon  launch  a  scalable  platform  to  enable  more  efficient development  and  management  of  theme-based  investment products to meet growing client demand. We continue to expand the suite of tools used by our Quantitative Evidence & Data Science  team,  who  utilize  alternative  and  traditional  data combined with statistical modeling to enhance and augment our fundamental and systematic investment processes. To simplify and enhance our client servicing, we  are introducing improvements in client and data analytics.\n\nThe Investment Bank strives to be the digital investment bank of the future, with innovation-led businesses driving efficiencies and solutions. In February 2021, we announced the creation of a Digital  Platforms function  within  the  Investment  Bank  across Global Markets and Global Banking, to work on exponential transformation through experimentation, innovation, and external partnerships. The Digital Platforms function is critical to delivering  on  our  client  promise.  In  Global  Markets,  our Technology-Enhanced Sales (TES) teams work in close partnership with  our  Data  Intelligence,  Group  Technology,  and  Client Coverage teams to embed our data and technology capabilities across all client teams and enhance our client service. TES allows clients to choose where and how we deliver content and uses data modeling to customize the content they receive. UBS Neo , our award-winning multi-channel platform and enterprise ecosystem for digital clients, lets our professional and institutional clients access a comprehensive suite of products and services covering the full investment life cycle. Historically, most clients used only one or two of the capabilities available to them via UBS Neo . We have  now  transformed  the  client  experience  through  a  new personalized version of the platform, including the launch of an app  store. Investment  Bank  DigiOps , our  Operations  team working  in  collaboration  with  Group  Technology  on  digital innovation projects, is enhancing the client experience through a digital platform that continues to make progress on simplifying Operation's technology infrastructure, increasing front-to-back efficiency and enhancing our decision making and relevance to clients. New non-bank competitors have secured a foothold in our markets, while fintech firms have carved out and dominated entirely new segments. In response, we created a team focused on  strategic  investments  and  fundamentally  new  market infrastructure. By utilizing distributed ledger technology, Global Markets is transforming the business models of products where the Investment Bank has been strong historically. One example is UBS Gold , our global physical gold transaction network of retail investors,  gold  merchants,  institutional  investors  and  vault providers that enables clients to buy and sell at interbank prices.\n\nA tokenized representation of underlying physical gold provides fractional ownership with low-friction transactional capability. Our vision is to accelerate the tokenization of financial products traded by UBS clients. In November 2021, the Investment Bank helped  SIX  Group  to  launch  the  first  ever  Swiss  francdenominated digital bond offering, which is listed, traded and settled on the newly established SIX Digital Exchange. Global Banking has also prioritized the client experience. Global Banking Data & Analytics Lab uses data science, predictive analytics and quantitative models to develop solutions for our businesses. UBSGUARD applies data science and predictive analytics to Global Banking  business  users,  predicting  the  risk  of  companies becoming the targets of activists, identifying deal opportunities and helping navigate client pitches. Our SPAC database is a fully automated  database  of  in-market  special  purpose  acquisition companies  (SPACs)  created  to  match  SPACs  with  potential acquisition targets and help increase efficiency and collaboration across sectors and regions.\n\n## Engaging with our clients\n\nWe use a variety of channels to engage with clients, including regular client relationship and service meetings, as well as various corporate roadshows and dedicated events. Digital interaction with clients increased as the pandemic continued.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management interacted with clients via various settings in 2021, from personalized private briefings with subject matter experts to segment-specific virtual events and large-scale initiatives. We utilize marketing campaigns, events, advertising, publications  and  digital-only  solutions  to  help  drive  greater awareness of UBS among prospective clients and reinforce trustbased relationships between advisors and clients.\n\nPersonal  &  Corporate  Banking  holds  regular  client  events (mostly webcasts and virtual or hybrid events since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), covering a wide range of topics. In 2021, we increasingly engaged with clients via online channels, such as social media, online displays and search engines, and further decreased our use of traditional out-of-home channels.\n\nIn Asset Management, we have a consistent program of client events  and  engagement  activities  throughout  the  year.  This includes our flagship conferences, such as the annual UBS Reserve Management Seminar, and we held our inaugural Alternatives Conference in 2021. Alongside this, our teams continued the high level of interaction with clients globally in 2021, facilitated by new digital tools, and our publication of macro insights and thought leadership to provide timely insights into rapidly evolving markets. We also hosted a broad range of virtual events, including our Nobel  Perspectives webinar  series,  to  help  our  clients  better understand market challenges and investment opportunities, and we continued to engage with clients through our social media and online channels.",

        "page_content": "The Investment Bank hosted over 170 investor conferences and educational seminars globally in 2021, covering a broad range of macro, sector, regional and regulatory topics. Almost all of those conferences were held virtually. More than 40,000 clients took part in such events in 2021, providing insight and access to our own opinion leaders, policymakers and leading industry experts. We leverage our intellectual capital and relationships and use our execution capabilities, differentiated research content, bespoke solutions, client franchise model and global platform to expand coverage across a broad set of clients. UBS Neo Question Bank is the largest global database of market-related questions asked by professional  investors,  while UBS  Live  Desk, built  within  the UBS Neo platform, provides clients with a stream of fast-paced commentary from UBS traders.\n\n## How we measure client satisfaction\n\nWe use multiple techniques to regularly assess our achievements and the satisfaction of our clients.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management is increasingly using technology and  analytics  capabilities  to  collect  and  respond  to  client feedback. Our digital client feedback tool lets clients submit, via mobile and the web, input about overall satisfaction with advisors and UBS, and share key topics they wish to discuss with their advisors. Advisors and their teams have seamless, real-time access to client feedback, enabling them to be highly responsive. The tool is available in the US and Asia Pacific, as well as most EMEA countries.\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking has conducted annual surveys of clients in Switzerland since 2008, consistently covering all private and corporate client segments annually since 2015. Clients provide feedback on their satisfaction with regard to various topics (e.g., UBS overall, branches, client advisors, products and services) and indicate further product or advisory needs. Survey responses are distributed to client advisors, who follow up with each respondent individually. In 2021, we had an all-time high client satisfaction and net promoter score (NPS), and achieved a 77% follow-up rate with survey participants.\n\nThe Quality Feedback system in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking provides a comprehensive and systematic platform to receive and process client feedback and suggestions. We receive feedback in various forms and through different channels, including in writing, electronically, orally to client advisors and staff in our branches and other client touch points, via social media channels, and via the Swiss Banking Ombudsman.  Client  feedback, including complaints and suggestions, is vitally important, as it shows direct and unfiltered client needs, supports the development and introduction of new products and services and hence fosters the optimization of our offering  in  a  client-focused  manner.  By  addressing  client feedback, we aim to strengthen client relationships, improve\n\nclient  satisfaction  and  make  tangible  improvements  to  our services.  By  sharing  their  views,  clients  contribute  to  quality improvements at all levels. We aim to respond to each individual who provides feedback. In 2021, key topics and enhancements centered mostly around digital banking functionalities, digital client onboarding and the reorganization of UBS's branches and services.\n\nIn Asset Management, we have an integrated process to record and  manage  client  feedback  through  our  client  relationship management tool. We also conduct regular surveys, covering our wholesale and institutional clients globally, inviting them to assess their satisfaction with our client service, products and solutions, as well as other factors relevant to their investments. The results are analyzed to identify focus areas for improvement and our client  relationship  managers  follow  up  with  respondents  to address specific feedback where required.\n\nThe Investment Bank closely monitors client satisfaction via individual  product  coverage  points.  Direct  client  feedback  is actively captured and tracked in our systems. Internal regional forums serve as a platform for senior management to discuss client  relationships,  possibilities  for  improvement,  potential opportunities and specific client issues. Other processes are in place to enable consolidated findings to be shared within UBS as appropriate. The Investment Bank also closely monitors external surveys, which provide feedback across a range of investment banking services. We continue to make progress in simplifying our technology infrastructure, focusing on increasing front-to-back efficiency and enhancing our decision making and relevance to clients. In November 2021, we launched the first Annual Global Markets Client Survey to gauge our clients' experience of UBS and the products and services that are important to them, measuring client  satisfaction  and  loyalty.  In  2021,  over  49%  of  Global Markets clients surveyed expected to increase their market share with  UBS  in  the  next  six  months.  When  ranking  the  most important  factor  in  choosing  a  market  partner,  relationship management coverage and connectivity were a priority, further underlining the importance of our people. When asked about future capabilities, our clients ranked highly the need for profiled personalization  of  products  and  services,  underlining  the importance of our Digital Platforms and our TES initiative.\n\nWe thoroughly evaluate the feedback we receive, including complaints from clients, and take measures to address key themes identified. For example, in 2021, Personal & Corporate Banking clients expressed an increasing need for security and trust. The ongoing optimization and digitalization of products has been well received  by  clients  across  all  segments.  However,  in  light  of ongoing branch closures, clients would like further digitalization. Furthermore,  feedback  indicated  that  clients  developed  high levels of acceptance for telephone or video advice and were increasingly satisfied with the service received via Global Banking.",

Across the firm, we intend to maintain our risk and cost discipline to support our growth plans, with continual enhancement of dayto-day efforts.\n\nWe are aiming to create sustainable value through the cycle. To accomplish this, we have outlined selected commercial and environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspirations, which should support our financial targets.\n\nOur primary measurement of performance for the Group is return on common equity tier 1 (CET1), as regulatory capital is our binding  constraint  and  drives  our  ability  to  return  capital  to shareholders.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Targets, aspirations and capital guidance' section of this report for more information\n\n## Active capital management to enable growth and deliver attractive shareholder returns\n\nOur first priority is ensuring that we can maintain a strong balance sheet. This includes our strong capitalization, in line with our capital guidance of maintaining a CET1 capital ratio of around 13% and a CET1 capital leverage ratio of greater than 3.7%.\n\nAs a second priority, we consider opportunities for investment in growth.\n\nOur third priority is returning capital to shareholders in the form  of  dividends,  and  we  intend  to  pay  progressive  cash dividends. For 2021, the Board of Directors intends to propose a dividend to UBS Group AG shareholders of USD 0.50 per share.\n\nAfter  these  three  priorities  have  been  met,  we  intend  to distribute excess capital to shareholders via share buybacks.

In 2021, we updated our House View on Leadership to reflect the behavior that we expect every leader to demonstrate toward employees, clients  and  business  activities.  Leaders  at  all  levels  are  also expected to foster simplification, empowerment and accountability in their teams to support our ongoing transformation.\n\nKey to maintaining a strong culture are listening to employees and acting on their feedback. Launched in mid-2021, our new employee-listening strategy uses Group-wide surveys conducted by  an  external  provider  to  measure  indicators  such  as  line manager effectiveness, and in-depth research to solve specific business issues. As an example, an Organizational Health Index assesses  firm-wide  alignment  with  strategic  goals,  working practices and adaptability.

Participants' experiences, along with coaching and specialized training delivered through the Agile Academy  within  our  UBS  University,  will  enable  us  to systematically roll out Agile@UBS to more business areas going forward.\n\n## Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I)\n\nIn our experience, diverse teams better understand and relate to our  equally  diverse  clients  and  their  needs.  Furthermore, employees  with  different  backgrounds  and  experiences  drive innovation and better decision making. Our aim, therefore, is to shape a diverse and inclusive organization that is innovative, provides outstanding service to our clients and offers equitable opportunities so that all employees may thrive.\n\nOur  broad  approach  encompasses  a  range  of  aspects, including inclusive leadership, gender, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and disability. Along with a concerted focus on building inclusive leadership  skills,  increasing  gender  and  ethnic  diversity,  and ensuring equitable policies and practices were priorities in 2021. Regarding gender, we aspire to have 30% of Director and above roles held by women by 2025. At the end of 2021, that figure stood at 26.7%, up from 26.0% in 2020. Similarly, our 2025 aspiration is to achieve a 26% representation of ethnic minorities at Director level and above in the UK and the US. As of the end of 2021, this figure was 20.1% in the US and 21.3% in the UK.\n\nInitially launched in Switzerland in 2016, our global UBS Career Comeback program continues to help us increase our pipeline of female leaders. To date, the program has helped 196 women and 19 men relaunch their careers.\n\nIn  addition  to  strategic  initiatives,  each  year  we  sponsor numerous  activities  to  promote  inclusivity  and  a  culture  of belonging. Chief among them are activities provided by our 48 employee networks across the firm. Employee volunteers regularly host educational events and initiatives focused on gender, culture, ethnicity, LGBTQ+ / Pride, disability, veterans, parenting, elder care and other topics. Our employee networks also raise the visibility of employees' needs and help shape our DE&I program, local benefits offerings, and more. Disability is a key focus area: as such, the firm became a member of The Valuable 500 in 2021, committing to make disability inclusion part of the firm's business leadership agenda.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/diversity for more information about our DE&I priorities, commitments and progress\n\n## Personnel by region\n\n|                                                        | As of             | As of    | As of    | % change from   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|----------|-----------------|\n| Full-time equivalents                                  | 3 311..1122..2211 | 31.12.20 | 31.12.19 | 31.12.20        |\n| Americas                                               | 2 211,,331177     | 21,394   | 21,036   | 0               |\n| of which: USA                                          | 2 200,,553377     | 20,528   | 20,232   | 0               |\n| Asia Pacific                                           | 1 155,,661188     | 15,353   | 13,956   | 2               |\n| Europe, Middle East and Africa (excluding Switzerland) | 1 144,,009911     | 13,899   | 12,918   | 1               |\n| of which: UK                                           | 6 6,,005511       | 6,069    | 5,704    | 0               |\n| of which: rest of Europe (excluding Switzerland)       | 7 7,,882266       | 7,652    | 7,048    | 2               |\n| of which: Middle East and Africa                       | 2 21155           | 178      | 166      | 21              |\n| Switzerland                                            | 2 200,,335599     | 20,904   | 20,691   | (3)             |\n| T Toottaall                                            | 7 711,,338855     | 71,551   | 68,601   | 0               |",

        "page_content": "## Practices that help us remain an employer of choice\n\nCompensating employees fairly and consistently is key to ensuring equal opportunities. We pay for performance, and we take pay equity seriously. A strong commitment to both is embedded in our compensation policies, and we conduct both internal reviews and independent external audits as quality checks. If we uncover gaps that cannot be explained by business factors or appropriate personal  factors  -  such  as  experience,  role,  responsibility, performance or location - we explore the root causes of those gaps and address them. Additionally, our regular monitoring and review processes also allow us to maintain our certification status with the EQUALSALARY Foundation for our equal pay practices in Switzerland, the US, the UK, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore. The firm  also  successfully  completed  an  equal  pay  analysis  in Switzerland in 2020, as required by the Swiss Federal Act on Gender Equality. The results of the analysis confirmed that we are fully compliant with Swiss equal pay standards. These holistic certifications  are  a  testament  to  our  well-established  equal opportunity  environment  and  the  strength  of  our  human resources practices, including performance and reward. In 2021, we  continued  to  monitor  pay  fairness  and  addressed  any unexplained gaps to ensure that all employees are paid fairly. All employees  have  access  to  competitive  benefits,  including insurance, retirement and personal leave.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Compensation' section of this report for more information about compensation-related topics\n\n## Meeting employees' needs while improving services for clients\n\nWorking both from home and from the office became the norm for  many  employees  in  2021,  with  surveys  indicating  strong support for continued flexibility. Following a global analysis that considered factors such as regulation, risk and productivity, we determined that approximately 75% of our employees could be eligible to work in a hybrid setup. In addition to fostering better work / life balance, a hybrid model makes us a more attractive employer to a wider pool of applicants, such as early-career talent, working parents and those in continuing education. The emphasis on technology and virtual collaboration also sparks innovative thinking that will make us more agile and further improve client service. We are implementing hybrid working on a country-bycountry basis, along with wide-ranging support to ensure that employees, teams and our culture all continue to thrive.\n\n## Health and well-being\n\nSupporting employee health and well-being remained a priority in 2021. We are committed to helping employees thrive in their current  roles  and  deliver  sustainable  performance  over  time. Regular 'pulse' surveys gauged employees' views on remote work, stress, communication and other aspects. Resources to help employees  support  holistic  well-being  featured  a  bespoke eLearning  curriculum,  physical  and  mental  health  initiatives, volunteering opportunities, increased benefits offerings in certain locations, and financial education.\n\n## Employee representation\n\nWe  maintain  an  open  dialogue  with  our  formal  employee representation groups, all of which are in Europe, as part of our commitment  to  being  a  responsible  employer.  These  groups represent 17 countries and consider issues that may affect our performance, operations and prospects. Collectively, these groups represent approximately 49% of our global workforce.\n\n## Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent\n\nFostering an agile and connected workforce is a priority for the near term. We therefore need to have processes in place that are designed to ensure that we have the best people, in the right roles, at  the  right  time,  to  achieve  our  strategic  goals. Comprehensive workforce data dashboards help us analyze all aspects  of  the  employee  life  cycle,  including  recruitment, performance  management,  training,  internal  mobility  and attrition, along with demographic and diversity aspects, such as gender and ethnicity. This helps us identify trends quickly and make fact-based decisions grounded in human resources data.\n\nThroughout 2021, we hired new talent where necessary to launch or expand businesses and to fill gaps in our workforce. We recruit for potential and cultural fit, hiring beyond immediately relevant skills to include the person's experience, competencies and digital aptitude. We hired a total of 9,363 external candidates in 2021, adding more than 1,700 graduates and other trainees, apprentices  and  interns  through  our  various  junior  talent programs. We invest in young talent in every region, supporting national apprenticeship programs in Switzerland and the UK and summer internship programs in many locations. In Singapore, UBS worked with the government to set up a program to support ongoing employability during the pandemic and to increase the resilience of regional banking infrastructure. Our approach has garnered numerous external accolades in 2021, including a top50  ranking  in  the  World's  Most  Attractive  Employers  from employer-branding experts Universum, for the 13th consecutive year.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/employerawards for more information about our most recent employer rewards\n\n## Focusing on performance and development\n\nResetting the firm's strategic course sparked a comprehensive review of our performance management practices in 2021. As a result, we introduced a new approach called MyImpact that aims to better support our strategic priorities and reinforce our culture, as well as making our year-end review, objective setting and employee feedback processes simpler and more transparent.\n\nKey to our talent management strategy is offering employees opportunities to build interesting careers. Our innovative digital Career  Navigator platform,  which  now  features  short-term rotation opportunities, promotes internal mobility across teams, functions and business divisions. Employees can explore career paths, search for jobs and connect with colleagues while allowing our recruiters to more easily source internal talent. The tool also identifies potential competency gaps and automatically recommends  appropriate  training.  Since  inception, Career Navigator has helped 47,600 employees search for short-term job opportunities or find internal experts, discover possible career paths and match themselves to open roles. More than 160,000 skills were added to our employee skills-sharing platform in 2021.\n\nOur in-house UBS University plays a central role in fostering diversity of thought within the firm, and in building employees' skills for use now along with capabilities for the future. Our offering  includes  line  manager  and  leadership  development, advisory and sales training, and industry-leading certification for client advisors, as well as data literacy, agile working and health and  well-being  topics.  Altogether  in  2021,  our  permanent employees completed more than 1,425,000 learning activities, including mandatory training on compliance, business and other topics, resulting in an average of more than two training days per employee.",

        "page_content": "## Society\n\nThe world's social and environmental problems are too big and complex to tackle alone. Lasting change can only be achieved when philanthropists and public and private organizations work collectively to maximize positive impact for people and the planet.\n\nOur clients can maximize the positive effect of their giving through  our  diverse  social  impact  offering:  UBS  Philanthropy Services and the grant-making UBS Optimus Foundation, as well as UBS Global Visionaries and UBS Community Impact.\n\n## Reimagining client philanthropy\n\nWith nearly 70 philanthropy experts around the globe, we help clients to maximize their impact locally, nationally and globally. We have partnered for more than two decades with clients and their  families  by  using  an  investment-based  approach  and connecting them to an international network of expertise and support.\n\nTo best serve our clients, we base our approach on three pillars: Advice, Insights and Execution. Advice - consulting with clients who are considering setting up their first charitable fund and guiding them on tax-efficient giving, thus maximizing the value of charitable giving. Insights - connecting our clients to a global network of experts, both within and outside UBS (e.g., through insight  trips,  publications,  events  with  fellow  philanthropists, thought leaders and social entrepreneurs, such as UBS Global Visionaries). Execution - providing clients with flexible options for managing their philanthropic giving, including structures such as our donor-advised funds (DAFs) and our new UBS Collectives , and supporting curated programs via UBS Optimus Foundation.\n\n## Donor-advised funds\n\nA DAF offers clients an easy, flexible and efficient alternative to setting up their own foundation. UBS has offered DAF services in the US for some time, and in 2014 we established a DAF in the UK, which has since had over GBP 450 million in donations. The UBS Philanthropy Foundation was launched in Switzerland in 2020: it has raised more than USD 10 million in donations and in its first year of operations launched its first thematic fund, which is dedicated to the environment.\n\n## UBS Optimus Foundation\n\nWith  a  track  record  of  over  two  decades,  UBS  Optimus Foundation is recognized globally as both a philanthropic thought leader and a pioneer in the social finance space, through which we leverage solutions to mobilize private capital in new and more efficient ways. The foundation uses an evidence-based approach and  focuses  on  programs  that  have  the  potential  to  be transformative, scalable and sustainable. It conducts extensive due diligence and only recommends what it considers to be the most innovative programs that have the capacity to achieve longterm, measurable impact. UBS also makes matching contributions to the foundation, to help our clients' donations go even further.\n\nThe UBS Collectives also utilize an evidence-based approach and bring together philanthropists to pool their funds, share their expertise and achieve a longer-term impact. The Collectives are a three-year learning journey during which philanthropists follow a curriculum, network with peers and engage in programs with the goals of preventing family separation, mitigating climate change\n\nand funding programs linked to measurable results. In 2021, USD 21 million in funding was raised for this long-term systemslevel change approach.\n\n## UBS Global Visionaries\n\nThe  private  sector  has  a  crucial  role  to  play  in  supporting innovative, sustainable solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems. This is why we launched the UBS Global Visionaries program in 2016 with two main goals: (i) to create opportunities for our clients and prospective clients to connect in person (or virtually) with leading social entrepreneurs; and (ii) to help our UBS Global Visionaries scale their positive change by expanding their global network, building capacity and raising awareness about their work. Since the program started, we have supported  63  entrepreneurs  across  the  globe,  who  all  work toward achieving a variety of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. At the end of 2021, 20 of those entrepreneurs were engaged in the program as active Global Visionaries, more than 60 prospective clients and clients had been directly connected with them, and 80 events hosted by UBS at which they were featured speakers. Over 29,000 stakeholders (such as prospective clients,  clients  and  employees)  participated  in  these  events. Feedback from our clients shows this gives them new ways to engage  in  their  passions  and  learn  about  new  topics  or technologies. In return, our UBS Global Visionaries benefit from clients sharing their skills, experience and contacts.\n\n## UBS Community Impact\n\nWe are committed to supporting the communities in which we work. Our employees, clients and shareholders expect us to play our part in addressing social issues - and we believe it is the right thing to do. Direct cash contributions, including support through our Community Impact program, UBS's affiliated foundations in Switzerland, the UBS Foundation of Economics in Society at the University of Zurich and  contributions to UBS  Optimus Foundation, amounted to a total of USD 59 million in 2021. During  2021,  we  focused  on  addressing  social  and  wealth inequality in our local communities through education and skill building. Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic in 2021, we continued to provide some COVID-19 relief to support the most vulnerable, as well as supporting recovery and rebuilding efforts through our community partners.\n\nFollowing the announcement of UBS's purpose in April 2021, we undertook a review of our global Community Impact strategy in light of UBS's new sustainability commitment. We will increase our focus on education and skills with the implementation of our revised strategy in 2022.\n\nUBS's overall charitable contributions are measured using the industry-leading Business Investment for Societal Impact framework (B4SI). This includes cash, employee time, and in-kind support.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS's charitable contributions' in the 'What' section of the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information",

At UBS, we reimagine the power of people and investment, to help create a better world for everyone: a fairer society, a more prosperous economy and a healthier environment. That is why we partner with our clients to help them mobilize their capital toward a more sustainable world and why we have put sustainability at the heart of our own business.\n\nWe are guided by the goal of being the financial provider of choice  for  clients  that  want  to  mobilize  capital  toward  the achievement of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs) of the United Nations (the UN) and the orderly transition to a lowcarbon economy. We are advancing toward 2030, the designated deadline to achieve the SDGs. The SDGs focus on issues such as climate change, equality and healthcare - major challenges for our world now and over the coming years.\n\nTo help us maximize our impact and direct capital to where it is needed most, we are focusing on three key areas to drive the sustainability transition: planet, people, partnerships.\n\n- -Planet: Climate is a clear focus for us as we shift toward a lower-carbon future. We have committed to achieving netzero greenhouse gas emissions resulting from all aspects of our business by 2050.\n- -People: We believe in a diverse, equitable and inclusive society. We are taking action to get there, within our own workplace and beyond.\n- -Partnerships: By working in partnership with other thought leaders and standard setters, our goal is to achieve impact on a truly global scale.\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about how UBS is advancing sustainability in the financial sector and beyond\n\n## Our sustainability and impact governance\n\nSustainability activities, including sustainable finance, are overseen at the highest level of UBS, by the Board of Directors (the BoD) and the Group Executive Board (the GEB), and are grounded in our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the Code).\n\n## Code of Conduct and Ethics\n\nIn our Code of Conduct and Ethics, the BoD and the GEB set out the principles and practices that define our ethical standards and the  way  we  do  business,  which  apply  to  all  aspects  of  our business. All employees must affirm annually that they have read and will adhere to the Code and other key policies, supporting a culture where ethical and responsible behavior is part of our everyday operations. In our Code we make a commitment to acting with the long term in mind and creating value for clients, employees and shareholders. We aspire to do our part to create a\n\nfairer, more  prosperous  society,  championing  a  healthier environment and addressing inequalities at their root. This ethos underpins  our  purpose  and  is  in  line  with  our  external commitments,  such  as  our  pledge  to  help  making  progress toward the SDGs.\n\nIn  2021,  we  revised  the  Code  in  line  with  our  focus  on simplification, making it shorter, sharper and better aligned to our strategic imperatives.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Code of Conduct and Ethics of UBS, available at ubs.com/code , for more information\n\n## Board of Directors and Group Executive Board\n\nThe BoD is responsible for setting UBS's values and standards to ensure the Group's obligations to stakeholders are met. Both the Chairman of the BoD and the Group CEO play a key role in safeguarding  our  reputation  and  ensuring  we  communicate effectively with all of our stakeholders.\n\nThe BoD's Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) is the UBS body primarily responsible for corporate culture, responsibility and sustainability. The CCRC oversees our sustainability and impact strategy and activities and approves Group-wide sustainability and impact objectives. The Group CEO has delegated to the GEB lead for sustainability and impact, Suni Harford, the responsibility for setting the firm's sustainability and impact strategy, in agreement with fellow GEB members.\n\nThe GEB sets the overall risk appetite for the firm and resolves overarching matters relating to sustainability and climate risks, including risk management framework, policies, and disclosure. Group  Risk  Control  is  responsible  for  the  development  and implementation of principles and an appropriate independent control framework for sustainability and climate risks within UBS, and the integration of the principles and the framework into the firm's overall risk management and risk appetite frameworks.\n\n## Group Sustainability and Impact\n\nThe  Group  Sustainability  and  Impact  (GSI)  organization  was created in 2021 to support the GEB lead for sustainability and impact with carrying out her responsibilities. GSI comprises the Chief Sustainability and Social Impact offices, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer (the CSO) and the Head Social Impact. The CSO is responsible for driving the implementation of the Groupwide sustainability and impact strategy, including reporting on our progress toward net zero, and the execution thereof by the business divisions and Group Functions. The Head Social Impact is responsible  for  driving  and  implementing  our  social  impact strategy, including UBS Community Impact, UBS Philanthropy Services and UBS Global Visionaries. Progress toward the firm's sustainability and impact strategy, including climate strategy, and associated targets is reviewed at least annually by the GEB and the CCRC.",

We recognize this as both a challenge for society and an opportunity for our clients. As a global financial institution, we have a role in reaching the SDGs, by directing capital to where it is needed the most.\n\nOur clients turn to us for advice on how they can help to finance  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  support sustainable finance, align their investments with their personal values, and better risk manage their portfolios and businesses. They want to take advantage of these opportunities, while also managing  the  risks  associated  with  this  transformational challenge.\n\nOur clients' growing interest in sustainable finance is clearly shown in a number of key surveys. According to a global UBS Investor  Sentiment  survey, 2 66%  of  investors  see  sustainable investing as highly important to their portfolio strategy. When it comes  to  business  owners,  61%  believe  sustainability  could\n\ngenerate more revenue, 57% believe it could improve client relationships  and  55%  believe  it  could  do  the  same  for relationships with employees.\n\nA global survey published in 2021 titled 'Resetting the agenda How ESG is shaping our future' 3 found that three-quarters of institutional investors agree that the COVID-19 pandemic will accelerate the general interest in ESG and capital inflows into sustainable investments over the next three to five years. Of those surveyed, 65% plan to integrate ESG into at least 25% of their assets under management for the next 12 months. Importantly, almost  three-quarters  of  survey  respondents  agreed  that investments integrating ESG factors performed better financially than equivalent traditional investments in the three years prior to 2020.\n\nWe are committed to serving our clients' growing sustainable finance needs and expectations. More fundamentally, we believe sustainable finance is the future of finance. Recognition of impact on  financial  performance,  regulatory  developments,  evolving societal norms, investor demand and consumer preference are factors  that  contribute  to  drive  the  continued  evolution  of mainstream investing toward more holistic long-term-oriented approaches.\n\nWe are looking to create more scalable sustainable and impact investing solutions that deliver competitive financial returns, and to advise our corporate clients on risks to their business models, while driving positive outcomes. Fundamentally, for the benefit of our clients, we are helping to shape the landscape of sustainable finance by using thought leadership, innovation and partnerships to support them in their sustainability efforts.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about our sustainability and impact strategy and activities\n- \u203a Refer to the sub-section below for more information about our climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets and to the UBS Climate Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for the full UBS climate disclosures\n\n## Defining sustainable finance\n\nSustainable finance refers broadly to any form of financial service that aims to achieve positive sustainability outcomes, including through the integration of ESG criteria into business or investment decisions. This encompasses sustainable investing and sustainable financing solutions. Sustainable finance has long been a topic firm-wide and there is now a sharpened understanding in the market of its importance, accelerated by factors such as the COVID-19  pandemic  and  a  changing  climate.  Our  aim  is  to continue to help our clients meet their investment and financing objectives through sustainable finance.",

SI strategies aim to better risk manage portfolios in line with 21st-century challenges and / or to align investments with investors'  sustainability  values,  while  also  targeting  improved portfolio risk and return characteristics.\n\nWe have long recognized that clients and other stakeholders need  transparency  about  the  sustainability  objectives  of  our various investment products. During 2021, the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (the SFDR) provided the first formal, comprehensive legislative framework establishing an important  marker  for  the  industry's  efforts  in  this  area. Consequently, we have further evolved our own definitions of SI, which now include the following two categories.\n\n- -Sustainability focus: strategies that have explicit sustainable intentions or objectives that drive the strategy. Underlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products / services / use of proceeds.\n- -Impact investing: investment strategies that have an explicit intention of generating  measurable,  verifiable,  positive sustainability outcomes. Impact generated is attributable to investor action and / or contribution.\n\n## ESG integration and exclusion\n\nWe also identify two approaches that consider ESG factors in the investment process to varying degrees, but which on their own are not considered sustainable investment.\n\n- -ESG integration : considers ESG factors alongside traditional financial  metrics  to  assess  the  risk-return  profile  in  the investment  process.  This  approach  is  rapidly  becoming  an industry standard, as the inclusion of such factors has been shown to benefit overall investment risk-return considerations.\n- -Exclusion : when individual companies or entire industries are excluded from portfolios because their activities do not meet certain ESG criteria and / or do not align with the values of clients and / or UBS.\n\n## Investment approaches\n\n## UBS's defi nition of sustainable investments\n\n## Sustainability focus\n\n- - Target market-rate investment returns\n- - Have explicit sustainable intentions or objectives that drive the strategy\n- - Underlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products, services and / or proceeds\n\n## Impact investing\n\n- - Target market-rate investment returns\n- - Have explicit intentions to generate measurable, verifi able, positive sustainability outcomes\n- - Impact attributable to investor action and / or contribution\n\n## Sustainable financing\n\nWe  offer  products  and  solutions,  including  access  to  capital markets, to clients looking to finance assets that demonstrate sustainability characteristics and / or support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Financing activities can be on-balance sheet (such as loans and mortgages) or off-balance sheet (such as access to debt and equity markets). We also provide advice on ESG factors  (both  financial  and  non-financial),  such  as  integrated disclosure requirements.\n\nWe use regulatory and market standards where these are available; for example, in the debt capital markets business, we refer  to  the  International  Capital  Market  Association  (ICMA) Green, Social or Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles. Where such guidelines or standards are not available, we aim to align with market best practice. This is the case, for example, with equity capital markets activities.\n\nOur established sustainability and climate risk (SCR, previously known at UBS as environmental and social risk, or ESR) framework is used to analyze potential transactions and client relationships in order  to  limit  any  negative  impact  on  the  environment  and society. Moreover, as one of the world's largest asset gathering businesses,  we  are  in  a  privileged  position  to  leverage  the experience gained from  our  Climate  Aware  framework, established in 2019 by our Asset Management business, to the benefit of our financing clients.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Key achievements in 2021' chart in the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under\n\n'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors\n\nIn  2021,  we  noted  continued  strong  momentum  in  our sustainable finance activities. SI assets grew to USD 251 billion, compared with USD 141 billion in 2020, and assets subject to ESG integration and to exclusions grew to USD 813 billion in 2021, compared with USD 645 billion in 2020. Jointly, SI assets and assets subject to ESG integration and to exclusions reached over 23% of client invested assets, up from 18.8% in 2020. In addition to generally supportive markets, the growth was driven by client demand,  our  focus  on  advancing  sustainable  solutions,  and converting traditional funds to sustainable ones.\n\n## 'Traditional' investing\n\n- - No explicit sustainability objectives\n- - Manage sustainability and all risks related to investment performance\n- - May use ESG tools, but these do not drive the strategy",

ESG integration and exclusion approaches, although considering ESG aspects in the investment process, are in and of themselves not considered sustainable investment strategies. 2 2 FS represents the performance indicators defined in the Financial Services Sector Supplement of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting framework. 3 3 Strategies that have explicit sustainable intentions or objectives that drive the strategy. Underlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products / services / use of proceeds. Examples include Global Wealth Management's Discretionary Manage SI mandate solution and Asset Management's strategies such as its Global Sustainable Equities product. 4 4 Strategies that have explicit intentions of generating measurable, verifiable and positive sustainability outcomes. Impact generated is attributable to investor action and / or contributions. Examples include Global Wealth Management's Oncology Impact funds and Asset Management's Global Engage for Impact Equity funds. 5 5 In 2021, UBS converted funds to the sustainability focus and impact investment categories, in line with corresponding changes to the funds' underlying investment policies. The main impact was on sustainability focus and impact strategies in Asset Management of USD 38 billion and sustainability focus fund conversions in Global Wealth Management. 6 6 Strategies that integrate ESG factors into the fundamental financial analysis to improve risk / return. 7 7 Strategies that avoid investments in companies that do not meet certain ESG criteria and / or do not align with the values of clients and / or UBS. The enhancement of the UBS ESG exclusion policy to include a broader set of exclusions in the third quarter of 2021 was the main driver (>50%) of the increase in exclusion assets in 2021.\n\n## Our offering to clients\n\nOur  private  clients  benefit  from  fully  diversified  sustainable portfolios,  as  well  as  advisory  options.  In  2020,  we  made sustainable investments the preferred solution for private clients investing globally. In July 2021, we expanded our sustainable investing  offering  with  a  new  advisory  solution  that  enables clients to tailor their sustainable investments to their personal preferences. In 2021, our flagship SI mandates, based on our sustainable investing strategic asset allocation (SI SAA), exceeded USD 30 billion under management.\n\nOur institutional clients benefit from the holistic integration of ESG factors into the investment decision-making process across the entire suite of investment funds and strategies. Underpinning our ESG integration activities is a robust stewardship program, including engagement and proxy voting. We have continued to build  on  our  position  as  a  leading  provider  of  sustainable exchange-traded funds (ETFs), launching 17 new sustainable ETFs in 2021, including a full suite of benchmarks aligned with the Paris Agreement. We remain firmly positioned as Europe's secondlargest sustainable ETF-provider, with an SI asset base of USD 40 billion as of 31 December 2021.\n\nOur retail clients in Switzerland have access to appropriate and relevant SI products. Interest in SI solutions continued to be strong in  2021. UBS  ManageTM  SI ,  a  Global  Wealth  Management product, represented almost 70% of Personal Banking's mandate sales. In addition, 47% of total custody assets in Personal Banking are composed of sustainable investments.\n\nFor our Swiss corporate and institutional clients, supplier and producer transactions in commodity trade finance are monitored according to our SCR standards. Furthermore, our sustainable finance  advice  extends  to  strategic  positioning  of  business models, disclosure practices and benchmarking.\n\nOur corporate clients benefit from a range of financing and advisory solutions at all stages on their sustainability journey. In 2021, Global Banking, within our Investment Bank, set up an ESG Advisory team to assist established corporate clients with the integration of ESG risks and opportunities into their decisions related to strategy, operations and financing, thereby supporting their positioning in the financial markets. They also help young ESG-driven companies with the raising of private and / or public financing.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about our sustainable investing and financing offering, including financing solutions, advisory and research and insights\n\n## Managing sustainability and climate risks\n\nAt UBS, SCR is defined as the risk that UBS is negatively impacted by or negatively impacts climate change, loss of biodiversity, human rights infringements, and other environmental, social and governance matters. We apply an SCR policy framework with the aim of identifying and managing potential adverse impacts on the environment and / or to human rights, as well as the associated environmental and social risks to which our clients' and our own assets are exposed.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information",

To underline our commitment, we provide transparent targets and report on progress made against them wherever possible. In 2021, we included new targets, in particular pertaining to our commitment to becoming a net-zero bank. Our targets, as set out below, can therefore only partly be compared with what we set out in previous years.\n\n## Our key targets\n\nPlanet, people, partnerships\n\n- -USD 400 billion invested assets in sustainable investments by 2025.\n\n## Planet\n\n- -Set decarbonization targets for 2030 for financing of the fossil fuel, power generation and real estate sectors (from 2020 levels):\n- -reduce absolute financed emissions associated with UBS loans to fossil fuel companies by 71%;\n- -reduce emissions intensity associated with UBS loans to power generation companies by 49%;\n- -reduce emissions intensity of UBS's commercial real estate lending portfolio by 44%; and\n- -reduce emissions intensity of UBS's residential real estate lending portfolio by 42%.\n- -Align USD 235 billion of invested assets to net zero by 2030 (Asset Management).\n- -Achieve net-zero emissions across discretionary client portfolios by 2050.\n- -Achieve net-zero emissions resulting from our own operations (scopes 1 and 2) by 2025; cut energy consumption by 15% by 2025 (compared with 2020).\n- -Offset historical emissions back to the year 2000 by sourcing carbon offsets (achieved by the end of 2021) and by offsetting credit delivery and full retirement in registry (by the end of 2025).\n- -Engage with our key vendors on targeting net zero by 2035.\n\n## People\n\n- -30% global female representation at Director level and above by 2025.\n- -26% US ethnic minority representation at Director level and above by 2025.\n- -26% UK ethnic minority representation at Director level and above by 2025.\n- -Raise USD 1 billion in donations to our client philanthropy foundations and funds and reach 25 million beneficiaries by 2025 (cumulative for 2021-2025).\n- -Support  one  million  beneficiaries  through  our  community impact activities by 2025 (cumulative for 2020-2024).\n\n1 1 This sub-section provides key information from the UBS Climate Report 2021, which contains our full climate disclosures and follows the recommendations provided by the TCFD.

During its six meetings throughout the course of the year, the CCRC reviews the GEB's activities in executing our climate strategy and, jointly with the BoD's Risk Committee, evaluates the progress of our climate risk program. The committee also reviews the alignment of our climate disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD).\n\nWe manage these annual plans and goals through our ISO 14001-certified environmental management system (the EMS), with management accountabilities across our firm. The EMS helps us reduce environmental risks, seize market opportunities, and continually improve our environmental, climate and resourceefficiency performance.\n\nIn May 2021, we established a net-zero task force to help progress toward our ambition of reaching net zero by 2050. The GEB lead for sustainability and impact chairs the task force. Senior representatives from across our firm, including from the business, risk and finance, attend the task force's monthly meetings.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Climate Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for UBS's full climate disclosures",

The physical and transition risks from a changing climate contribute to a structural change across economies and, consequently, can affect banks and the financial sector through financial and non-financial impacts.\n\nIn March 2020, Group Risk Control established our firm's climate risk program to further integrate climate risk in the firm's risk  management  framework  and  standard  processes.  The program  follows  a  multi-year  roadmap  to  address  regulatory expectations and is engaging with stakeholders and experts both internally and  externally to further develop  climate  risk methodologies,  to  deliver  on  ongoing  climate  stress  testing exercises  and  to  build  capacity  to  respond  to  climate  risk management expectations.\n\nWe currently identify and manage climate risks in our own operations, our balance sheet, client assets and the supply chain. To protect our clients' and our own assets from climate-related risks, in 2021, we continued to drive the integration of climaterelated risk into our standard risk management framework.\n\nWe further integrated climate risk in: (i) risk identification and measurement; (ii) monitoring and risk appetite setting; (iii) management and control; and (iv) reporting processes across the organization.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk' in the 'Risk\n\nmanagement and control' section of this report\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Climate Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for a full description of UBS's management of climate risks\n\n## Our climate-related metrics and targets\n\nFor many years, we have been developing methodologies that enable us to disclose climate-related metrics more robustly and transparently. Most recently, regulators and standard setters have provided more guidance on metrics. We firmly aim to keep pace with  these  new  developments  and  requirements  and  further evolve our climate-related metrics. This commitment remains, as does our determination to continue leading the way in efforts to mitigate climate change.\n\nUBS supports the goals of the Paris Agreement, which includes aligning  our  own  operations  and  business  activities  with  a pathway  of  a  five-step  net-zero  plan  to:  (i) measure  carbon emissions;  (ii) define  a  roadmap  and  set  targets;  (iii) reduce climate  impact;  (iv) finance  climate  action  and  support  the transition of our clients; and (v) communicate and engage.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the UBS Climate Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for a full description of UBS's net-zero targets, including baselines and pathways",

UBS Group AG and UBS AG are both subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, pursuant to which the Federal Reserve Board has supervisory authority over the US operations of both UBS Group AG and UBS AG.\n\nIn addition to being a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, UBS AG has US branches, which are authorized and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  UBS AG  is  registered  as  a  swap  dealer  with  the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) and as a securities-based swap dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).\n\nUBS Americas Holding LLC, the intermediate holding company for our operations in the US outside of the UBS AG branch network, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, is subject to requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board related to risk-based capital, liquidity, the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and  Review  stress  testing  and  capital  planning  process,  and resolution planning and governance.\n\nUBS  Bank  USA,  a  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporationinsured depository institution subsidiary, is licensed and regulated by state regulators in Utah.\n\nUBS Financial Services Inc., UBS Securities LLC and several other US subsidiaries of UBS are subject to regulation by a number of different government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the CFTC, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and national securities exchanges, depending on the nature of their business.\n\n## Regulation and supervision in the UK\n\nOur regulated UK operations are mainly subject to the authority of the Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA), which is part of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA). We are also subject to the rules of the London Stock Exchange and other securities and commodities exchanges of which UBS AG is a member.\n\nUBS AG has a UK-registered branch in London, which serves as a global booking center for our Investment Bank.

Our regional hubs are Singapore and Hong Kong SAR.\n\nIn Singapore, we conduct our operations primarily through UBS AG Singapore Branch and UBS Securities Pte. Ltd., which are supervised  by  the  Monetary  Authority  of  Singapore  and  the Singapore Exchange.\n\nUBS AG Hong Kong Branch is primarily supervised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. UBS Securities Hong Kong Limited, UBS Securities Asia Limited and UBS Asset Management (Hong Kong)  Limited  are  primarily  supervised  by  the  Hong  Kong Securities and Futures Commission. In addition, UBS Securities Hong  Kong  Limited  is  supervised  by  the  Hong  Kong  Stock Exchange and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.\n\nIn Mainland China, UBS has multiple licenses to operate its core business  lines,  and  the  various  UBS  entities  are  subject  to regulation by a number of different government agencies. The People's  Bank  of  China  oversees  the  macro  capital  markets policies and ensures coordinated supervisory approaches by the China Banking and Insurance Commission, the China Securities and Regulatory Commission, and the exchanges.\n\n## Financial crime prevention\n\nCombating money laundering and terrorist financing has been a major focus of many governments in recent years. Laws and regulations, including the US Bank Secrecy Act, require effective policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, and the verification of client  identities.  Failure  to  introduce  and  maintain  adequate programs to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing can result in significant legal and reputation risk and fines.\n\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations prohibiting corrupt or illegal payments to government officials and other persons, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act.  We  maintain  policies,  procedures  and  internal  controls intended to comply with those regulations.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-financial risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Data protection\n\nWe are subject to regulations concerning the use and protection of  customer,  employee,  and  other  personal  and  confidential information. This includes provisions under Swiss law, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) and laws of other jurisdictions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information about regulatory change\n\n## Recovery and resolution\n\nSwiss too-big-to-fail (TBTF) legislation requires each Swiss SRB to establish an emergency plan to maintain systemic functions in case  of  impending  insolvency.  In  response  to  these  Swiss requirements, and similar ones in other jurisdictions, UBS has developed recovery plans and resolution strategies, as well as plans for restructuring or winding down businesses if the firm could not be stabilized otherwise.\n\nIn 2013, FINMA stated its preference for a single point of entry (SPE) strategy for globally active SRBs, such as UBS, with a bail-in at the group holding-company level. UBS has made structural, financial and operational changes to facilitate an SPE strategy and is  confident  that  a  resolution  of  the  bank  is  operationally executable and legally enforceable. FINMA published its most recent assessment of Swiss SRBs' emergency and recovery and resolution plans in March 2021, which confirmed that our Swiss emergency plan is effective, subject to further reduction of joint and several liabilities. Since the previous assessment, UBS has reduced its joint and several liabilities to the requested level. FINMA acknowledged progress made in UBS's overall resolvability, by building up the necessary capabilities or removing obstacles to the implementation of the resolution strategy.\n\n## UBS's crisis management framework\n\nOur crisis management framework includes three key governance bodies (see chart on the following page), which take responsibility and action depending on the nature of the stress incident and the scale of the response needed.\n\n- -For incident, risk and crisis management, the Group Crisis Management Committee works with incident management teams that provide monitoring and early-warning indicators at local / regional level, without needing to activate protocols at the Group level. If a local response is insufficient, global task forces and crisis management teams provide decision-making guidance  and  coordination,  including  crisis  management plans,  protocols  and  playbooks,  and  contingency  funding plans.\n- -The Group Executive Board and the Board of Directors would evaluate and decide upon the need to activate the Global Recovery Plan (the GRP) if a stress event reached a severity requiring that, based on the GRP's risk indicators.\n- -FINMA has the authority to determine whether the point of non-viability (PONV) as defined by Swiss law (referred to as 'impending insolvency' in the Banking Act) has been reached and, in such cases, as part of the resolution strategy, has the power to order the bail-in of creditors to recapitalize and stabilize the Group, limit payments of dividends and interest, alter our legal structure, take actions to reduce business risk, and order a restructuring of the bank.",

Recovery options are linked to owners and checklists with the objectives being capital preservation, capital raising and raising funding, and disposal or wind-down of businesses.\n\n## Global Resolution Strategy\n\nFINMA is responsible for developing the resolution strategy for UBS. The planning includes measures that FINMA can take to resolve UBS in an orderly manner if the Group enters into resolution. FINMA has the ultimate authority and responsibility to execute the resolution, in cooperation with the Swiss National Bank, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance and other key authorities. The SPE bail-in strategy would involve writing down the Group's remaining equity and additional tier 1 and tier 2 instruments, as well as bail-in of total loss-absorbing (TLAC)-eligible senior unsecured bonds at the UBS Group AG level. An internal recapitalization of undercapitalized subsidiaries would be made simultaneously with losses transmitted to  UBS  AG  and,  ultimately,  UBS  Group  AG.  Post-resolution restructuring measures could include disposal and winding down of businesses and assets. FINMA noted that we have already taken key preparatory  steps  and  made  good  progress  regarding  global resolvability.\n\n## Local recovery and resolution plans\n\nThe Swiss emergency plan demonstrates how UBS's systemically important functions and critical operations in Switzerland can continue if the UBS Group cannot be restructured. This is achieved mainly by maintaining UBS Switzerland AG as a separate legal entity. FINMA has confirmed that the Swiss emergency plan is effective,  subject  to  further  reduction  of  joint  and  several liabilities.\n\nThe US resolution plan sets out the steps that could be taken to resolve the UBS Americas Holding LLC group if it suffered material financial distress and the UBS Group was unable or unwilling  to  provide  financial  support.  As  required  by  US regulations, our US plan contemplates that UBS Americas Holding LLC  will  commence  US  bankruptcy  proceedings.  Prior  to commencement  thereof,  the  plan  envisages  UBS  Americas Holding LLC down-streaming financial resources to subsidiaries to facilitate orderly wind-down or disposal of businesses.\n\nFollowing  the  cross-border  merger  of  UBS  Limited  into UBS Europe SE, the enlarged European operating subsidiary has developed resolution plans based on Single Resolution Board requirements. Given the relatively small size of UBS Europe SE compared with the overall Group, emphasis is placed on the recovery plan and the resolution strategy for the UBS Group to provide the tools necessary to recapitalize and restructure the entity in case of material financial distress.\n\nOther local recovery and resolution plans exist for various Group entities and jurisdictions.",

        "page_content": "## Regulatory and legal developments\n\n## Developments regarding Sanctions and Export Controls\n\nAs a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions and other measures against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals. UBS's policy is to comply with all applicable laws, including sanctions and export controls, in the jurisdictions in which it operates. At present, numerous complex regimes are developing rapidly in response to the escalating conflict and UBS is working carefully and assiduously to comply with all relevant requirements and to address their potential consequences.\n\n## Developments regarding the too-big-to-fail regulation\n\nIn March 2021, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) published its annual assessment of the recovery and resolution plans of systemically important financial institutions in Switzerland. The report shows that FINMA approved UBS's group recovery plan and assessed its Swiss Emergency Plan as effective. It also highlighted that UBS made further progress in improving its global resolvability by building up the necessary capabilities and removing  obstacles  to  the  implementation  of  the  resolution strategy, while pointing out areas for further improvement.\n\nIn June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council issued the results of its bi-annual review of the Swiss too-big-to-fail regulatory framework.  The  Swiss  Federal  Council  concluded  that  no fundamental changes to the framework are needed. Potential areas for adjustment identified include further tightening of the liquidity requirements for systemically important banks and the alignment of incentive systems to support a bank's resolvability.\n\nIn September 2021, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance launched  a  consultation  on  proposed  revisions  to  the  Swiss Liquidity Ordinance, with the aim of strengthening the resilience of systemically important banks in Switzerland. As proposed, the revisions  would  increase  the  regulatory  minimum  liquidity requirements for systemically important banks, including UBS. The final rule is expected to be published later this year.\n\n## Reactivation of the Swiss countercyclical buffer\n\nIn January 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided, at the request of the SNB, to reactivate the countercyclical capital buffer, at a maximum  level  of  2.5%  on  risk-weighted  positions  that  are directly or indirectly backed  by  residential  properties  in Switzerland. This is expected to increase our common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum capital requirement by approximately 30 basis points. The reactivated countercyclical capital buffer will become effective on 30 September 2022.\n\n## International developments regarding capital regulation\n\nIn March 2021, US banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve  Board  (the  FRB),  the  OCC  and  the  Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation  (the  FDIC)  decided  not  to  extend  the temporary exclusion of central bank deposits and US Treasury securities  from  the  leverage  exposure  calculation  for  the supplementary leverage ratio beyond March 2021. The temporary exemption was applicable to UBS Americas Holding LLC (UBSAH) with respect to US regulatory capital requirements. In addition, the  Federal  Reserve  announced  that  the  limits  on  capital distributions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic would be removed after 30 June 2021. As a result, capital distributions by UBSAH  will  generally  be  permitted  for  as  long  as  it  meets regulatory capital requirements, including the incremental stress capital buffer set by the FRB as part of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test (CCAR). Following the completion of the annual Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST) and CCAR, UBSAH was assigned a stress capital buffer (an SCB) of 7.1% (previously 6.7%) under the SCB rule as of 1 October 2021.\n\nIn  July  2021,  the  European  Central  Bank  announced  its decision  to  remove  COVID-19-related  restrictions  on  capital distributions  and  share  buybacks  by  banks  with  effect  from 1 October 2021.\n\nIn October 2021, the European Commission (the EC) published a legislative proposal to amend the EU's prudential rules for banks to implement the remaining elements of Basel III and revised rules on  resolution.  Once  finalized,  the  EC  envisages  that  these requirements are likely to take effect beginning in 2025 and UBS Europe SE will be subject to these final provisions.\n\nIn addition, the proposal, which may be adjusted in the political process and is expected to be finalized by the end of 2023, includes  a  requirement  that  certain  banking  and  investment services must be provided through a branch in the EU. UBS Group entities currently provide such services in the EU on a cross-border basis. UBS will assess the final requirements to determine whether changes are required ahead of the new framework entering into force.\n\n## Swiss stamp duty and withholding tax\n\nIn June 2021, the Swiss Parliament approved an extension of the current  withholding  tax  exemption  for  total  loss-absorbing capacity instruments, including additional tier 1, from 2021 until the end of 2026.\n\nIn  December  2021,  the  Swiss  Parliament  also  adopted  a legislation that will abolish the withholding tax on bond interest payments (for bonds issued from the beginning of 2023 onward) and will eliminate the securities transfer stamp tax on domestic bonds. However, the withholding tax on interest paid on bank deposits of natural persons with tax domicile in Switzerland is maintained. The reform intends to strengthen the debt capital market in Switzerland, and is expected to take effect in 2023, subject to an optional referendum.",

        "page_content": "## OECD corporate tax reform\n\nIn October 2021, the G20 endorsed the final political agreement on the two-pillar solution reached by the OECD / G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). The twopillar solution consists of Pillar 1, which provides taxing rights to the market jurisdiction from where the profits are derived, and Pillar 2, which introduces a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The G20 called for all the rules to enter into force at a global level by 2024, with some to be implemented in 2023. At the time of publication in October 2021, 137 of the 141 members of the Framework had agreed to the reform and planned to incorporate the new rules into their respective national legislation, including Switzerland. As financial services are expected to be out of scope of Pillar 1, UBS will primarily be affected by Pillar 2. The impact of the  reform  on  UBS  will  depend  on  implementation  by  the adhering countries of the reform.\n\nIn January 2022, the Swiss Federal Council presented the key aspects  of  the  implementation  in  Switzerland.  The  relevant changes will require a constitutional amendment, which triggers a mandatory referendum. The government aims to implement the minimum tax rate as of 1 January 2024.\n\n## Revision of the Swiss Anti-Money-Laundering Act\n\nIn March 2021, the Swiss Parliament granted final approval for the  revision  of  the  Swiss  Anti-Money-Laundering  (AML)  Act, which incorporates several but not all, of the recommendations from the enhanced follow-up process of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (the FATF). The revision will introduce into Swiss law further specifications of the obligation to file suspicious activity reports and increase the frequency of client data reviews. It will also improve transparency by incorporating additional legal requirements for associations with elevated risks of terrorist financing. However, the FATF's recommendation to extend the scope of the Swiss AML Act to advisors (e.g., attorneys, fiduciaries,  and  tax  advisors)  was  not  adopted  by  the  Swiss Parliament.\n\nOn 1 October 2021, the Federal Council issued a draft revision of the Anti-Money-Laundering Ordinance (AMLO) to detail the implementation of the changes. The consultation on the AMLO ended on 17 January 2022, and the revisions are expected to enter into force by mid-2022. UBS is in the process of adjusting its AML processes to reflect the new requirements.\n\n## Developments regarding environmental, social and governance matters\n\n2021 saw a significant number of sustainability-related policy developments, with a particular focus on disclosure requirements, across various jurisdictions.\n\nIn  March  2021,  the  EU  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosures Regulation (the SFDR) came into effect. The regulation defines standards regarding, among other matters, how investors should be informed about sustainability risks and how the impact of investments on the environment and society should be disclosed. This regulation concerns any prospectus of UBS's EU-domiciled and EU-marketed funds.\n\nIn April 2021, the EC published a legislative proposal for a revised Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) requiring firms to publish enhanced information about their activities with regard to environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related matters.\n\nIn  July  2021,  the  EC  adopted  regulations  prescribing  the content,  methodology  and  presentation  of  climate-related disclosures that are required under Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.  As  part  of  their  non-financial  reporting,  credit institutions will be required to disclose a green asset ratio covering the banking book and certain trading portfolios, as well as other key performance indicators (KPIs), including the proportion of green taxonomy-aligned off-balance sheet exposures and fees and commission income. Starting with the annual reporting for 2021, taxonomy-eligible assets are required to be disclosed; the remaining set of KPIs is to be fully phased in for our annual reporting for 2025. These disclosure requirements will apply to UBS AG and UBS Europe SE.\n\nIn August 2021, the Swiss Federal Council decided to introduce mandatory  reporting  requirements  for  large  Swiss  companies based on the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (the FSB) Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD). A consultation on the draft proposal is planned in mid2022, with mandatory requirements expected to apply to the 2023 annual reporting. Our disclosures are already largely aligned with the 2017 TCFD recommendations and we expect to fully implement those by the end of 2022.\n\nIn November 2021, the Swiss Federal Council published several recommendations to increase transparency regarding climaterelated information and reporting in the Swiss financial center, including that: i) financial market participants use comparable and meaningful climate compatibility indicators to create transparency for all financial products and client portfolios; and ii) the financial sector joins international net-zero alliances. UBS has joined the Glasgow  Financial  Alliance  for  Net  Zero  (GFANZ)  and  is participating in an industry-wide working group led by the Swiss Federal  Department  of  Finance  (the  FDF)  to  develop  climate compatibility  indicators.  The  Swiss  Federal  Council  has  also instructed  the  FDF  to  work  with  the  Department  of  the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) and FINMA to jointly assess, by the end of 2022, whether any changes to financial market rules may help avoid greenwashing, and, if necessary, to propose binding guidelines.\n\nIn November 2021, FINMA issued guidance on preventing and combating greenwashing in the context of sustainability-related collective investment schemes. The guidance sets out FINMA's expectations regarding: the advertised sustainability characteristics in fund documents of respective Swiss collective investment  schemes;  appropriate  organizational  structures  of institutions that manage sustainability-related Swiss or foreign collective  investment  schemes;  and  the  integration  of  ESG considerations into the process of advising clients.\n\nIn November 2021, the Swiss Environmental Commission of the  Council  of  States  agreed  to  start  work  on  an  indirect counterproposal  to  the  'Glacier  Initiative.'  Both  the  original initiative and the counterproposal aim to embed in national law a net-zero  target  to  be  achieved  by  2050.  The  Environmental Commission of the National Council will formulate a draft in early 2022, but the public vote will not take place before 2023.\n\nIn November  2021,  the  Basel Committee  on  Banking Supervision (the BCBS) issued a consultation on Principles for the effective management and supervision of climate-related financial risks. The consultation paper proposes 18 principles to improve climate-related financial risk management  by  banks  and supervisors. The proposal states that banks should incorporate climate risks into their capital and liquidity adequacy assessments.",

        "page_content": "In  November  2021,  the  International  Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation Trustees announced the creation of a new standard-setting board, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), which will be tasked with developing a comprehensive global baseline for sustainability-related disclosure standards that will provide investors and other capital market participants with information about companies' sustainabilityrelated  risks  and  opportunities  in  order  to  help  them  make informed decisions.\n\nIn December 2021, the Swiss Federal Council opened the consultation on the revised CO2 Act following its rejection in a public vote earlier in 2021. The new proposal contains measures to reduce carbon emissions for the period from 2025 to 2030 and mandates  FINMA  and  the  Swiss  National  Bank  to  report  on climate-related financial risks.\n\nIn December 2021, the Federal Council specified new due diligence requirements to implement the counterproposal to the Responsible  Business  Initiative.  The  changes  to  the  Code  of Obligations require large Swiss companies to report on risks of their business activities in the areas of the environment, social issues, employee concerns, human rights, and the fight against corruption, as well as on the measures taken to mitigate these risks. Companies active in sensitive areas with a risk of child labor and conflict minerals must comply with additional due diligence and reporting obligations. The details of these requirements are outlined in a separate ordinance. The new provisions entered into force on 1 January 2022. The law grants companies one year to adapt to the new obligations. These will therefore be applied for the first time in the 2023 financial year.\n\nIn December 2021, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC) issued a consultation on supervisory guidance regarding firms' climate risk management practices. While the proposal broadly aligns with that issued by the BCBS in November, it also represents the first step of US banking regulators regarding expectations of supervised firms in their capacity to measure and control exposures to potential climate change issues.\n\nStarting with our 2021 annual reporting, we comply with the revised  FINMA  Circular  2016/1  'Disclosure  -  banks,'  which includes climate risk-related disclosure requirements. We provide information required by Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, starting with the disclosure of taxonomy-eligible assets of UBS AG and UBS Europe SE on a standalone basis for year-end 2021.\n\n## Developments regarding digitalization and innovation in finance\n\nRegulatory discussions on various aspects of digital innovation in finance  and,  in  particular,  virtual  assets  have  increased  and continued to evolve. However, national regulatory approaches on the subject still differ widely.\n\nIn June 2021, the BCBS consulted on an approach to the prudential treatment of virtual assets as part of a multi-year process to develop internationally aligned prudential rules.\n\nIn October 2021, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) consulted on guidance proposing that the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures should also apply to systemically important stablecoin arrangements.\n\nIn October 2021, the FATF updated its 2019 Guidance for a risk-based approach to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs), who are subject to the same relevant FATF measures that apply to financial institutions. The guidance aims to  help  countries  and  VASPs  understand  their  obligations regarding  anti-money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing  and effectively implement the FATF's requirements.\n\nIn  November  2021,  EU  legislators  made  further  progress toward agreement on the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation, which aims to establish a comprehensive EU-wide regulatory framework for the issuance of, and provision of services related to, various types of virtual assets. The legislation is expected to be finalized by mid-2022.\n\nIn November 2021, the US President's Working Group on Financial Markets released a paper on stablecoins recommending that US Congress enact legislation to restrict issuers of stablecoins to supervised, deposit-taking banks. In the absence of legislation, the US Financial Stability Oversight Council could designate the activity  as  systemically  important  and  place  them  under  the authority of the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn 2021, several central banks continued their efforts to actively explore central bank digital currencies (CBDC), including with each  other,  with  the  BIS  Innovation  Hub  network  and  with commercial banks. For example, UBS participated in SNB- and Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange (SIX)-led CBDC projects named Helvetia and Jura. The introduction of CBDC could potentially have a significant impact on the financial sector, though the implications are not yet fully understood. In January 2022, the Federal Reserve released its discussion paper on CBDC, seeking public  input  on  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  these products and the preservation of monetary and financial stability while complementing existing means of payment.\n\nIn February 2022, the Swiss Federal Council published its report on framework conditions for digital finance in Switzerland, which includes  measures  linked  to  12  prioritized  action  areas.  The Federal Department of Finance will implement the measures in 2022 and subsequent years in close coordination with relevant stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector.  Among  the  policy topics addressed  are  open  finance,  artificial intelligence, distributed ledger technology, cybersecurity, green fintech, the Cloud, data sharing and cross-border data flows.\n\n## Operational resilience and cybersecurity\n\nIn 2021,  there  were  several  regulatory  developments  on operational resilience and cybersecurity.\n\nIn March  2021,  the  BCBS  published  its  Principles  for Operational  Resilience  (the  BCBS  Principles),  providing  global standards intended to strengthen the ability of banks to absorb operational  risk-related  events  that  could  cause  significant operational failures or widescale disruption in financial markets.\n\nIn March 2021, the Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) published their final rules on the UK operational resilience framework. The new rules require firms to identify their important business services, set impact tolerances for such and commence testing against severe but plausible scenarios by 31 March 2022. Firms are expected to introduce any required resilience reinforcements by 31 March 2025. The rules in the UK will apply to UBS AG London Branch and other Group entities that provide services to UBS AG London Branch.",

        "page_content": "In the fourth quarter of 2021, both the Monetary Authority of Singapore  and  the  Hong  Kong  Monetary  Authority  issued consultations  on  proposed  rules  to  incorporate  the  BCBS Principles for Operational Resilience into their regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Rules in the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong SAR are broadly aligned to the BCBS Principles.\n\nUBS  established  a  global  Enhanced  Operational  Resilience program in August 2020 with the aim of ensuring implementation and alignment with key regulatory requirements on operational resilience.\n\nIn November 2021, the US banking regulators, including the FRB,  the  OCC  and  the  FDIC  published  final  rules  regarding computer  security  incident  reporting  requirements,  including thresholds and timing, that apply to supervised banks and service providers and become effective in April 2022.\n\nIn  January  2022,  the  Swiss  Federal  Council  initiated  a consultation on a proposal to introduce a reporting obligation for cyberattacks  on  critical  infrastructures,  including  banks.  The proposal defines the tasks of the National Cybersecurity Centre, the designated central recipient of the reports. The consultation will last until 14 April 2022. Once finalized, UBS will need to adjust its reporting processes accordingly.\n\n## Developments regarding the relationship between Switzerland and the European Union\n\nIn May 2021, the Swiss Federal Council terminated negotiations on the Institutional Framework Agreement (the IFA) between Switzerland and the European Union (the EU) due to substantial differences of opinion regarding key aspects of the agreement. The IFA would have formed a mutually agreed basis to consolidate and  further  develop  Switzerland's  bilateral  market  access approach with the EU. As a result, the EU is unlikely to be ready to  conclude  new  market  access  agreements  -  including  on financial services - with Switzerland in the near future.\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  Swiss  Federal  Council  decided  to extend the existing measure protecting the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure (which was due to expire on 31 December 2021) until  31 December  2025  and  to  open  a  consultation  on incorporating this measure into the Financial Market Infrastructure  Act.  In  the  absence  of  mutual  recognition  of equivalence  by  both  Swiss  and  EU  authorities,  the  measure requires EU investment firms to trade Swiss equities on Swiss stock exchanges. UBS had previously adjusted its internal processes to reflect this measure.\n\n## Revision of the Swiss Banking Act\n\nIn December 2021, the Swiss Parliament adopted a revision of the Banking  Act.  The  legislative  amendment  aims  to  strengthen depositor protection and promote financial system stability by reducing the time needed to pay out protected deposits through the depositor protection scheme in the event a bank enters bankruptcy. Among other measures, it will also require banks to\n\ndeposit 50% of the contribution obligations in securities or Swiss francs. The revision also introduces amendments with regard to insolvency law and segregation, in particular the introduction of a more detailed and solid legal basis for bail-in, including the ranking of claims subject to bail in, ensuring legal certainty for the operationalization of a bail-in. The new provisions also provide for the subordination of bail-in-bonds, with the exception of such bail-in-bonds issued by a holding company if other debt ranking pari passu does not exceed 5% of the total bail-in-bond debt. The revised Banking Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2023. We expect moderate costs for all Switzerland-based UBS Group entities that are within the scope of the revision.\n\n## Review of restrictions on the business model of PostFinance AG\n\nIn January 2021, the Swiss Federal Council announced that it intends  to  privatize  PostFinance  AG,  a  Swiss  systemically important bank, which is held by the state-owned Swiss Post AG. As  a  result,  the  prohibition  on  PostFinance  AG  granting mortgages and other types of loans would be lifted, among other changes. As the envisaged changes require a revision of the Post Organization Act, the Swiss Parliament will ultimately decide on any changes.\n\nIn June 2021, the Swiss Federal Council submitted a dispatch to the Swiss Parliament. If the revision passes the legislative process, which is expected to start in 2022, the reform could further intensify competition in the Swiss mortgage market.\n\n## Registration under the US security-based swaps regulations\n\nIn October 2021, FINMA and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) finalized a memorandum of understanding relating to cooperation in oversight of Swiss entities registered under the SEC's security-based swaps regulations. The SEC also published  a  substituted  compliance  order  modifying  the application of certain of its regulations for Swiss security-based swap dealers. Under SEC regulations, UBS AG has been registered as a security-based swap dealer since 1 November 2021.\n\n## Developments regarding LIBOR\n\nIn March 2021, the FCA confirmed that the one-week and twomonth US dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (USD LIBOR) settings, along with all GBP, EUR, CHF, and JPY LIBOR settings, would, immediately after 31 December 2021, either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative of the  underlying  market.  The  FCA  further  confirmed  that  the remaining  USD  LIBOR  settings  will  cease  immediately  after 30 June 2023.\n\nIn October 2021, the FRB issued guidance that banks should, with  limited  exceptions,  cease  to  enter  into  new  contracts referencing USD LIBOR as soon as practicable and, in any event, no later than 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nCertain risks, including those described below, may affect our ability to execute our strategy or our business activities, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are inherently exposed to multiple risks, many of which may become apparent only with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, risks that we do not consider to be material, or of which we are not currently aware, could also adversely affect us. Within each category, the risks that we consider to be most material are presented first.\n\n## Market, credit and macroeconomic risks\n\n## Performance in the financial services industry is affected by market conditions and the macroeconomic climate\n\nOur businesses are materially affected by market and macroeconomic  conditions.  A  market  downturn  and  weak macroeconomic conditions can be precipitated by a number of factors, including geopolitical events, such as international armed conflicts, the imposition of sanctions, global trade or global supply chain disruptions, changes in monetary or fiscal policy, changes in trade policies or international trade disputes, significant inflationary or deflationary price changes, disruptions in one or more concentrated economic sectors, natural disasters, pandemics, civil unrest, acts of violence, war or terrorism. Such developments can have unpredictable and destabilizing effects.\n\nFor example, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 and the ongoing hostilities, Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others have announced sanctions against certain Russian banks, companies and individuals, as well as the Russian Central Bank, and have announced that certain Russian banks  will  be  barred  from  using  the  Society  for  Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) messaging system. In addition, it is estimated that one million people have been displaced inside Ukraine and many of those displaced may seek refuge in Poland and other neighboring countries, as the conflict continues these numbers are likely to increase. The scale of  the  conflict  and  the  unprecedented  speed  and  extent  of sanctions may produce many of the effects described above, including in ways that cannot now be anticipated.\n\nAdverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, securities prices, market volatility and liquidity, foreign exchange rates, commodity  prices,  and  other  market  fluctuations,  as  well  as changes  in  investor  sentiment,  can  affect  our  earnings  and ultimately our financial and capital positions. As financial markets are global and highly interconnected, local and regional events can have widespread effects well beyond the countries in which\n\nthey occur. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business or financial results.\n\nIf  individual  countries  impose  restrictions  on  cross-border payments, trade, or other exchange or capital controls, or change their currency (for example, if one or more countries should leave the Eurozone or as result of the imposition of sanctions on individuals, entities or countries), we could suffer losses from enforced default by counterparties, be unable to access our own assets, or be unable to effectively manage our risks.\n\nShould the market experience significant volatility, a decrease in business and client activity and market volumes could result, which would adversely affect our ability to generate transaction fees, commissions and margins, particularly in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank, as we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018. A market downturn would likely reduce the volume and valuation of assets that we manage on behalf of clients, which would reduce recurring fee income that is charged based on invested assets in Global Wealth Management and Asset  Management  and  performance-based  fees  in  Asset Management. Such a downturn could also cause a decline in the value of assets that we own and account for as investments or trading positions. In addition, reduced market liquidity or volatility may  limit  trading  opportunities  and  may  therefore  reduce transaction-based income and may also impede our ability to manage risks.\n\nWe could be materially affected if a crisis develops, regionally or  globally,  as  a  result  of  disruptions  in  markets  due  to macroeconomic or political developments, or as a result of the failure of a major market participant. Over time, our strategic plans have become more heavily dependent on our ability to generate growth and revenue in emerging markets, including China, causing us to be more exposed to the risks associated with such markets.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management derives revenues from all the principal regions, but has a greater concentration in Asia than many peers and a substantial presence in the US, unlike many European peers. The Investment Bank's business is more heavily weighted to Europe and Asia than our peers, while its derivatives business is more heavily weighted to structured products for wealth management clients, in particular with European and Asian  underlyings.  Our  performance  may  therefore  be  more affected by political, economic and market developments in these regions  and  businesses  than  some  other  financial  service providers.",

Governments  and  central  banks around the world reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates and have begun to phase out pandemic relief. In  addition,  while  vaccination  campaigns  have  had significant success in some regions and a number of economies are recovering, outbreaks in locations where vaccination rates are low or vaccines are unavailable on a large scale, as well as the spread of new variants of COVID-19, create uncertainty around a sustainable recovery. Resurgence of the pandemic, ineffectiveness of vaccines and continuance or imposition of new pandemic control measures may result in additional adverse effects on the global economy negatively affecting UBS's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected all of UBS's businesses, and these effects could be greater in the future if adverse conditions persist or worsen. These effects included declines in some asset prices, spikes in volatility, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, lower or negative interest rates, widening of credit spreads and credit deterioration. These effects have resulted in decreases in the valuation of loans and commitments, an increase in the allowance for credit losses and lower valuations of certain classes  of  trading  assets.  While  many  of  these  effects  have reversed as economies have reopened and economic stimulus has been maintained, or were offset by high levels of client activity and by improved asset prices in many sectors in 2021, these favorable conditions may not persist. In particular, real estate markets in some regions may be significantly disrupted as a result of repeated temporary closures of business, sheltering-in-place directives, and remote work protocols enacted to respond to seasonal increases in infection rates of COVID-19.\n\nShould inflationary pressures or other adverse global market conditions persist, or should the pandemic lead to additional economic or market disruptions, we may experience reduced client activity and demand for our products and services, increased utilization of lending commitments, significantly increased client defaults, continued and increasing credit and valuation losses in our loan portfolios, loan commitments and other assets, and impairments of other financial assets.\n\nA fall in equity markets and consequent decline in invested assets would also reduce recurring fee income in our Global Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses. These factors and other consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively  affect  our  financial  condition,  including  possible constraints on capital and liquidity, as well as a higher cost of capital, and possible downgrades to our credit ratings.\n\nThe extent to which the pandemic, and the related adverse economic conditions, affect our businesses, results of operations\n\nand financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the adequacy of vaccine distribution plans and execution of those plans, as well as the efficacy of vaccines against potential virus variants, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our customers, counterparties, employees and third-party service providers.\n\n## Our credit risk exposure to clients, trading counterparties and other financial institutions would increase under adverse or other economic conditions\n\nCredit risk is an integral part of many of our activities, including lending, underwriting and derivatives activities. Adverse economic or market conditions, or the imposition of sanctions or other restrictions on clients, counterparties or financial institutions, may lead  to  impairments  and  defaults  on  these  credit  exposures. Losses may be exacerbated by declines in the value of collateral securing loans and other exposures. In our prime brokerage, securities finance and Lombard lending businesses, we extend substantial amounts of credit against securities collateral, the value or liquidity of which may decline rapidly. Market closures the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures. Our Swiss mortgage and corporate lending portfolios are a large part of our overall lending. We are therefore exposed to the risk of  adverse  economic  developments  in  Switzerland,  including property valuations in the housing market, the strength of the Swiss franc and its effect on Swiss exports, prevailing negative interest  rates  applied  by  the  Swiss  National  Bank,  economic conditions within the Eurozone or the EU, and the evolution of agreements  between  Switzerland  and  the  EU  or  European Economic  Area,  which  represent  Switzerland's  largest  export market.  We  have  exposures  related  to  real  estate  in  various countries,  including  a  substantial  Swiss  mortgage  portfolio. Although we believe this portfolio is prudently managed, we could  nevertheless  be  exposed  to  losses  if  a  substantial deterioration in the Swiss real estate market were to occur.\n\nAs we experienced in 2020, under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) regime, credit loss expenses may increase rapidly at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit impairments (stage 3), as well as higher ECL from stages 1 and 2. Substantial increases in ECL could exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely affect our common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and regulatory capital ratios.\n\n## Interest rate trends and changes could negatively affect our financial results\n\nThe low or negative interest rate environment, particularly in Switzerland and the Eurozone, may further erode interest margins and adversely affect the net interest income generated by the Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses. The Swiss National Bank permits Swiss banks to make deposits up to a threshold at zero interest. Any reduction in or limitation  on  the  use  of  this  exemption  from  the  otherwise applicable negative interest rates would exacerbate the effect of negative interest rates in Switzerland on our business.",

        "page_content": "Low and negative interest rates may also affect customer behavior  and  hence  our  overall  balance  sheet  structure. Mitigating actions that we have taken, or may take in the future, such as the introduction of selective deposit fees or minimum lending rates, have resulted and may further result in the loss of customer deposits (a key source of funding for us), net new money outflows and a declining market share in our Swiss lending business. Interest rates in the US and some other markets are expected to increase as central banks respond to higher inflation. As returns for alternatives to deposits, such as money market funds, increase with interest rates, we may experience outflows of  customer  deposits  or  a  higher  cost  of  deposit  funding  if customers shift from deposits to alternative products.\n\nOur  shareholders'  equity  and  capital  are  also  affected  by changes in interest rates. In particular, the calculation of our Swiss pension plan's net defined benefit assets and liabilities is sensitive to the applied discount rate and to fluctuations in the value of pension plan assets. Any further reduction in interest rates may lower the discount rates and result in pension plan deficits as a result of the long duration of corresponding liabilities. This could lead to a corresponding reduction in our equity and CET1 capital.\n\n## Currency fluctuation may have an adverse effect on our profits, balance sheet and regulatory capital\n\nWe are subject to currency fluctuation risks. Although our change from the Swiss franc to the US dollar as our functional and presentation currency in 2018 reduces our exposure to currency fluctuation risks with respect to the Swiss franc, a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar. Additionally, in order to hedge our CET1 capital  ratio,  our  CET1  capital  must  have  foreign  currency exposure, which leads to currency sensitivity. As a consequence, it is not possible to simultaneously fully hedge both the amount of capital and the capital ratio. Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our profits, balance sheet and capital, leverage and liquidity coverage ratios.\n\n## Regulatory and legal risks\n\n## Material legal and regulatory risks arise in the conduct of our business\n\nAs a global financial services firm operating in more than 50 countries, we are subject to many different legal, tax and regulatory regimes, including extensive regulatory oversight, and are exposed to significant liability risk. We are subject to a large number of claims, disputes, legal proceedings and government investigations, and we expect that our ongoing business activities will continue to give rise to such matters in the future. The extent of our financial exposure  to  these  and  other  matters  is  material  and  could substantially exceed the level of provisions that we have established. We  are  not  able  to  predict  the  financial  and  non-financial consequences these matters may have when resolved.\n\nWe may be subject to adverse preliminary determinations or court decisions that may negatively affect public perception and our reputation, result in prudential actions from regulators, and cause us to record additional provisions for such matters even when we believe we have substantial defenses and expect to ultimately achieve a more favorable outcome. This risk is illustrated by the award of aggregate penalties and damages of EUR 4.5 billion by the court of first instance in France. This award was reduced to an aggregate of EUR 1.8 billion by the Court of Appeal, and UBS has further appealed this judgment.\n\nResolution of regulatory proceedings may require us to obtain waivers of regulatory disqualifications to maintain certain operations; may entitle regulatory authorities to limit, suspend or terminate licenses and regulatory authorizations; and may permit financial  market  utilities  to  limit,  suspend  or  terminate  our participation  in  them.  Failure  to  obtain  such  waivers,  or  any limitation, suspension or termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material adverse consequences for us.\n\nOur settlements with governmental authorities in connection with foreign exchange, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) and  other  benchmark  interest  rates  starkly  illustrate  the significantly increased level of financial and reputational risk now associated  with  regulatory  matters  in  major  jurisdictions.  In connection  with  investigations  related  to  LIBOR  and  other benchmark rates and to foreign exchange and precious metals, very large fines and disgorgement amounts were assessed against us, and we were required to enter guilty pleas despite our full cooperation with the authorities in the investigations, and despite our receipt of conditional leniency or conditional immunity from anti-trust authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the US and Switzerland.\n\nFor a number of years we have been, and we continue to be, subject to a very high level of regulatory scrutiny and to certain regulatory measures that constrain our strategic flexibility. We believe we have remediated the deficiencies that led to significant losses in the past and made substantial changes in our controls and conduct risk frameworks to address the issues highlighted by the  LIBOR-related,  foreign  exchange  and  precious  metals regulatory resolutions. We have also undertaken extensive efforts to implement new regulatory requirements and meet heightened expectations.\n\nWe continue to be in active dialog with regulators concerning the  actions  we  are  taking  to  improve  our  operational  risk management, risk control, anti-money laundering, data management and other frameworks, and otherwise seek to meet supervisory expectations, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the desired effects. As a result of this history, our level  of  risk  with  respect  to  regulatory  enforcement  may  be greater than that of some of our peers.\n\n## Substantial changes in regulation may adversely affect our businesses and our ability to execute our strategic plans\n\nSince the financial crisis of 2008, we are subject to significant regulatory  requirements,  including  recovery  and  resolution planning, changes in capital and prudential standards, changes in taxation  regimes  as  a  result  of  changes  in  governmental administrations, as well as new and revised market standards and fiduciary duties. Notwithstanding attempts by regulators to align their efforts, the measures adopted or proposed for banking regulation  differ  significantly  across  the  major  jurisdictions, making it increasingly difficult to manage a global institution. In addition, Swiss regulatory changes with regard to such matters as capital and liquidity have often proceeded more quickly than those in other major jurisdictions, and Switzerland's requirements for major international banks are among the strictest of the major financial centers. This could put Swiss banks, such as UBS, at a disadvantage when competing with peer financial institutions subject to more lenient regulation or with unregulated non-bank competitors.",

        "page_content": "Our implementation of additional regulatory requirements and changes in supervisory standards, as well as our compliance with existing laws and regulations, continue to receive heightened scrutiny  from  supervisors.  If  we  do  not  meet  supervisory expectations in relation to these or other matters, or if additional supervisory or regulatory issues arise, we would likely be subject to further regulatory scrutiny as well as measures that may further constrain our strategic flexibility.\n\nResolvability and resolution and recovery planning: We have moved  significant  operations  into  subsidiaries  to  improve resolvability and meet other regulatory requirements, and this has resulted in substantial implementation costs, increased our capital and  funding  costs  and  reduced  operational  flexibility.  For example, we have transferred all of our US subsidiaries under a US  intermediate  holding  company  to  meet  US  regulatory requirements, and have transferred substantially all the operations of Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management booked in Switzerland to UBS Switzerland AG to improve resolvability.\n\nThese changes create operational, capital, liquidity, funding and tax inefficiencies. Our operations in subsidiaries are subject to local capital, liquidity, stable funding, capital planning and stress testing  requirements.  These  requirements  have  resulted  in increased capital and liquidity requirements in affected subsidiaries, which limit our operational flexibility and negatively affect our ability to benefit from synergies between business units and to distribute earnings to the Group.\n\nUnder  the  Swiss  too-big-to-fail  (TBTF)  framework,  we  are required to put in place viable emergency plans to preserve the operation of systemically important functions in the event of a failure. Moreover, under this framework and similar regulations in the US, the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate,  we  are  required  to  prepare  credible  recovery  and resolution plans detailing the measures that would be taken to recover in a significant adverse event or in the event of winding down the Group or the operations in a host country through resolution or insolvency proceedings. If a recovery or resolution plan that we produce is determined by the relevant authority to be inadequate or not credible, relevant regulation may permit the authority to place limitations on the scope or size of our business in that jurisdiction, or oblige us to hold higher amounts of capital or liquidity or to change our legal structure or business in order to remove the relevant impediments to resolution.\n\nCapital and prudential standards: As an internationally active Swiss systemically relevant bank (an SRB), we are subject to capital and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements that are among the most stringent in the world. Moreover, many of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements and, as a result, UBS Group AG and UBS AG have contributed a significant portion of their capital and provide substantial liquidity to these subsidiaries. These funds are available to meet funding and collateral needs in the relevant entities, but are generally not readily available for use by the Group as a whole.\n\nWe expect our risk-weighted assets (RWA) to further increase as the effective date for additional capital standards promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) draws nearer.\n\nIncreases in capital and liquidity standards could significantly curtail our ability to pursue strategic opportunities or to return capital to shareholders.\n\nMarket regulation and fiduciary standards: Our wealth and asset  management  businesses  operate  in  an  environment  of increasing  regulatory  scrutiny  and  changing  standards  with respect to fiduciary and other standards of care and the focus on mitigating or eliminating conflicts of interest between a manager or advisor and the client, which require effective implementation across the global systems and processes of investment managers and other industry participants. For example, we have made material changes to our business processes, policies and the terms on which we interact with these clients in order to comply with SEC Regulation Best Interest, which is intended to enhance and clarify the duties of brokers and investment advisers to retail customers, the Volcker Rule, which limits our ability to engage in proprietary trading, as well as changes in European and Swiss market conduct regulation. Future changes in the regulation of our duties to customers may require us to make further changes to our businesses, which would result in additional expense and may adversely affect our business. We may also become subject to other similar regulations substantively limiting the types of activities in which we may engage or the way we conduct our operations.\n\nIn many instances, we provide services on a cross-border basis, and we are therefore sensitive to barriers restricting market access for  third-country  firms.  In  particular,  efforts  in  the  EU  to harmonize  the  regime  for  third-country  firms  to  access  the European market may have the effect of creating new barriers that adversely affect our ability to conduct business in these jurisdictions from  Switzerland.  In  addition,  a  number  of jurisdictions  are  increasingly  regulating  cross-border  activities based  on  determinations  of  equivalence  of  home  country regulation, substituted compliance or similar principles of comity. A negative determination with respect to Swiss equivalence could limit our access to the market in those jurisdictions and may negatively  influence  our  ability  to  act  as  a  global  firm.  For example, the EU declined to extend its equivalence determination for Swiss exchanges, which lapsed as of 30 June 2019.\n\nUBS experienced cross-border outflows over a number of years as a result of heightened focus by fiscal authorities on crossborder investment and fiscal amnesty programs, in anticipation of the  implementation  in  Switzerland  of  the  global  automatic exchange of tax information, and as a result of the measures UBS has implemented in response to these changes. Further changes in local tax laws or regulations and their enforcement, additional cross-border  tax  information  exchange  regimes,  national  tax amnesty or enforcement programs or similar actions may affect our clients' ability or willingness to do business with us and could result in additional cross-border outflows.",

Such powers include ordering protective measures, instituting restructuring proceedings (and exercising any  Swiss  resolution  powers  in  connection  therewith),  and instituting  liquidation  proceedings,  all  of  which  may  have  a material adverse effect on shareholders and creditors or may prevent UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG from paying dividends or making payments on debt obligations.\n\nUBS would have limited ability to challenge any such protective measures, and creditors and shareholders would also have limited ability under Swiss law or in Swiss courts to reject them, seek their suspension, or challenge their imposition, including measures that require or result in the deferment of payments.\n\nIf restructuring proceedings are opened with respect to UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG, the resolution powers that FINMA may exercise include the power to: (i) transfer all or some of the assets, debt and other liabilities, and contracts of the entity subject to proceedings to another entity; (ii) stay for a maximum of two business days (a) the termination of, or the exercise of rights to terminate, netting rights, (b) rights to enforce or dispose of certain types of collateral or (c) rights to transfer claims, liabilities or certain collateral, under contracts to which the entity subject to proceedings is a party; and / or (iii) partially or fully  write  down  the  equity  capital  and  regulatory  capital instruments and, if such regulatory capital is fully written down, convert debt instruments of the entity subject to proceedings into equity. Shareholders and creditors would have no right to reject, or to seek the suspension of, any restructuring plan pursuant to which such resolution powers are exercised. They would have only limited rights to challenge any decision to exercise resolution powers  or  to  have  that  decision  reviewed  by  a  judicial  or administrative process or otherwise.\n\nUpon full or partial write-down of the equity and regulatory capital  instruments  of  the  entity  subject  to  restructuring proceedings,  the  relevant  shareholders  and  creditors  would receive no payment in respect of the equity and debt that is written down, the write-down would be permanent, and the investors would likely not, at such time or at any time thereafter, receive any shares or other participation rights, or be entitled to\n\nany  write-up  or  any  other  compensation  in  the  event  of  a potential subsequent recovery of the debtor. If FINMA orders the conversion  of  debt  of  the  entity  subject  to  restructuring proceedings into equity, the securities received by the investors may be worth significantly less than the original debt and may have a significantly different risk profile. In addition, creditors receiving equity would be effectively subordinated to all creditors of the restructured entity in the event of a subsequent winding up, liquidation or dissolution of the restructured entity, which would increase the risk that investors would lose all or some of their investment.\n\nFINMA has significant discretion in the exercise of its powers in connection with restructuring proceedings. Furthermore, certain categories of debt obligations, such as certain types of deposits, are subject to preferential treatment. As a result, holders of obligations  of  an  entity  subject  to  a  Swiss  restructuring proceeding may have their obligations written down or converted into equity even though obligations ranking on par with such obligations are not written down or converted.\n\nWe may be unable to fully realize our sustainability, climate, environmental and social goals, which could damage our business prospects, reputation and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and increased risk of litigation\n\nWe  have  set  ambitious  goals  for  environmental,  social  and governance  matters.  These  goals  include  our  ambitions  for environmental sustainability in our operations, including carbon emissions, in the business we do with clients and in products that we offer. They also include goals or ambitions for diversity in our workforce and supply chain, and support for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. There is substantial uncertainty as  to  the  scope  of  actions  that  may  be  required  of  us, governments and others to achieve the goals we have set, and many of our goals and objectives are only achievable with a combination of government and private action. National and international  standards,  industry  and  scientific  practices,  and regulatory  taxonomies  and  disclosure  obligations  addressing these matters are in a state of rapid development. Although we have defined and disclosed our goals based on the standards that exist today, there can be no assurance that the various ESG regulatory and disclosure regimes under which we operate will not come into conflict with one another or that the current standards will not be interpreted differently than our understanding or change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for us to achieve such goals or that such goals may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve. If we are not able to achieve the goals we have set, or can only do so at significant expense to our business, we may fail to meet regulatory expectations, incur damage to our reputation or be exposed to risk of litigation or other adverse action.",

        "page_content": "## Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions and valuations, as well as changes to accounting standards\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS).  The application of these accounting standards requires the use of judgment based on estimates and assumptions that may involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. This is the case, for example, with respect to the measurement of fair value of financial instruments, the recognition of deferred tax assets, the assessment of the impairment of goodwill, expected credit losses and estimation of provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. Such judgments, including the underlying estimates and assumptions, which encompass historical experience, expectations  of  the  future  and  other  factors,  are  regularly evaluated  to  determine  their  continuing  relevance  based  on current conditions. Using different assumptions could cause the reported results to differ. Changes in assumptions, or failure to make the changes necessary to reflect evolving market conditions, may have a significant effect on the financial statements in the periods when changes occur. Estimates of provisions may be subject to a wide range of potential outcomes and significant uncertainty. For example, the broad range of potential outcomes in our proceeding in France increases the uncertainty associated with assessing the appropriate provision. If the estimates and assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, our financial results may also be negatively affected.\n\nChanges to IFRS or interpretations thereof may cause future reported  results  and  financial  position  to  differ  from  current expectations, or historical results to differ from those previously reported due to the adoption of accounting standards on a retrospective basis. Such changes may also affect our regulatory capital and ratios. For example, the introduction of the expected credit loss (ECL) framework under IFRS 9 in 2018 fundamentally changed how credit risk arising from loans, loan commitments, guarantees and certain revocable facilities is accounted for. Under the regime, credit loss expenses may increase rapidly at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit impairments (stage 3), as well as higher ECL from stages 1 and 2, only gradually diminishing once the economic outlook improves. As we observed in 2020, this effect may be more pronounced in a deteriorating economic environment. Substantial increases in ECL could exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely affect our CET1 capital and regulatory capital ratios.\n\n## We may be unable to maintain our capital strength\n\nCapital strength enables us to grow our businesses and absorb increases in regulatory and capital requirements. It reassures our clients and stakeholders, allows us to maintain our capital return policy and contributes to our credit ratings. Our capital ratios are driven primarily by RWA, the leverage ratio denominator and eligible capital, all of which may fluctuate based on a number of factors, some of which are outside our control. Our ability to maintain our capital ratios is subject to numerous risks, including\n\nthe financial results of our businesses, the effect of changes to capital standards, methodologies and interpretations that may adversely affect the calculation of our CET1 ratios, the imposition of risk add-ons or capital buffers, and the application of additional capital, liquidity and similar requirements to subsidiaries. The results of our businesses may be adversely affected by events arising from other risk factors described herein. In some cases, such as litigation and regulatory risk and operational risk events, losses may be sudden and large. These risks could reduce the amount of capital available for return to shareholders and hinder our ability to achieve our capital returns target of a progressive cash dividend coupled with a share repurchase program.\n\nOur eligible capital may be reduced by losses recognized within net profit or other comprehensive income. Eligible capital may also be reduced for other reasons, including acquisitions which change the level of goodwill, changes in temporary differences related to deferred tax assets included in capital, adverse currency movements affecting the value of equity, prudential adjustments that may be required due to the valuation uncertainty associated with certain types of positions, changes in regulatory interpretations on the inclusion or exclusion of items contributing to our shareholders equity in regulatory capital, and changes in the value of certain pension fund assets and liabilities or in the interest rate and other assumptions used to calculate the changes in  our  net  defined  benefit  obligation  recognized  in  other comprehensive income.\n\nRWA are driven by our business activities, by changes in the risk profile  of  our  exposures,  by  changes  in  our  foreign  currency exposures and foreign exchange rates, and by regulation. For instance, substantial market volatility, a widening of credit spreads, adverse currency movements,  increased counterparty risk, deterioration in the economic environment or increased operational risk could result in an increase in RWA. We have significantly reduced our market risk and credit risk RWA in recent years. However,  increases  in  operational  risk  RWA,  particularly  those arising  from  litigation,  regulatory  and  similar  matters,  and regulatory changes in the calculation of RWA, as well as regulatory add-ons to RWA, have offset a substantial portion of this reduction. Changes in the calculation of RWA, the imposition of additional supplemental  RWA  charges  or  multipliers  applied  to  certain exposures  and  other  methodology  changes,  as  well  as  the implementation of the capital standards promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which are proposed to take effect in 2023, are expected to increase our RWA.\n\nThe  leverage  ratio  is  a  balance  sheet-driven  measure  and therefore limits balance sheet-intensive activities, such as lending, more than activities that are less balance sheet intensive, and it may constrain our business even if we satisfy other risk-based capital requirements. Our leverage ratio denominator is driven by, among other things, the level of client activity, including deposits and loans, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other market factors. Many of these factors are wholly or partly outside of our control.",

        "page_content": "## The effect of taxes on our financial results is significantly influenced by tax law changes and reassessments of our deferred tax assets\n\nOur effective tax rate is highly sensitive to our performance, our expectation of future profitability and any potential increases or decreases in statutory tax rates, such as any potential increase in the US federal corporate tax rate. Further, based on prior years' tax  losses,  we  have  recognized  deferred  tax  assets  (DTAs) reflecting the probable recoverable level based on future taxable profit as informed by our business plans. If our performance is expected to produce diminished taxable profit in future years, particularly in the US, we may be required to write down all or a portion of the currently recognized DTAs through the income statement in excess of anticipated amortization. This would have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate in the year in which any  write-downs  are  taken.  Conversely,  if  we  expect  the performance of entities in which we have unrecognized tax losses to improve, particularly in the US or the UK, we could potentially recognize additional DTAs. The effect of doing so would be to reduce our effective tax rate in years in which additional DTAs are recognized and to increase our effective tax rate in future years. Our effective tax rate is also sensitive to any future reductions in statutory tax rates, particularly in the US, which would cause the expected future tax benefit from items such as tax loss carryforwards in the affected locations to diminish in value. This, in turn, would cause a write-down of the associated DTAs. For example, the reduction in the US federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% introduced by the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a USD 2.9 billion net write-down in the Group's DTAs in the fourth quarter of 2017. Conversely, an increase in US corporate tax rates would result in an increase in the Group's DTAs.\n\nWe generally revalue our DTAs in the fourth quarter of the financial year based on a reassessment of future profitability taking into account our updated business plans. We consider the performance of our businesses and the accuracy of historical forecasts, tax rates and  other  factors  in  evaluating  the recoverability of our DTAs, including the remaining tax loss carryforward period and our assessment of expected future taxable profits over the life of DTAs. Estimating future profitability is inherently  subjective  and  is  particularly  sensitive  to  future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict.\n\nOur results in past years have demonstrated that changes in the recognition of DTAs can have a very significant effect on our reported results. Any future change in the manner in which UBS remeasures DTAs could affect UBS's effective tax rate, particularly in the year in which the change is made.\n\nOur full-year effective tax rate could change if aggregate tax expenses in respect of profits from branches and subsidiaries without loss coverage differ from what is expected, or if branches and subsidiaries generate tax losses that we cannot benefit from through the income statement. In particular, losses at entities or branches that cannot offset for tax purposes taxable profits in other group entities, and which do not result in additional DTA recognition, may increase our effective tax rate. In addition, tax laws or the tax authorities in countries where we have undertaken\n\nlegal  structure  changes  may  cause  entities  to  be  subject  to taxation as permanent establishments or may prevent the transfer of tax losses incurred in one legal entity to newly organized or reorganized subsidiaries or affiliates or may impose limitations on the utilization of tax losses that relate to businesses formerly conducted by the transferor. Were this to occur in situations where there were also limited planning opportunities to utilize the tax losses in the originating entity, the DTAs associated with such tax losses may be required to be written down through the income statement.\n\nChanges in tax law may materially affect our effective tax rate, and, in some cases, may substantially affect the profitability of certain activities. In addition, statutory and regulatory changes, as well as changes to the way in which courts and tax authorities interpret tax laws, including assertions that we are required to pay taxes in a jurisdiction as a result of activities connected to that jurisdiction  constituting  a  permanent  establishment  or  similar theory, and changes in our assessment of uncertain tax positions, could cause the amount of taxes we ultimately pay to materially differ from the amount accrued.\n\n## Strategy, management and operational risks\n\n## Operational risks affect our business\n\nOur businesses depend on our ability to process a large number of transactions, many of which are complex, across multiple and diverse markets  in  different currencies, to comply  with requirements of many different legal and regulatory regimes to which we are subject and to prevent, or promptly detect and stop, unauthorized, fictitious or fraudulent transactions. We also rely on access to, and on the functioning of, systems maintained by third parties, including clearing systems, exchanges, information processors and central counterparties. Any failure of our or thirdparty systems could have an adverse effect on us. These risks may be greater as we deploy newer technologies, such as blockchain, or products that rely on these technologies. Our operational risk management and control systems and processes are designed to help ensure that the risks associated with our activities - including those arising from process error, failed execution, misconduct, unauthorized  trading,  fraud,  system  failures,  financial  crime, cyberattacks, breaches of information security, inadequate or ineffective access controls and failure of security and physical protection - are appropriately controlled. If our internal controls fail or prove ineffective in identifying and remedying these risks, we could suffer operational failures that might result in material losses,  such  as  the  substantial  loss  we  incurred  from  the unauthorized trading incident announced in September 2011.\n\nAs a significant proportion of our staff have been and will continue working from outside the offices as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced, and will continue to face, new challenges and operational risks, including maintenance of supervisory and surveillance controls, as well as increased fraud and data security risks. While we have taken measures to manage these risks, such measures have never been tested on the scale or duration that we are currently experiencing, and there is risk that these measures will prove not to have been effective in the current unprecedented operating environment.",

        "page_content": "We use automation as part of our efforts to improve efficiency, reduce the risk of error and improve our client experience. We intend to expand the use of robotic processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence to further these goals. Use of these tools presents their own risks, including the need for effective design and testing; the quality of the data used for development and operation of machine learning and artificial intelligence tools may adversely affect their functioning and result in errors and other operational risks.\n\nFor financial institutions, cybersecurity risks have increased due to the widespread use of digital technologies, cloud computing and mobile devices to conduct financial business and transactions. In addition, cyberattacks by hackers, terrorists, criminal organizations, nation states and extremists have also increased in frequency and sophistication. Current geopolitical tensions also may lead to increased risk of cyberattack from foreign state actors. In particular, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of significant sanctions on Russia by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others may result in an increase in the risk of cyberattacks.\n\nWe and other financial services firms have been subject to breaches of security and to cyber- and other forms of attack, some of which are sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to gain access to confidential information or systems, disrupt service or destroy  data.  These  attacks  may  be  attempted  through  the introduction of viruses or malware, phishing and other forms of social engineering, distributed denial of service attacks and other means. These attempts may occur directly, or using equipment or security passwords of our employees, third-party service providers or  other  users.  In  addition  to  external  attacks,  we  have experienced loss of client data from failure by employees and others  to  follow  internal  policies  and  procedures  and  from misappropriation of our data by employees and others. We may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems  or  data  and  our  preventative  measures  may  not  be effective to prevent an attack or a security breach. In the event of a security breach, notwithstanding our preventative measures, we may not immediately detect a particular breach or attack. Once a particular attack is detected, time may be required to investigate and assess the nature and extent of the attack. A successful breach or circumvention of security of our systems or data could have  significant negative  consequences  for  us,  including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information concerning us or our customers, damage to our systems, financial losses for us or our customers, violations of data privacy and similar laws, litigation exposure and damage to our reputation.  We  may  be  subject  to  enforcement  actions  as regulatory focus on cybersecurity increases and regulators have announced new rules, guidance and initiatives on ransomware and other cybersecurity-related issues.\n\nWe are subject to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the protection of client and personal data, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Ensuring that we comply with applicable laws and regulations when we collect, use  and  transfer  personal  information  requires  substantial resources and may affect the ways in which we conduct our\n\nbusiness. In the event that we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be exposed to regulatory fines and penalties and other sanctions. We may also incur such penalties if our vendors or other service providers or clients or counterparties fail to comply with these laws or to maintain appropriate controls over protected data. In addition, any loss or exposure of client or other data may adversely  damage  our  reputation  and  adversely  affect  our business.\n\nA major focus of US and other countries' governmental policies relating  to  financial  institutions  in  recent  years  has  been  on fighting  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing.  We  are required to maintain effective policies, procedures and controls to detect,  prevent  and  report  money  laundering  and  terrorist financing, and to verify the identity of our clients under the laws of many of the countries in which we operate. We are also subject to laws and regulations related to corrupt and illegal payments to government officials by others, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws and regulations. Notwithstanding this, US regulators have found deficiencies in the design and operation of anti-money laundering programs in our US operations. We have undertaken a significant program to address these regulatory findings with the objective of fully meeting  regulatory expectations for our programs. Failure to maintain and implement adequate  programs  to  combat  money  laundering,  terrorist financing or corruption, or any failure of our programs in these areas,  could  have  serious  consequences  both  from  legal enforcement action and from damage to our reputation. Frequent changes in sanctions imposed and increasingly complex sanctions imposed on countries, entities and individuals, as exemplified by the breadth and scope of the sanctions imposed in relation the Russian invasion of Ukraine, increase our cost of monitoring and complying with sanctions requirements and increase the risk that we will not identify in a timely manner client activity that is subject to a sanction.\n\nAs a result of new and changed regulatory requirements and the changes we have made in our legal structure, the volume, frequency and complexity of our regulatory and other reporting has  remained  elevated.  Regulators  have  also  significantly increased expectations regarding our internal reporting and data aggregation, as well as management reporting. We have incurred and continue to incur significant costs to implement infrastructure to meet these requirements. Failure to meet external reporting requirements accurately and in a timely manner or failure to meet regulatory expectations of internal reporting, data aggregation and management reporting could result in enforcement action or other adverse consequences for us.\n\nIn addition, despite the contingency plans that we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we operate. This may include a disruption due to natural disasters, pandemics, civil unrest, war or terrorism and involve electrical, communications, transportation or other services that we use or that are used by third parties with whom we conduct business.",

        "page_content": "## We may not be successful in the ongoing execution of our strategic plans\n\nWe  have  transformed  UBS  to  focus  on  our  Global  Wealth Management business and our universal bank in Switzerland, complemented by Asset Management and a significantly smaller and more capital-efficient Investment Bank; we have substantially reduced the risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio denominator usage in Group Functions; and made significant cost reductions. Risk remains that going forward we may not succeed in executing our strategy or achieving our performance targets, or may be delayed  in  doing  so.  Macroeconomic  conditions,  geopolitical uncertainty,  changes  to  regulatory  requirements  and  the continuing costs of meeting these requirements have prompted us to adapt our targets and ambitions in the past and we may need to do so again in the future.\n\nTo achieve our strategic plans, we expect to continue to make significant  expenditures  on  technology  and  infrastructure  to improve client experience, improve and further enable digital offerings and increase efficiency. We also may seek to implement our strategy through acquisitions or strategic partnerships to expand or improve our product offerings or target additional client segments. Our investments in new technology and our acquisitions and strategic partnerships may not fully achieve our objectives or improve our ability to attract and retain customers. In addition, we face competition in providing digitally enabled offerings from both existing competitors and new financial service providers in various portions of the value chain. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for e-commerce firms and other companies to offer products and services that were traditionally offered only by banks. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide digitally based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice at a low cost to their customers. We may have to lower our prices, or risk losing customers as a result. Our ability to develop and implement competitive digitally enabled offerings and processes will be an important factor in our ability to compete.\n\nAs part of our strategy, we seek to improve our operating efficiency, in part by controlling our costs. We may not be able to identify feasible cost reduction opportunities that are consistent with our business goals and cost reductions may be realized later or may be smaller than we anticipate. Higher temporary and permanent regulatory costs and higher business demand than anticipated have partly offset cost reductions and delayed the achievement of our past cost reduction targets, and we could continue to be challenged in the execution of our ongoing efforts to improve operating efficiency.\n\nChanges  in  our  workforce  as  a  result  of  outsourcing, nearshoring,  offshoring,  insourcing  or  staff  reductions  or, changes which arise from the introduction of work from home or other flexible ways of working or agile work methodologies may introduce new operational risks that, if not effectively addressed, could affect our ability to achieve cost and other benefits from such changes, or could result in operational losses.\n\nAs we implement effectiveness and efficiency programs, we may  also  experience  unintended  consequences,  such  as  the unintended loss or degradation of capabilities that we need in order to maintain our competitive position, achieve our targeted returns or meet existing or new regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\n## We depend on our risk management and control processes to avoid or limit potential losses in our businesses\n\nControlled risk-taking is a major part of the business of a financial services firm. Some losses from risk-taking activities are inevitable, but to be successful over time, we must balance the risks we take against  the  returns  generated.  Therefore,  we  must  diligently identify, assess, manage and control our risks, not only in normal market conditions but also as they might develop under more extreme, stressed conditions, when concentrations of exposures can lead to severe losses.\n\nWe have not always been able to prevent serious losses arising from risk management failures and extreme or sudden market events. We recorded substantial losses on fixed-income trading positions in the 2008 financial crisis, in the unauthorized trading incident in 2011 and, more recently, positions resulting from the default of a US prime brokerage client. We revise and strengthen our risk management and control frameworks to seek to address identified shortcomings. Nonetheless, we could suffer further losses in the future if, for example:\n\n- -we do not fully identify the risks in our portfolio, in particular risk concentrations and correlated risks;\n- -our assessment of the risks identified, or our response to negative trends, proves to be untimely, inadequate, insufficient or incorrect;\n- -our  risk  models  prove  insufficient  to  predict  the  scale  of financial risks the bank faces;\n- -markets move in ways that we do not expect - in terms of their speed, direction, severity or correlation - and our ability to manage  risks  in  the  resulting  environment  is,  therefore, affected;\n- -third parties to whom we have credit exposure or whose securities we hold are severely affected by events and we suffer defaults and impairments beyond the level implied by our risk assessment; or\n- -collateral or other security provided by our counterparties and clients proves inadequate to cover their obligations at the time of default.\n\nWe  also  hold  legacy  risk  positions,  primarily  in  Group Functions,  that,  in  many  cases,  are  illiquid  and  may  again deteriorate in value.\n\nWe also manage risk on behalf of our clients. The performance of assets we hold for our clients may be adversely affected by the same factors mentioned above. If clients suffer losses or the performance of their assets held with us is not in line with relevant benchmarks against which clients assess investment performance, we may suffer reduced fee income and a decline in assets under management, or withdrawal of mandates.\n\nInvestment positions, such as equity investments made as part of strategic initiatives and seed investments made at the inception of funds that we manage, may also be affected by market risk factors. These investments are often not liquid and generally are intended or required to be held beyond a normal trading horizon. Deteriorations in the fair value of these positions would have a negative effect on our earnings.",

        "page_content": "## We may not be successful in implementing changes in our wealth management businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions\n\nIn recent years, inflows from lower-margin segments and markets have been replacing outflows from higher-margin segments and markets,  in  particular  for  cross-border  clients.  This  dynamic, combined with changes in client product preferences as a result of which low-margin products account for a larger share of our revenues than in the past, has put downward pressure on Global Wealth Management's margins.\n\nWe are exposed to possible outflows of client assets in our asset-gathering businesses and  to  changes  affecting  the profitability of  Global  Wealth  Management,  in  particular. Initiatives that we may implement to overcome the effects of changes in the business environment on our profitability, balance sheet and capital positions may not succeed in counteracting those  effects  and  may  cause  net  new  money  outflows  and reductions in client deposits, as happened with our balance sheet and capital optimization program in 2015. There is no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to offset the adverse effect of these or similar trends and developments.\n\n## We may be unable to identify or capture revenue or competitive opportunities, or retain and attract qualified employees\n\nThe  financial  services  industry  is  characterized  by  intense competition,  continuous  innovation,  restrictive,  detailed,  and sometimes fragmented regulation and ongoing consolidation. We face competition at the level of local markets and individual business lines, and from global financial institutions that are comparable to us in their size and breadth, as well as competition from new technology-based market entrants, which may not be subject  to  the  same  level  of  regulation.  Barriers  to  entry  in individual markets and pricing levels are being eroded by new technology. We expect these trends to continue and competition to increase. Our competitive strength and market position could be  eroded  if  we  are  unable  to  identify  market  trends  and developments, do not respond to such trends and developments by devising and implementing adequate business strategies, do not adequately develop or update our technology including our digital channels and tools, or are unable to attract or retain the qualified people needed.\n\nThe amount and structure of our employee compensation is affected not only by our business results, but also by competitive factors and regulatory considerations.\n\nIn response to the demands of various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities and shareholders, and in order to better align the interests of our staff with other stakeholders, we have increased average deferral periods for stock awards, expanded forfeiture provisions and, to a more limited extent, introduced clawback  provisions  for  certain  awards  linked  to  business performance. We have also introduced individual caps on the proportion of fixed to variable pay for the Group Executive Board (GEB) members, as well as certain other employees.\n\nConstraints  on  the  amount  or  structure  of  employee compensation, higher levels of deferral, performance conditions and other circumstances triggering the forfeiture of unvested awards may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract key employees, particularly where we compete with companies that are not subject to these constraints. The loss of key staff and the inability to attract qualified replacements  could  seriously\n\ncompromise our ability to execute our strategy and to successfully improve our operating and control environment, and could affect our business performance. Swiss law requires that shareholders approve the compensation of the Board of Directors (the BoD) and the GEB each year. If our shareholders fail to approve the compensation for the GEB or the BoD, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain experienced directors and our senior management.\n\n## Our reputation is critical to our success\n\nOur reputation is critical to the success of our strategic plans, business  and  prospects.  Reputational  damage  is  difficult  to reverse,  and  improvements  tend  to  be  slow  and  difficult  to measure. In the past, our reputation has been adversely affected by our losses during the financial crisis, investigations into our cross-border  private  banking  services,  criminal  resolutions  of LIBOR-related and foreign exchange matters, as well as other matters. We believe that reputational damage as a result of these events was an important factor in our loss of clients and client assets across our asset-gathering businesses. New events that cause reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, as well as our ability to achieve our strategic goals and financial targets.\n\nAs UBS Group AG is a holding company, its operating results, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and other distributions and / or to pay its obligations in the future depend on funding, dividends and other distributions received directly or indirectly from its subsidiaries, which may be subject to restrictions\n\nUBS Group AG's ability to pay dividends and other distributions and to pay its obligations in the future will depend on the level of funding, dividends and other distributions, if any, received from UBS AG and other subsidiaries. The ability of such subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, to UBS Group AG may be restricted as a result of several factors, including restrictions in financing agreements and the requirements of applicable  law  and  regulatory,  fiscal  or  other  restrictions.  In particular,  UBS  Group  AG's  direct  and  indirect  subsidiaries, including UBS AG, UBS Switzerland AG, UBS Americas Holding LLC and UBS Europe SE, are subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend payments, authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to UBS Group AG, or could affect their ability to repay any loans made to, or other investments in, such subsidiary by UBS Group AG or another member of the Group. For example, in the early stages of the COVID-19  pandemic,  the  European  Central  Bank  ordered  all banks under its supervision to cease dividend distributions and the Federal Reserve Board has limited capital distributions by bank holding companies  and  intermediate  holding  companies. Restrictions and regulatory actions of this kind could impede access  to  funds  that  UBS  Group  AG  may  need  to  meet  its obligations or to pay dividends to shareholders. In addition, UBS Group AG's right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary's liquidation or reorganization is subject to all prior claims of the subsidiary's creditors.\n\nOur capital instruments may contractually prevent UBS Group AG from proposing the distribution of dividends to shareholders, other  than  in  the  form  of  shares  and  from  engaging  in repurchases  of  shares,  if  we  do  not  pay  interest  on  these instruments.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, UBS Group AG may guarantee some of the payment obligations of certain of the Group's subsidiaries from time to time. These guarantees may require UBS Group AG to provide substantial funds or assets to subsidiaries or their creditors or counterparties at a time when UBS Group AG is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.\n\nThe credit ratings of UBS Group AG or its subsidiaries used for funding purposes could be lower than the ratings of the Group's operating subsidiaries, which may adversely affect the market value of the securities and other obligations of UBS Group AG or those subsidiaries on a standalone basis.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\n## Liquidity and funding management are critical to UBS's ongoing performance\n\nThe viability of our business depends on the availability of funding sources, and our success depends on our ability to obtain funding at times, in amounts, for tenors and at rates that enable us to efficiently support our asset base in all market conditions. Our funding sources have generally been stable, but could change in the  future  because  of,  among  other  things,  general  market disruptions or widening credit spreads, which could also influence the cost of funding. A substantial part of our liquidity and funding requirements  are  met  using  short-term  unsecured  funding sources, including retail and wholesale deposits and the regular issuance of money market securities. A change in the availability of short-term funding could occur quickly.\n\nThe addition of loss-absorbing debt as a component of capital requirements, the regulatory requirements to maintain minimum TLAC at UBS's holding company and at subsidiaries, as well as the power of resolution authorities to bail in TLAC and other debt obligations,  and  uncertainty  as  to  how  such  powers  will  be exercised, will increase our cost of funding and could potentially increase the total amount of funding required, in the absence of other changes in our business.\n\nReductions  in  our  credit  ratings  may  adversely  affect  the market value of the securities and other obligations and increase our funding costs, in particular with regard to funding from wholesale unsecured sources, and could affect the availability of certain kinds of funding. In addition, as experienced in connection with Moody's downgrade of UBS AG's long-term debt rating in June 2012, rating downgrades can require us to post additional collateral  or  make  additional  cash  payments  under  trading agreements. Our credit ratings, together with our capital strength and  reputation,  also  contribute  to  maintaining  client  and counterparty confidence, and it is possible that rating changes could influence the performance of some of our businesses.\n\nThe requirement to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio of highquality liquid assets to estimated stressed short-term net cash outflows, and other similar liquidity and funding requirements, oblige us to maintain high levels of overall liquidity, limit our ability to optimize interest income and expense, make certain lines of business less attractive and reduce our overall ability to generate profits. In particular, UBS AG is subjected to increased liquidity coverage requirements under the direction of FINMA. Regulators may consider it necessary to increase these requirements in light of the anticipated economic stresses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements are intended to ensure that we are not overly reliant on short-term funding and that we have sufficient longterm funding for illiquid assets. The relevant calculations make assumptions about the relative likelihood and amount of outflows of funding and available sources of additional funding in marketwide and firm-specific stress situations. There can be no assurance that in an actual stress situation our funding outflows would not exceed the assumed amounts.",

Operating income increased by USD 3,152 million, or 10%, to USD 35,542 million, mainly reflecting a USD 3,201 million increase in net fee and commission  income.  Net  credit  loss  releases  were  USD 148 million, compared with net credit loss expenses of USD 694 million in 2020. This was partly offset by USD 624 million lower other income and a USD 267 million decrease in total combined net  interest  income  and  other  net  income  from  financial instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss. Operating expenses increased by USD 1,823 million, or 8%, to USD 26,058  million.  This  increase  was  mainly  driven  by USD 1,163  million  higher  personnel  expenses  and  USD 668 million higher general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Operating income\n\nOperating income increased by USD 3,152 million, or 10%, to USD 35,542 million.\n\n## Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nTotal combined net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss decreased by USD 267 million to USD 12,555 million.\n\nThe  Investment  Bank  decreased  by  USD 576  million  to USD 5,067 million, largely driven by a USD 713 million decrease in our Financing business in Global Markets, primarily reflecting a loss of USD 861 million incurred in the first half of 2021 on the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business, partly  offset  by  higher  capital  markets  financing  revenues. Derivatives & Solutions increased by USD 169 million, mainly due to higher revenues from equity derivatives, partly offset by lower income from foreign exchange, rates and credit products.\n\nGroup  Functions  recognized  negative  income  of  USD 397 million, compared with negative income of USD 302 million. This was largely due to USD 113 million lower net income in Group Treasury,  mainly  reflecting  net  effects  related  to  accounting asymmetries, including hedge accounting ineffectiveness, partly offset by lower negative revenues related to centralized Group Treasury risk management services. In addition, 2021 included valuation gains of USD 58 million on auction rate securities in Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, compared with valuation losses of USD 9 million in the prior year.\n\nGlobal Wealth Management increased by USD 302 million to USD 5,341 million, mainly driven by higher net interest income, largely reflecting growth in lending revenues from higher volumes and margins, partly offset by lower deposit revenues, mainly due to  lower  US  dollar  interest  rates  and  despite  higher  deposit volumes.\n\nPersonal & Corporate Banking increased by USD 98 million to USD 2,557 million, mainly due to higher net interest income, driven by proactive deposit management.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 3 Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at

It also includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to vesting requirements. 4 4 Consists of expenses related to contractors, social security, post-employment benefit plans, and other personnel expenses. Refer to 'Note 6 Personnel expenses' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information. 5 5 During 2020, UBS modified the conditions for continued vesting of certain outstanding deferred compensation awards for qualifying employees, resulting in an expense of approximately USD 280 million, of which USD 240 million is disclosed within Variable compensation and USD 40 million within Other personnel expenses in this table.\n\n## General and administrative expenses\n\nGeneral  and  administrative  expenses  increased  by  USD 668 million to USD 5,553 million, mainly driven by a USD 740 million (EUR 650 million) increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter and USD 106 million higher IT expenses. These effects were partly offset by lower consulting fees and outsourcing costs.\n\nNet expenses for the UK and German bank levies were USD 58 million in 2021 and included a USD 16 million credit related to prior years. In 2020, net expenses for the UK and German bank levies were USD 55 million and included a USD 27 million credit related to prior years.\n\nWe  believe  that  the  industry  continues  to  operate  in  an environment  in  which  expenses  associated  with  litigation, regulatory  and  similar  matters  will  remain  elevated  for  the foreseeable future, and we continue to be exposed to a number of significant claims and regulatory matters. The outcome of many of these matters, the timing of a resolution, and the potential effects of resolutions on our future business, financial results or financial condition are extremely difficult to predict.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 7 General and administrative expenses' and 'Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Depreciation, amortization and impairment\n\nDepreciation,  amortization  and  impairment  of  non-financial assets decreased by USD 8 million to USD 2,118 million, mainly driven by lower impairment expenses on internally generated software, a decrease in depreciation expenses related to leased properties and lower amortization of intangible assets, partly offset by higher depreciation expenses on internally generated software.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 12 Property, equipment and software' and 'Note  13 Goodwill and intangible assets' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information",

        "page_content": "## Tax\n\nIncome tax expenses of USD 1,998 million were recognized for the Group in 2021, representing an effective tax rate of 21.1%, compared with USD 1,583 million for 2020, which represented an effective tax rate of 19.4%. The income tax expenses for 2021 included Swiss tax expenses of USD 714 million and non-Swiss tax expenses of USD 1,284 million.\n\nThe  Swiss  tax  expenses  included  current  tax  expenses  of USD 680 million related to taxable profits of UBS Switzerland AG and other Swiss entities. They also included deferred tax expenses of  USD 34  million,  which  reflect  movements  in  temporary differences.\n\nThe non-Swiss tax expenses included current tax expenses of USD 884 million related to taxable profits earned by non-Swiss subsidiaries  and  branches  and  net  deferred  tax  expenses  of USD 400 million. Expenses of USD 734 million, which primarily related  to  the  amortization  of  deferred  tax  assets  (DTAs) previously recognized in relation to tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences of UBS Americas Inc., were partly offset by a benefit of USD 334 million in respect of the remeasurement  of DTAs. This benefit included upward revaluations  of  DTAs  of  USD 152  million  for  certain  entities, primarily in connection with our business planning process. It also included USD 113 million in respect of additional DTA recognition that primarily related to the contribution of real estate assets by UBS AG to UBS Americas Inc. and UBS Financial Services Inc., which allowed the full recognition of DTAs in respect of the associated  historic  real  estate  costs  that  were  previously capitalized for US tax purposes under elections that were made in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, it included USD 69 million in respect of an increase in the expected value of future tax deductions for deferred compensation awards, due to an increase in the Group's share price during the year.\n\nThe pre-tax expense that was recognized in the year in respect of the increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter did not result in any tax benefit.\n\nExcluding any potential effects from the remeasurement of DTAs in connection with next year's business planning process and any potential US corporate tax rate changes or other material jurisdictional statutory tax rate changes that could be enacted during the year, we expect a tax rate for 2022 of around 24%.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 8 Income taxes' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information\n\n## Total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders\n\nIn 2021, total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders was USD 5,106 million, reflecting net profit of USD 7,457 million and negative other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, of USD 2,351 million.\n\nOCI related to cash flow hedges was negative USD 1,675 million, mainly reflecting net gains on hedging instruments that were reclassified from OCI to the income statement as the hedged forecast cash flows affected profit or loss.\n\nForeign  currency  translation  OCI  was  negative  USD 535 million, mainly due to the weakening of the euro (7%), the Swiss franc (3%) and the Japanese yen (10%) against the US dollar.\n\nOCI associated with financial assets measured at fair value through OCI was negative USD 157 million, primarily reflecting net unrealized losses of USD 203 million following increases in the relevant US dollar long-term interest rates.\n\nOCI related to cost of hedging was negative USD 26 million, mainly driven by a tightening of the US dollar / euro cross-currency basis that decreased the fair value of the cross-currency swaps.\n\nDefined benefit plan OCI, net of tax, was negative USD 5 million. Total net pre-tax OCI related to the Swiss pension plan was negative USD 336 million. This was mainly driven by an extraordinary  employer  contribution  of  USD 254  million  that increased the gross plan assets and a pension plan curtailment of USD 80 million that reduced the DBO against profit or loss. These effects led to an offsetting OCI loss, as no net pension asset could be recognized on the balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 due to  the  asset  ceiling.  As  announced  in  2018,  UBS  agreed  to mitigate the effects from changes to the Swiss pension plan implemented in 2019 by contributing up to CHF 720 million (USD 790 million at the closing exchange rate as of 31 December 2021)  in  three  installments  in  2020,  2021  and  2022.  The extraordinary contribution of USD 254 million in the first quarter of 2021 reflected the second installment paid (first installment in the first quarter of 2020: USD 235 million).\n\nTotal pre-tax OCI related to our non-Swiss pension plans was positive USD 339 million, mainly driven by the UK pension plan, which recorded positive net pre-tax OCI of USD 207 million. The positive OCI in the UK plan reflected gains of USD 277 million due to a positive return on plan assets, partly offset by losses of USD 71  million  from  remeasurement  of  the  DBO.  The  DBO remeasurement effect was mainly driven by a loss of USD 316 million due to an increase in the applicable inflation rate and a USD 59  million  experience  loss  representing  the  effects  of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what actually occurred, partly offset by a USD 319 million gain due to an increase in the applicable discount rate.\n\nOCI related to own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value was positive USD 46 million, primarily reflecting effects from time decay.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Statement of comprehensive income' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 21 Fair value measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 26 Hedge accounting' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about OCI related to defined benefit plans",

        "page_content": "## Sensitivity to interest rate movements\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, we estimate that a parallel shift in yield curves by +100 basis points could lead to a combined increase in annual net interest income of approximately USD 1.8 billion in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking in the first year after such a shift. Of this increase, approximately USD 1.2 billion and USD 0.2 billion would result from changes in US dollar and Swiss franc interest rates, respectively. A parallel shift in yield curves by -100 basis points could lead to a combined decrease in annual net interest income of approximately USD 0.8 billion in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking in the first year after such a shift, predominantly driven by positions denominated in US dollars.\n\nThese estimates are based on a hypothetical scenario of an immediate change in interest rates, equal across all currencies and relative to implied forward rates as of 31 December 2021 applied to our banking book. These estimates further assume no change to balance sheet size and structure, constant foreign exchange rates and no specific management action.\n\n## Seasonal characteristics\n\nOur  revenues  may  show  seasonal  patterns,  notably  in  the Investment  Bank  and  transaction-based  revenues  for  Global Wealth  Management,  and  typically  reflect  the  highest  client activity levels in the first quarter, with lower levels throughout the rest of the year, especially during the summer months and the end-of-year holiday season.\n\n## Key figures\n\nBelow we provide an overview of selected key figures of the Group. For further information about key figures related to capital management, refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio was 73.6%, compared with 73.3%, reflecting higher operating expenses, with a partly offsetting effect driven by an increase in operating income. The cost / income ratio is measured based on income before credit loss expenses or releases.\n\n## Common equity tier 1 capital\n\nCommon equity tier 1 (CET1) capital increased by USD 5.4 billion to USD 45.3 billion, mainly as a result of operating profit before tax  of  USD 9.5  billion,  a  USD 0.5  billion  increase  in  eligible deferred tax assets on temporary differences, a USD 0.4 billion decrease in deduction of goodwill resulting from the sale of our remaining minority investment in Clearstream Fund Centre AG (previously Fondcenter AG) and an increase of USD 0.2 billion related to the launch of our new operational partnership entity with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. These effects were partly offset by dividend accruals of USD 1.7 billion, current tax expenses of USD 1.6 billion, share repurchases under our share repurchase program of USD 0.6 billion, negative foreign currency\n\neffects of USD 0.6 billion, compensation- and own share-related capital components of USD 0.4 billion, and negative effects from defined benefit plans of USD 0.2 billion.\n\nOur share repurchases in 2021 decreased CET1 capital by USD 0.6 billion, reflecting shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs of USD 2.6 billion, partly offset by the use of the capital reserve for potential share repurchases of USD 2.0 billion. The capital reserve for potential share repurchases was fully utilized during 2021.\n\n## Return on CET1 capital\n\nOur return on CET1 capital (RoCET1) was 17.5%, compared with 17.4%,  reflecting  a  USD 900  million  increase  in  net  profit attributable to shareholders, with a partly offsetting effect driven by USD 5.0 billion higher average CET1 capital.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nRisk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  increased  by  USD 13.1  billion  to USD 302.2  billion,  primarily  driven  by  increases  of  USD 12.0 billion in credit and counterparty credit risk RWA, USD 1.0 billion in operational risk RWA and USD 0.9 billion in non-counterpartyrelated risk. These increases were partly offset by a decrease of USD 0.8 billion in market risk RWA.\n\n## Common equity tier 1 capital ratio\n\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased 1.2 percentage points to 15.0%, reflecting a USD 5.4 billion increase in CET1 capital that was partly offset by the aforementioned increase in RWA.\n\n## Leverage ratio denominator\n\nThe leverage ratio denominator (the LRD) increased by USD 32 billion (excluding the temporary exemption that applied from 25 March 2020 until 1 January 2021 and was granted by the Swiss  Financial  Market  Supervisory  Authority  (FINMA))  to USD 1,069 billion, driven by asset size and other movements of USD 54 billion, partly offset by a decrease due to currency effects of USD 23 billion.\n\n## Common equity tier 1 leverage ratio\n\nOur  CET1  leverage  ratio  increased  to  4.24%  from  3.85% (excluding the temporary exemption that applied from 25 March 2020 until 1 January 2021 and was granted by FINMA), as the aforementioned  USD 5.4  billion  increase  in  CET1  capital  was partly offset by the aforementioned increase in the LRD.\n\n## Going concern leverage ratio\n\nOur going concern leverage ratio increased to 5.7% from 5.4% (excluding the temporary exemption that applied from 25 March 2020 until 1 January 2021 and was granted by FINMA), as the USD 4.3 billion increase in our going concern capital was partly offset by the aforementioned increase in the LRD.\n\n## Personnel\n\nThe number of personnel employed as of 31 December 2021 was broadly stable at 71,385 (full-time equivalents), a net decrease of 166 compared with 31 December 2020.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 compared with 2020\n\n## Results\n\nProfit  before  tax  increased  by  USD 764  million,  or  19%,  to USD 4,783 million, driven by higher operating income, partly offset by higher operating expenses, which included a USD 657 million increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter.\n\n## Operating income\n\nTotal operating income increased by USD 2,404 million, or 14%, to USD 19,449 million, driven by increases across all operating income lines.\n\nNet  interest  income  increased  by  USD 217  million  to USD 4,244 million, mostly reflecting growth in loan revenues from higher volumes and margins, partly offset by lower deposit revenues, mainly due to lower US dollar interest rates and despite higher deposit volumes.\n\nRecurring net fee income increased by USD 1,798 million to USD 11,170  million,  primarily  driven  by  higher  average  feegenerating assets, reflecting positive market performance and net new fee-generating assets.\n\nTransaction-based income increased by USD 260 million to USD 3,836 million, reflecting higher levels of client activity in the Americas, EMEA and Switzerland.\n\nOther income increased by USD 9 million to USD 168 million, primarily driven by a gain of USD 100 million related to the sale of our domestic wealth management business in Austria to LGT. 2020 included a gain of USD 60 million from the sale of a majority stake in Fondcenter AG (now Clearstream Fund Centre AG).\n\nNet credit loss releases were USD 29 million, compared with net expenses of USD 88 million. Stage 1 and 2 credit loss releases were USD 28 million, largely resulting from a partial release of a post-model adjustment of USD 12 million during the year, as well as model updates. Stage 3 net credit loss releases were USD 1 million.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nTotal  operating  expenses  increased  by  USD 1,639  million  to USD 14,665 million. This was mainly driven by an increase in financial advisor variable compensation,  reflecting higher compensable  revenues,  and  by  the  aforementioned  USD 657 million increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter.\n\n## Pre-tax profit growth\n\nPre-tax profit growth in 2021 was 19.0%, compared with 18.3% in 2020. Our target range is 10-15% over the cycle.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe  cost  /  income  ratio  decreased  to  75.5%  from  76.0%, reflecting positive operating leverage.\n\n## Fee-generating assets\n\nFee-generating assets increased by USD 205 billion, or 16%, to USD 1,482  billion,  predominantly  driven  by  net  new  feegenerating assets of USD 106.9 billion, with inflows across all regions,  and  net  positive  market  performance  and  foreign currency effects of USD 98.0 billion.\n\n## Loans\n\nLoans  increased  by  USD 21.0  billion,  or  10%,  to  USD 234.1 billion, primarily driven by net new loans of USD 25.1 billion, partly offset by USD 3.0 billion from negative foreign exchange effects and USD 1.1 billion from the reclassification of loans to disposal groups held for sale in connection with the upcoming sales of our domestic wealth management business in Spain and UBS Swiss Financial Advisers AG. Net new loans were largely driven by an increase in Lombard loans and mortgages. Loan penetration was stable at 7.1% in 2021.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information",

The third quarter of 2020 included a CHF 17 million gain related to the sale of an equity investment.\n\nOther income increased by CHF 36 million to CHF 110 million, mostly driven by a gain of CHF 26 million from the sale of several small properties in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nNet credit loss releases were CHF 79 million, compared with net expenses of CHF 243 million. Stage 1 and 2 credit loss releases were CHF 57 million, largely resulting from a partial release of a post-model adjustment during the year, as well as model updates. Prior-year stage 1 and 2 net credit loss expenses were CHF 123 million, which mainly reflected expenses for selected exposures to large Swiss corporate clients, small and medium-sized entities, financial intermediaries, and, to a lesser extent, real estate. These modeled  expected  losses  were  predominantly  driven  by  the update to the forward-looking scenarios and their associated weightings, factoring in updated macroeconomic assumptions to reflect  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Stage 3  net releases were CHF 23 million, compared with net expenses of CHF 120  million,  which  included  expenses  of  CHF 54  million related  to  a  case  of  fraud  at  a  commodity  trade  finance counterparty.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by CHF 164 million, or 7%, to CHF 2,397 million, mostly driven by a CHF 76 million (USD 83 million) increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter, as well as higher investments in technology and higher variable compensation.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio slightly increased to 61.4% from 61.2%, reflecting  higher  operating  expenses,  partly  offset  by  higher income.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 compared with 2020\n\n## Results\n\nProfit  before  tax  decreased  by  USD 425  million,  or  29%,  to USD 1,030 million. This reflected a gain of USD 571 million from the sale of a majority stake in Fondcenter AG (now Clearstream Fund Centre AG) in the third quarter of 2020 and a gain of USD 37 million related to the sale of our remaining minority investment in Clearstream Fund Centre AG (previously Fondcenter AG)  to  Deutsche  B\u00f6rse  AG  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021. Excluding these gains, profit before tax increased by USD 109 million, or 12%, to USD 993 million, reflecting positive operating leverage.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 30 Changes in organization and acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and businesses' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the aforementioned sales\n\n## Operating income\n\nTotal operating income decreased by USD 358 million, or 12%, to USD 2,616 million. Excluding the aforementioned gains from sales, total operating income increased by USD 176 million, or 7%.\n\nNet management fees increased by USD 370 million, or 19%, to USD 2,320 million on a higher average invested asset base, reflecting a combination of a constructive market backdrop and strong net new money generation.\n\nPerformance fees decreased by USD 195 million to USD 260 million, mainly in our Hedge Fund Businesses and our Equities business, compared  with  the  particularly  high  levels  of performance fees in 2020.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by USD 67 million, or 4%, to USD 1,586 million, mainly driven by higher personnel expenses and foreign currency effects, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio was 60.6%, compared with 51.0% in 2020. Excluding the aforementioned gains from sales, the cost / income ratio was 61.5%, compared with 63.2% in 2020.\n\n## Invested assets\n\nInvested assets increased to USD 1,211 billion from USD 1,092 billion, reflecting positive market performance of USD 102 billion and net new money inflows of USD 45 billion, partly offset by negative foreign currency effects of USD 28 billion. Excluding money market flows, net new money was USD 48 billion.\n\n## Investment performance\n\n2021  saw  risk  assets  perform  strongly  and  subdued  market volatility.  Expansive  monetary  policy  supported  a  continued, broad economic recovery across the globe. Shortages in supplies to meet heightened global demand led to higher energy prices and strong inflation over the year, and central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, started to reconsider their future monetary policy.\n\nAs of year-end 2021, Morningstar assigned a four- or five-star rating to 64% of our retail and institutional funds (both actively managed and passive), on an assets under management (AuM)weighted basis. Furthermore, 55% of our actively managed openended retail funds and actively managed institutional AuM (which account in total for 44% of our relevant AuM) are ranked, on an AuM-weighted basis over a three-year investment period, above their respective peer median.\n\n## Investment performance as of 31 December 2021\n\n| In %                                                                            |   Total traditional  investments |   Equities |   Fixed income |   Multi-asset |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------|----------------|---------------|\n| % of UBS Asset Management fund assets rated as 4- or 5-star 1,2                 |                               64 |         66 |             65 |            49 |\n| % of UBS Asset Management above peer median over a 3-year investment period 2,3 |                               55 |         48 |             61 |            65 |",

Revenue increases in cash equities were partly offset by decreases from other products.\n\nDerivatives  &  Solutions  revenues  decreased  by  USD 187 million, or 5%, to USD 3,422 million, mainly due to the third quarter of 2020 including a USD 215 million gain from the sale of intellectual  property  rights  associated  with  the  Bloomberg Commodity Index family. Excluding that gain, revenues increased by USD 28 million, or 1%.\n\nFinancing revenues decreased by USD 695 million, or 42%, to USD 979 million, predominantly due to an USD 861 million loss incurred in the first half of 2021 on the default of a US-based client  of  our  prime  brokerage  business.  Excluding  that  loss, revenues increased by USD 166 million, or 10%.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 21 Fair value measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the loss in the prime brokerage business\n\nGlobal Markets Equities revenues increased by USD 79 million, or 2%, to USD 4,581 million. Equity derivatives and cash equities products revenues increased, while Financing revenues included the aforementioned loss in our prime brokerage business.\n\nGlobal Markets Foreign Exchange, Rates and Credit revenues decreased by USD 923 million, or 35%, to USD 1,715 million, compared with strong revenues in 2020.\n\n## Credit loss expense / release\n\nNet credit loss releases were USD 34 million, primarily related to stage 1 and 2 positions, resulting from model updates, as well as a partial net release of a post-model adjustment during the year. Prior-year net credit loss expenses were USD 305 million, driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses increased by USD 126 million, or 2%, to USD 6,858 million, largely driven by foreign currency effects.\n\n## Cost / income ratio\n\nThe cost / income ratio increased to 72.5% from 70.7%, as income decreased by 1% compared with a strong prior year, and operating expenses increased by 2%.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA) decreased by USD 2 billion, or 2%, to USD 92  billion,  primarily  due  to  a  USD 3  billion  decrease  in operational risk RWA and a USD 1 billion decrease in market risk RWA, partly offset by a USD 2 billion increase in credit risk RWA due to higher loans and loan commitments.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information\n\n## Leverage ratio denominator\n\nThe leverage ratio denominator increased by USD 4 billion, or 1%, to USD 319 billion, mainly reflecting a USD 9 billion increase in on-balance  sheet  exposures,  partly  offset  by  a  USD 4  billion decrease  in  derivative  and  securities  financing  transaction exposures.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information",

The increased expense in 2020 was  driven  by  additional  liquidity  costs  related  to  COVID-19 market stress in the first half of that year.\n\nOperating expenses decreased by USD 30 million to USD 42 million.\n\n## Non-core and Legacy Portfolio\n\nThe Non-core and Legacy Portfolio result was negative USD 79 million, compared with negative USD 269 million. This result was partly due to valuation gains of USD 58 million on our USD 1.6 billion portfolio of auction rate securities (ARS), compared with valuation  losses  of  USD 9  million  in  2020.  Our  remaining exposures  to  ARS  were  all  rated  investment  grade  as  of 31 December 2021. In addition, 2021 included income of USD 51 million related to a legacy bankruptcy claim, while 2020 included a credit loss expense of USD 42 million on an energy-related exposure.\n\n## Group Services\n\nThe  Group  Services  result  was  negative  USD 165  million, compared  with  negative  USD 450  million.  There  were  lower expenses relating to our legal entity transformation program and decreased  funding  costs  on  deferred  tax  assets.  Also,  2020 included real estate costs of USD 72 million related to early lease terminations  and  associated  provisions,  an  impairment  of internally generated software of USD 67 million, and expenses of USD 54 million related to the modification of certain outstanding deferred compensation awards.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Group performance' section and 'Note 1b Changes in accounting policies, comparability and other adjustments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the modification of deferred compensation awards",

Investors should also carefully review all information set out in the 'Risk factors' section of this report, where we discuss these and other material risks that we consider could have an effect on our ability to execute  our  strategy  and  may  affect  our  business  activities, financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.\n\n- -The  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  its  impact  on  growth, employment, debt dynamics and supply chains, remains an important driver of risk, and we expect this to be the case for at least the near future. The Omicron variant continues to spread,  and  there  is  uncertainty  about  when  restrictions introduced in many countries will be eased.\n- -There continue to be concerns regarding a resurgence in global inflation, and the timing and extent of central bank policy responses  (i.e.,  interest  rate  hikes  and  the  tapering  of quantitative easing) will be an area of focus in the coming months. There are related concerns about increasing energy and other commodity prices in a number of countries, while mounting global supply chain stresses and tight labor markets are creating negative pressure on growth. China is facing several challenges, including a slowing economy following the post-pandemic boom.\n- -We remain watchful of a range of geopolitical developments in Europe and Asia and political changes in a number of countries. Our current focus is on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our current direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is limited, as is our exposure to peripheral European countries. However, market  closures,  the  imposition  of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures. In addition, we have significant country risk exposure to major economies, which could also be affected, including the US, China, Switzerland, Germany, the UK and France.\n- -We are exposed to a number of macroeconomic issues, as well as general market conditions. As noted in 'Market, credit and macroeconomic risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report, these external pressures may have a significant adverse effect on our business activities and related financial results, primarily  through  reduced  margins  and  revenues,  asset impairments and other valuation adjustments. Accordingly, these macroeconomic factors are considered in the development of stress testing scenarios for our ongoing risk management activities.\n\n- -We are exposed to substantial changes in the regulation of our businesses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, as discussed in the 'Regulatory and  legal developments' section of this report and in 'Regulatory and legal risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report.\n- -As a global financial services firm, we are subject to many different  legal,  tax  and  regulatory  regimes  and  extensive regulatory oversight. We are exposed to significant liability risk, and  we  are  subject  to  various  claims,  disputes,  legal proceedings  and  government  investigations,  as  noted  in 'Regulatory and legal risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report. Information about litigation, regulatory and similar matters  we  consider  significant  is  disclosed  in  'Note 18 Provisions  and  contingent  liabilities'  in  the  'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report.\n- -Cyber threats continue to evolve at pace, not least due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and can impact the industry, as well as critical infrastructure which it relies on. More recently, ransomware attacks with a possible widespread impact have increased  significantly.  Additionally,  as  a  result  of  the operational complexity of all our businesses, we are continually exposed to operational resilience scenarios such as process error, failed execution, system failures and fraud.\n- -Conduct risks are inherent in our businesses. Achieving fair outcomes  for  our  clients,  upholding  market  integrity  and cultivating the highest standards of employee conduct are of critical importance to UBS. Management of conduct risks is an integral part of our risk management framework.\n- -Financial  crime  -  including  money  laundering,  terrorist financing, sanctions violations, fraud, bribery and corruption presents significant risk. Heightened regulatory expectations and attention require investment in people and systems, while emerging technologies and changing geopolitical risks further increase the complexity of identifying and preventing financial crime.  Refer  to  'Non-financial  risk'  in  this  section  and 'Strategy, management and operational risks' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information.\n- -Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks are a growing area  of  focus  for  regulators  and  other  stakeholders,  in particular  climate  risks  and  concerns  about  greenwashing, where UBS may be subject to reputational risk if not fully aligned with the stated purpose of the firm. New standards and rules are developing in several jurisdictions with the risk of divergent rules increasing and leading to an increased risk that UBS may not comply with all relevant regulations.

The BoD is supported by its Risk Committee, which monitors and oversees the  Group's  risk  profile  and  the  implementation  of  the  risk framework approved by the BoD, and approves the Group's risk appetite methodology. The Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) helps the BoD meet its duty to safeguard and advance UBS's reputation for responsible and sustainable conduct,  reviewing  stakeholder  concerns  and  expectations pertaining to UBS's societal contribution and corporate culture. The Audit Committee assists the BoD with its oversight duty relating to financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting, and the effectiveness of whistleblowing procedures and the external and internal audit functions.\n\nThe Group Executive Board (the GEB) has overall responsibility for establishing and implementing a risk management and control framework in the Group, managing the risk profile of the Group as a whole.\n\nThe Group  Chief  Executive  Officer has  responsibility  and accountability for the management and performance of the Group, has risk authority over transactions, positions and exposures, and allocates  business  divisions  and  Group  Functions  risk  limits approved by the BoD.\n\nThe business division Presidents and Group function heads are responsible for the operation and management of their business divisions, including controlling the dedicated financial resources and risk appetite of the business division.\n\nThe regional  Presidents are  responsible  for  cross-divisional collaboration in their regions and are mandated to inform the GEB about  any  activities  /  issues  that  may  give  rise  to  actual  or potentially material regulatory or reputational concerns.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer (the Group CRO) is responsible for  developing  the  Group's  risk  management  and  control framework (including risk principles and risk appetite) for credit, market, country, treasury, model and sustainability and climate risks. This includes risk measurement and aggregation, portfolio controls and risk reporting. The Group CRO sets risk limits and approves credit and market risk transactions and exposures. Risk Control is also the central function for model risk management and control for all models used in UBS. A framework of policies and authorities support the risk control process.\n\nThe Group  Chief  Compliance  and  Governance  Officer is responsible for developing the Group's operational risk framework, which sets the general requirements for identification, management,  assessment  and  mitigation  of operational risk, and for ensuring that all non-financial risks are identified, owned and managed according to the operational risk appetite objectives, supported by an effective control framework.\n\nThe Group  Chief  Financial Officer is responsible for transparency in assessing the financial performance of the Group and  the  business  divisions,  and  for  managing  the  Group's financial  accounting,  controlling,  forecasting,  planning  and reporting. Additional responsibilities include managing UBS's tax affairs, as well as treasury and capital management, including funding and liquidity risk and UBS's regulatory capital ratios.\n\nThe Group General Counsel is responsible for managing the Group's legal affairs (including litigation involving UBS), ensuring effective and timely assessment of legal matters impacting the Group or its businesses, and managing and reporting all litigation matters.\n\nThe Head of Human Resources is responsible for independent oversight and challenge of employment-related risks.\n\nGroup  Internal  Audit (GIA)  independently  assesses  the effectiveness of processes to define strategy and risk appetite and overall adherence to the approved strategy. It also assesses the effectiveness  of  governance  processes  and  risk  management, including compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and internal governance documents. The Head GIA reports to the Chairman of the BoD. GIA also has a functional reporting line to the BoD Audit Committee.\n\nSome of these roles and responsibilities are replicated for certain significant legal entities of the Group. The legal entity risk officers are responsible for independent oversight and control of financial  and  non-financial  risks  for  certain  significant  legal entities of the Group as part of the legal entity control framework, which complements the Group's risk management and control framework. \uf070",

This is reviewed and recalibrated annually and presented to the BoD for approval.\n\nOur risk appetite is defined at the aggregate Group level and reflects the types of risk that we are willing to accept or avoid. It is set via complementary qualitative and quantitative risk appetite statements  defined  at  a  firm-wide  level  and  is  embedded throughout our business divisions and legal entities by Group, business division and legal entity policies, limits and authorities. We are subject to consolidated supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and related ordinances, which impose, among other requirements, minimum standards for capital, liquidity, risk concentration and internal organization. Our risk appetite is reviewed and recalibrated annually, with the aim of ensuring that risk-taking at every level of the organization is in line with our strategic priorities, our capital and liquidity plans,  our Pillars, Principles  and  Behaviors , and  minimum regulatory requirements. The 'Risk appetite framework' chart below shows the key elements of the framework, described in detail in this section.\n\nQualitative risk appetite statements aim to ensure we maintain the desired risk culture. Quantitative risk appetite objectives are designed  to  enhance  UBS's  resilience  against  the  effects  of potential severe adverse economic or geopolitical events. These risk appetite objectives cover UBS's minimum capital and leverage ratios, solvency, earnings, liquidity, and funding, and are subject to periodic review, including the yearly business planning process.\n\n## 4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CRRGVKVGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>HTCOGYQTM\n\n4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CRRGVKVGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>HTCOGYQTM\n\n4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CRRGVKVGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>UVCVGOGPVU\n\n## 4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>RTKPEKRNGUglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>IQXGTPCPEGglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>TQNGU glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>TGURQPUKDKNKVKGU\n\n## 4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>QDLGEVKXGUglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>OGCUWTGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>EQPVTQNU\n\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>OCPCIGOGPVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>EQPVTQNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>RTKPEKRNGU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>%QFGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QHglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>%QPFWEVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>'VJKEU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>6QVCNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>4GYCTFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>2TKPEKRNGU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>1TICPK\\CVKQPglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGIWNCVKQPUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=17,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>RQNKEKGU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>)TQWRglyph<c=15,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>YKFGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TKUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CRRGVKVGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QDLGEVKXGU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>1RGTCVKQPCNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TKUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CRRGVKVGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QDLGEVKXGU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>OGCUWTGOGPVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>HTCOGYQTMU\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>#WVJQTKVKGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>NKOKVUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>\n- sglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>4QNGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGURQPUKDKNKVKGU\n\n4KUMglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGRQTVKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>FKUENQUWTGglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPENWFKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPVGTPCNglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGIWNCVQT[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>GZVGTPCNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGRQTVKPI\n\nThese  objectives  are  complemented  by  operational  risk appetite objectives, which are set for each of our non-financial risk  categories,  including  market  conduct,  theft,  fraud,  data confidentiality and technology risks. A standardized financial firmwide operational risk appetite has been established at Group level and is embedded throughout our business divisions. Operational risk events exceeding predetermined risk tolerances, expressed as percentages of UBS's operating income, must be escalated as per the firm-wide escalation framework to the respective business division President or higher, as appropriate.\n\nThe quantitative risk appetite objectives are supported by a comprehensive suite of risk limits set at a portfolio level to monitor specific portfolios and to control potential risk concentrations.\n\nThe status of risk appetite objectives is evaluated each month and reported to the BoD and the GEB. As our risk appetite may change  over  time,  portfolio  limits  and  associated  approval authorities are subject to periodic reviews and changes, particularly in the context of our annual business planning process.\n\nOur risk appetite framework is governed by a single overarching policy and conforms to the Financial Stability Board's Principles for an Effective Risk Appetite Framework.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk principles and risk culture' and 'Quantitative risk appetite objectives' on the following pages for more information",

        "page_content": "## Risk principles and risk culture\n\nMaintaining a strong risk culture is a prerequisite for success in today's highly complex operating environment and a source of sustainable competitive advantage. Placing prudent and disciplined risk-taking at the center of every decision has three principal goals: delivering unrivaled client satisfaction; creating long-term value for stakeholders; and making UBS one of the world's most attractive companies to work for.\n\nOur  risk  appetite  framework  combines  all  the  important elements of our risk culture, expressed in our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors , our risk management and control principles, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our Total Reward Principles. Together, these  aim  to  align  our  decisions  with  the  Group's  strategy, principles and risk appetite. They help create a solid foundation for promoting risk awareness, leading to appropriate risk-taking\n\nand the establishing of robust risk management and control processes. These principles are supported by a range of initiatives covering employees at all levels, for example the UBS House View on Leadership , which is a set of explicit expectations for leaders that  establishes  consistent  leadership  standards  across  UBS. Another example is our Principles of Good Supervision, which establish clear expectations  of  managers  and  employees regarding supervisory responsibilities, specifically: to take responsibility; to know and organize their business; to know their employees and what they do; to create a good risk culture; and to respond to and resolve issues.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the foldout pages of this report for more information about our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors\n- \u203a Refer to the Code of Conduct and Ethics of UBS at ubs.com/code for more information\n\n## Risk management and control principles\n\n| Protection of financial strength   | Protecting UBS's financial strength by controlling our risk exposure and avoiding potential risk  concentrations at individual exposure levels, at specific portfolio levels and at an aggregate firm-wide  level across all risk types              |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Protection of reputation           | Protecting our reputation through a sound risk culture characterized by a holistic and integrated view of  risk, performance and reward, and through full compliance with our standards and principles, particularly  our Code of Conduct and Ethics |\n| Business management accountability | Maintaining management accountability, whereby business management owns all risks assumed  throughout the Group and is responsible for the continuous and active management of all risk exposures  to provide for balanced risk and return           |\n| Independent controls               | Independent control functions that monitor the effectiveness of the businesses' risk management and  oversee risk-taking activities                                                                                                                  |\n| Risk disclosure                    | Disclosure of risks to senior management, the BoD, investors, regulators, credit rating agencies and other  stakeholders with an appropriate level of comprehensiveness and transparency                                                             |\n\nWhistleblowing policies and procedures exist to support an environment where staff are comfortable raising concerns. There are multiple channels via which individuals may, either openly or anonymously, escalate suspected breaches of laws, regulations, rules and other legal requirements, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, policies, or relevant professional standards. Our program is designed to ensure that whistleblowing concerns are investigated and that appropriate and consistent action is taken. We are committed to ensuring appropriate training for and communication  to  staff  and  legal  entity  representatives  are available on an ongoing basis, including with regard to new regulatory requirements.\n\nMandatory training programs cover various compliance and risk-related  topics,  including  operational  risk  and  anti-money laundering. Additional specialized training is provided depending on employees' specific roles and responsibilities, e.g., credit risk and market risk training for those working in trading areas. Failure to complete mandatory training sessions within an appropriate timeframe can lead to consequences, including disciplinary action. Our operational risk and conduct risk frameworks aim to identify and manage financial, regulatory and reputational risks, as well as risks to clients and markets.\n\n## Quantitative risk appetite objectives\n\nOur quantitative risk appetite objectives aim to ensure that our aggregate risk exposure remains within desired risk capacity, based on capital and business plans. The specific definition of risk capacity for each objective is aimed at ensuring we have sufficient capital, earnings, funding and liquidity to protect our businesses and exceed minimum regulatory requirements under a severe stress event. The risk appetite objectives are evaluated during the annual business planning process and approved by the BoD. The comparison  of  risk  exposure  with  risk  capacity  is  a  key consideration  in  decisions  on  potential  adjustments  to  the business strategy and risk profile of UBS and capital returns to shareholders.\n\nThe annual business planning process reviews UBS's business strategy, assesses the risk profile our operations and activities result in, and stress tests that risk profile. We use both scenariobased stress tests and statistical risk measurement techniques to assess effects of severe stress events at a firm-wide level. These complementary frameworks capture exposures to all material risks across our business divisions and Group Functions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our stress testing and statistical stress frameworks",

guidance as per our business plan. When determining our risk capacity in case of a severe stress event, we estimate projected earnings under stress, factoring in lower expected income and also lower expenses. We also consider capital impacts under stress from deferred tax assets, pension plan assets and liabilities, and accruals for capital returns to shareholders.\n\nRisk appetite objectives define the aggregate risk exposure acceptable at the firm-wide level, given our risk capacity. The maximum acceptable risk exposure is supported by a full set of risk limits, triggers and targets, which are cascaded to businesses\n\nand portfolios. These limits, triggers and targets aim to ensure that our total risks remain in line with risk appetite.\n\nRisk  appetite  statements  at  the  business  division  level  are derived from the firm-wide risk appetite. They may also include division-specific strategic goals related to that division's activities and risks. Risk appetite statements are also set for certain legal entities, which must be consistent with the firm-wide risk appetite framework and approved in accordance with Group and legal entity regulations. Differences may exist that reflect the specific nature, size, complexity and regulations applicable to the relevant legal entity.",

The Group Risk Report is distributed internally to the BoD and the GEB, and senior members of Risk Control, GIA, Finance and Legal.

Models may also be used  to  measure  and  monitor  compliance  with  rules  and regulations, for surveillance activities, or to meet financial or regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of adverse consequences (e.g., financial losses or reputational damage) resulting from incorrect models.\n\n## Model governance framework\n\nOur model governance framework establishes requirements for identifying,  measuring,  monitoring,  reporting,  controlling  and mitigating model risks. All the models that we use are subject to governance  and  controls  throughout  their  life  cycles.  This  is designed  to  ensure  that  risks  arising  from  model  use  are identified,  understood,  managed,  monitored,  controlled  and reported  on  both  a  model-specific  and  an  aggregated  level. Before they can be granted approval for use from the model sponsor, all our models are independently validated across four model risk dimensions: (i) model input; (ii) model methodology; (iii) model implementation; and (iv) model use.\n\nOnce validated and approved for use, a model is subject to ongoing  model  performance  monitoring  and  annual  model confirmation, ensuring that the model is only used if it continues to be found fit for purpose. All models are subject to periodic model re-validation, with rigor, depth and frequency determined by the model's materiality and complexity.\n\nOur model risk governance framework follows our overarching risk governance framework, with the three lines of defense (LoD) assigned as follows.\n\n- -First LoD: model sponsors, model owners, model developers, and model users\n- -Second LoD: Chief Model  Risk Officer, Model  Risk Management & Control\n- -Third LoD: Group Internal Audit\n\nAn important difference as compared with how LoD are usually defined in financial and non-financial risk is that some models are owned by traditionally second LoD functions, such as risk control, finance or compliance.\n\n## Model risk appetite framework and statement\n\nThe  model  risk  appetite  framework  sets  out  the  model  risk appetite statement, defines the relevant metrics and lays out how appropriate adherence is assessed.\n\n## Model oversight\n\nModel oversight committees and forums ensure that model risk is overseen  at  different  levels  of  the  organization,  appropriate model risk management and control actions are taken and, where necessary, escalated to the next level.\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee is our most senior oversight and escalation body for all models in scope of our model governance framework. It is co-chaired by the Group CRO and the Group CFO and is responsible for: (i) reviewing and approving changes to the framework; (ii) approving the model risk appetite statement;  (iii) overseeing  adherence  to  the  UBS  model  risk governance framework; and (iv) monitoring model risk at a firmwide level.",

        "page_content": "## Risk measurement\n\nAudited | We apply a variety of methodologies and measurements to  quantify  the  risks  of  our  portfolios  and  potential  risk concentrations. Risks that are not fully reflected within standard measures are subject to additional controls, which may include preapproval of specific transactions and the application of specific restrictions. Models to quantify risk are generally developed by dedicated  units  within  control  functions  and  are  subject  to independent validation. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk,' 'Market risk' and 'Non-financial risk' in this section for more information about model confirmation procedures\n\n## Stress testing\n\nWe perform stress testing to estimate losses that could result from extreme  yet  plausible  macroeconomic  and  geopolitical  stress events to identify, better understand and manage our potential vulnerabilities and risk concentrations. Stress testing has a key role in our limits framework at the firm-wide, business division, legal entity and portfolio levels. Stress test results are regularly reported to  the  BoD  and  the  GEB.  As  described  in  'Risk  appetite framework,' stress testing, along with statistical loss measures, has a central role in our risk appetite and business planning processes.\n\nOur stress testing framework has three pillars: (i) combined stress tests; (ii) an extensive set of portfolio- and risk type-specific stress tests; and (iii) reverse stress testing.\n\nOur combined stress testing (CST) framework is scenario-based and aims to quantify overall firm-wide losses that could result from various potential global systemic events. The framework captures  all  material  risks,  as  covered  in  'Risk  categories.' Scenarios are forward-looking and encompass macroeconomic and geopolitical stress events calibrated to different levels of severity.  We  implement  each  scenario  through  the  expected evolution of market indicators and economic variables under that scenario and then estimate the overall loss and capital implications were  the  scenario  to  occur.  At  least  once  a  year,  the  Risk Committee approves the most relevant scenario, known as the binding scenario, for use as the main scenario for regular CST reporting and for monitoring risk exposure against our minimum capital, earnings and leverage ratio objectives in our risk appetite framework.\n\nWe  provide  detailed  stress  loss  analyses  to  FINMA  and regulators  of  our  legal  entities  in  accordance  with  their requirements.\n\nOur Enterprise-wide Stress Forum (the ESF) aims to ensure the consistency and adequacy of the assumptions and scenarios used for firm-wide stress measures. As part of its responsibilities, the ESF  with  input  from  the  Think  Tank,  a  panel  of  senior representatives  from  the  business  divisions,  Risk  Control  and economic research, seeks to ensure that the set of stress scenarios adequately reflects current and potential developments in the macroeconomic  and  geopolitical  environment,  current  and planned  business  activities, and  actual  or  potential  risk concentrations and vulnerabilities in our portfolios.\n\nEach  scenario  captures  a  wide  range  of  macroeconomic variables, including GDP, equity prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity  prices, property prices and unemployment. We use assumed changes in these macroeconomic and market variables in each scenario to stress the key risk drivers of our portfolios. For example, lower GDP growth and rising interest rates may reduce the income of clients we have lent money to, which changes the credit risk parameters for probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default, and results in higher predicted credit losses within the stress scenario. We also capture the business risk resulting from lower fee, interest and trading income net of lower expenses. These effects are measured for all businesses and material risk types to calculate the aggregate estimated effect of the scenario on profit or loss, other comprehensive income, RWA, LRD and, ultimately, capital and leverage ratios. The assumed changes in macroeconomic variables are updated periodically to account for changes in the current and possible future market environment.\n\nIn 2021, the binding scenario for CST was the internal Global Crisis scenario , which is characterized by a deterioration of global economic conditions leading to sovereign defaults in Europe and a global recession. The scenario was updated over the course of 2021  to  incorporate  current  risks  related  to  COVID-19,  in particular  macroeconomic  assumptions,  such  as  deteriorating GDP and rising unemployment . Continued weakness in economic data  and  tensions  between  European  countries  about  debt mutualization undermines market confidence in the sustainability of peripheral debt, leading to a sharp spike in bond yields. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus receive bailout packages, on the condition of substantial debt restructuring, while Greece leaves the  Eurozone.  In  addition  to  the  effects  of  COVID-19,  the macroeconomic impact is severe, as is the immediate market impact. Weak consumer and business confidence and a fall in global trade as a result of protectionism lead to a global recession. China is hit severely by trade protectionism and a confidence shock, which lead to a hard landing .",

        "page_content": "As part of the CST framework, we routinely monitored three additional stress scenarios throughout 2021:\n\n- -The US Monetary Crisis scenario explores a loss of confidence in the US, which leads to a sell-off of US dollar-denominated assets, sparking an abrupt and substantial depreciation of the US dollar. The US economy is hit hard, financial markets enter a period of high volatility and other industrialized countries replicate  the  cyclical  pattern  of  the  US.  Regional  inflation trends diverge as the US experiences significant inflationary pressures while other developed markets experience deflation.\n- -The Severe Global Interest Rate Steepening scenario explores a sharp and persistent rise in inflation leading to a significant rise in long-term interest rates and a period of market turbulence. Economic activity slows across the globe as both business and household sentiment collapse, while credit conditions deteriorate.  Despite  weakness  in  activity,  inflation  remains stubbornly high, forcing central banks to begin hiking their policy rates and thereby prolonging the weakness in economic activity and asset prices.\n- -The Extreme Coronavirus scenario explores a resurgence of COVID-19 and subsequent containment policies, which lead to a severe global downturn with long-term scarring impacts. The lack of adherence to containment measures leads to rapid resurgences in the number of cases and fatalities, which force countries to enforce increasingly stringent lockdown policies. Vaccines prove to be ineffective in the near term, due to either logistical constraints of vaccine distribution, vaccine hesitancy or virus variants undermining the efficacy of current vaccines.\n\nWe  have  updated  the  binding  stress  scenario  in  our  CST framework for 2022. The updated Global Crisis scenario reflects the  weaker  fiscal  conditions  resulting  from  the  COVID-19 pandemic, which leads to sovereign defaults in several emerging markets. The scenario continues to assume a Eurozone crisis and a hard landing in China.\n\nPortfolio-specific stress tests are measures tailored to the risks of  specific  portfolios.  Our  portfolio  stress  loss  measures  are derived from data on past events, but also include forwardlooking elements  (e.g., we  derive  the  expected  market movements  in  our  liquidity-adjusted  stress  metric  using  a combination of historical market behavior, based on an analysis of  historical  events,  and  forward-looking  analysis,  including consideration of defined scenarios not modeled on any historical events). Results of portfolio-specific stress tests may be subject to limits to explicitly control risk-taking or may be monitored without limits to identify vulnerabilities.\n\nReverse stress testing starts from a defined stress outcome (e.g., a specified loss amount, reputational damage, a liquidity shortfall  or  a  breach  of  regulatory  capital  ratios)  and  works backward to identify economic or financial scenarios that could\n\nresult in such an outcome. As such, reverse stress testing is intended to complement scenario-based stress tests by assuming 'what if' outcomes that could extend beyond the range normally considered,  and  thereby  potentially  challenge  assumptions regarding severity and plausibility.\n\nWe also routinely analyze the effect of increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the structure of yield curves.\n\nWithin  Group  Treasury,  we  also  perform  stress  testing  to determine the optimum asset and liability structure, enabling us to  maintain  an  appropriately  balanced  liquidity  and  funding position  under  various  scenarios.  These  scenarios  differ  from those outlined above, because they focus on specific situations that could generate liquidity and funding stress, as opposed to the scenarios used in the CST framework, which focus on the effect on profit or loss and capital.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' and 'Market risk' in this section for more information about stress loss measures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about stress testing\n\n## Statistical measures\n\nWe  complement  the  scenario-based  CST  measures  with  our statistical stress framework to calculate and aggregate risks using statistical techniques to derive stress events at chosen confidence levels.\n\nThis framework is used to derive a loss distribution, considering effects on both income and expenses, based on the simulation of historically  observed  financial  and  economic  risk  factors  in combination with the firm's actual earnings and relevant risk exposures.  From  that,  we  determine  earnings-at-risk  (EaR), measuring the potential shortfall in earnings (i.e., the deviation from forecast earnings) at a 95% confidence level and evaluated over a one-year horizon. EaR is used for the assessment of the earnings objectives in our risk appetite framework.\n\nWe extend the EaR measure, incorporating the effects of gains and losses recognized through other comprehensive income, to derive  a  distribution  of  potential  effects  of  stress  events  on common equity tier 1 capital. From this distribution, we derive our capital-at-risk (CaR) buffer measure at a 95% confidence level to assess our capital and leverage ratio risk appetite objectives, and derive our CaR solvency measure at a 99.9% confidence level to assess our solvency risk appetite objective.\n\nWe use the CaR solvency measure as a basis for deriving the contributions of the business divisions to risk-based capital (RBC), which is a component of our equity attribution framework. RBC measures the potential capital impairment from an extreme stress event at a 99.9% confidence level.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the equity attribution framework",

        "page_content": "## Portfolio and position limits\n\nUBS maintains a comprehensive set of risk limits across its major risk portfolios. These portfolio limits are set based on our risk appetite and periodically reviewed and adjusted as part of the business planning process.\n\nFirm-wide stress and statistical metrics are complemented by more granular portfolio and position limits, triggers and targets. Combining these measures provides a comprehensive control framework to apply to our business divisions, as well as the significant legal entities, as relevant to the key risks arising from their businesses.\n\nWe apply limits to a variety of exposures at portfolio level, using statistical and stress-based measures, such as value-at-risk, liquidity-adjusted stress, loan underwriting limits, economic value sensitivity and portfolio default simulations for loan books. These are complemented with a set of controls for net interest income sensitivity, mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale portfolios, and the effect of foreign exchange movements on capital and capital ratios.\n\nPortfolio  measures  are  supplemented  with  position-level controls. Risk measures for position controls are based on market risk  sensitivities  and  counterparty-level  credit  risk  exposures. Market risk sensitivities include sensitivities to changes in general market risk factors (e.g., equity indices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates) and sensitivities to issuer-specific factors (e.g., changes in an issuer's credit spread or default risk). We monitor numerous market and treasury risk controls on a daily basis. Counterparty measures capture the current and potential future exposure to an individual counterparty, considering collateral and legally enforceable netting agreements.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' in this section for more information about counterparty limits\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk appetite framework' in this section for more information about the risk appetite framework\n\n## Risk concentrations\n\nAudited  | Risk  concentrations  may  exist  where  one  or  several positions within or across different risk categories could result in significant losses relative to UBS's financial strength. Identifying such risk concentrations and assessing their potential impact is a critical component of our risk management and control process.\n\nFor financial risks, we consider a number of elements, such as shared characteristics of positions, the size of the portfolio and the  sensitivity  of  positions  to  changes  in  the  underlying  risk factors. Also important in our assessment is the liquidity of the markets where the positions are traded, as well as the availability and effectiveness of hedges or other potential risk-mitigating factors. This includes an assessment of the provider of the hedge and market liquidity where the hedge might be traded. Particular attention is given to identification of wrong-way risk and risk on risk. Wrong-way risk is defined as a positive correlation between the size of the exposure and the likelihood of a loss. Risk on risk is when a position and its risk mitigation can be impacted by the same event.\n\nFor non-financial risks, risk concentrations may result from, for example, a single operational risk issue that is large on its own (i.e., has the potential to produce a single high-impact loss or a number of losses that together are high impact) or related risk issues that may link together to create a high impact.\n\nRisk concentrations are subject to increased oversight by Group Risk Control and Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance, and assessed to determine whether they should be reduced or mitigated, depending on the available means to do so. It is possible that material losses could occur on financial or nonfinancial risks, particularly if the correlations that emerge in a stressed environment differ markedly from those envisaged by risk models. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk' and 'Market risk' in this section for more information about the composition of our portfolios\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information",

Nevertheless,  we continue to be exposed to the development of the global economy and the effects of the ongoing and highly uncertain COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe incurred a loss of USD 861 million in the first half of 2021 on the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business. We have conducted a thorough review and put in place appropriate measures to strengthen our relevant client onboarding and risk management and control processes. Across the items identified for remediation and beyond, we have made changes to our organization to drive wider improvements in both first and second lines of defense. Our prime brokerage business remains a strategic element of UBS's offering.\n\n## Credit loss expense / release\n\nTotal net credit loss releases were USD 148 million in 2021, compared with net credit loss expenses of USD 694 million in the prior year, reflecting net releases of USD 123 million related to stage 1 and 2 positions and net releases of USD 25 million related to credit-impaired (stage 3) positions.\n\nStage 1 and 2 net credit loss releases of USD 123 million in 2021 included a partial net release of a post-model adjustment of USD 68  million,  due  to  the  continued  positive  trend  in macroeconomic scenario input data during the year, a USD 45\n\n## Credit loss (expense) / release\n\nmillion net release from a number of model and methodology changes, a residual USD 10 million net release from remeasurements  within  the  loan  book,  and  derecognized transactions, partially offset by expenses from new transactions. Stage 3 net releases of USD 25 million were recognized across a number  of  defaulted  positions,  primarily  corporate  lending positions in Personal & Corporate Banking.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies,' 'Note 9 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement' and 'Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about IFRS 9 and expected credit losses\n\n## Audited | Main sources of credit risk\n\n- -Global Wealth Management predominantly conducts securities-based (Lombard) lending and mortgage lending.\n- -A substantial portion of lending exposure arises from Personal & Corporate Banking, which offers mortgage loans, secured mainly by residential properties and income-producing real estate, as well as corporate loans, and therefore depends on the performance of the Swiss economy.\n- -The  Investment  Bank's  credit  exposure  arises  mainly  from lending, derivatives trading and securities financing. Derivatives  trading  and  securities  financing  are  mainly investment grade. Loan underwriting activity can be lower rated and give rise to temporary concentrated exposure.\n- -Credit risk within Non-core and Legacy Portfolio relates to derivative transactions and securitized positions. \uf070\n\n| USD million                                                                 | Global  Wealth  Management   | Personal &  Corporate  Banking   | Asset Management   | Investment  Bank   | Group  Functions   | Total      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|\n| FFoorr  tthhee  yyeeaarr  eennddeedd  3311..1122..2211                      |                              |                                  |                    |                    |                    |            |\n| Stages 1 and 2                                                              | 2288                         | 6622                             | 00                 | 3344               | 00                 | 112233     |\n| Stage 3                                                                     | 11                           | 2244                             | ((11))             | 00                 | 00                 | 2255       |\n| T Toottaall  ccrreeddiitt  lloossss  ((eexxppeennssee))  //  rreelleeaassee | 2299                         | 8866                             | ((11))             | 3344               | 00                 | 114488     |\n| F Foorr  tthhee  yyeeaarr  eennddeedd  3311..1122..2200                     |                              |                                  |                    |                    |                    |            |\n| Stages 1 and 2                                                              | (48)                         | (129)                            | 0                  | (88)               | 0                  | (266)      |\n| Stage 3                                                                     | (40)                         | (128)                            | (2)                | (217)              | (42)               | (429)      |\n| TToottaall  ccrreeddiitt  lloossss  ((eexxppeennssee))  //  rreelleeaassee  | ((8888))                     | ((225577))                       | ((22))             | ((330055))         | ((4422))           | ((669944)) |\n| F Foorr  tthhee  yyeeaarr  eennddeedd  3311..1122..1199                     |                              |                                  |                    |                    |                    |            |\n| Stages 1 and 2                                                              | 3                            | 23                               | 0                  | (4)                | 0                  | 22         |\n| Stage 3                                                                     | (23)                         | (44)                             | 0                  | (26)               | (7)                | (100)      |\n| T Toottaall  ccrreeddiitt  lloossss  ((eexxppeennssee))  //  rreelleeaassee | ((2200))                     | ((2211))                         | 00                 | ((3300))           | ((77))             | ((7788))   |",

Limits  are established for individual counterparties and groups of related counterparties covering banking and traded products, and for settlement amounts. Risk authorities are approved by the BoD and are delegated to the Group CEO, the Group CRO and divisional CROs, based on risk exposure amounts, internal credit rating and potential for losses.\n- -Limits apply not only to the current outstanding amount but also  to  contingent  commitments  and  the  potential  future exposure of traded products.\n- -The  Investment  Bank  monitoring,  measurement  and  limit framework distinguishes between exposures intended to be held to maturity (take-and-hold exposures) and those intended for distribution or risk transfer (temporary exposures).\n- -We use models to derive portfolio credit risk measures of expected loss, statistical loss and stress loss at Group-wide and business division levels, and to establish portfolio limits.\n- -Credit risk concentrations can arise if clients are engaged in similar activities, located in the same geographical region or have comparable economic characteristics, e.g., if their ability to meet contractual obligations would be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. To avoid credit risk concentrations, we establish limits / operational controls that constrain risk concentrations at portfolio and subportfolio levels for sector exposure, country risk and specific product exposures. \uf070\n\n## Credit risk profile of the Group\n\nThe exposures detailed in this section are based on management's view of credit risk, which differs in certain respects from the expected credit loss (ECL) measurement requirements of IFRS.\n\nInternally,  we  put  credit  risk  exposures  into  two  broad categories:  banking  products  and  traded  products.  Banking products include drawn loans, guarantees and loan commitments,  amounts  due  from  banks,  balances  at  central banks,  and  other  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost.  Traded products include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, exchangetraded derivatives (ETDs) and securities financing transactions (SFTs),  consisting  of  securities  borrowing  and  lending,  and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n## Banking products\n\nBreakdowns of banking products exposures in the 'Banking and traded products exposure in our business divisions and Group Functions' table on the next page reflect the total exposures within  the  scope  of  ECL  requirements  and  are  gross  before allowances and provisions for ECL and credit hedges. Guarantees and loan commitments are shown on a notional basis, without applying credit conversion factors.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our accounting policy for allowances and provisions for ECL\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 9 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement' and 'Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement' in the\n- 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about ECL measurement requirements under IFRS\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 14a Other financial assets measured at amortized cost' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more details",

banking  products  exposure  within  Global  Wealth Management increased to USD 337 billion from USD 300 billion.\n\nOur  Global  Wealth  Management  loan  portfolio  is  mainly secured  by  securities  (Lombard  loans)  and  by  residential  real estate. Most Lombard loans were of high quality, with 93% rated as  investment  grade  based  on  our  internal  ratings,  and  are typically short term in nature, with an average loan-to-value (LTV) of 46%. Moreover, Lombard loans can be canceled immediately if the collateral quality deteriorates and margin calls are not met. In 2021, the Lombard book, including traded products, increased approximately  10%,  while  keeping  a  stable  risk  profile  with regard to collateral concentrations with no material losses. The increase was mainly driven by higher loan volumes in the US that\n\nare collateralized by highly liquid and diversified securities. The share of non-standard Lombard loans, for example with less liquid or concentrated collateral, was stable at approximately 4% of the total Lombard book.\n\nThe mortgage book increased by approximately 8%, driven by higher volumes of mortgage loans in the US residential real estate portfolios (average LTV 51%).\n\nOther financings and non-standard loans represent approximately 3% of the total banking products exposures and are consolidated in a corporate and other portfolio that increased approximately 57% in 2021, mainly driven by private equity subscription facilities in the US, which are mostly investment grade rated.",

UBS applies a risk-based approach that generally prioritizes collateral according to its liquidity profile. In 2021, the collateral allocation was refined to reflect additional cash collateral and custody accounts that are also available as security for certain on-balance sheet lending. This resulted in an increase in loans secured by cash, with an offsetting reduction in loans secured by residential real estate and loans secured by securities.\n\n## Personal & Corporate Banking\n\nGross  banking  products  exposure  (excluding  exposure  reallocated from Group Treasury) within Personal & Corporate Banking was largely unchanged in our reporting currency at USD 186  billion  (CHF 170  billion),  compared  with  USD 187 billion (CHF 165 billion). Net banking products exposure was USD 186  billion  (CHF 169  billion),  compared  with  USD 186 billion  (CHF 165  billion),  of  which  approximately  65%  was classified as investment grade, unchanged from 2020. Around 50% of the exposure is categorized in the lowest LGD bucket, i.e., 0-25%, similar to 2020. Personal & Corporate Banking's gross  loan  portfolio  was  USD 153  billion  (CHF 139  billion) compared with USD 154 billion (CHF 136 billion) in 2020. This portfolio is predominantly denominated in Swiss francs and the increase in Swiss franc terms was more than offset by the effect of the US dollar appreciating. As of 31 December 2021, 93% of this portfolio was secured by collateral, mainly residential and commercial  property.  Of  the  total  unsecured  amount,  83% related to cash flow-based lending to corporate counterparties and 4% related to lending to public authorities. Based on our internal ratings, 50% of the unsecured loan portfolio was rated as investment grade, compared with 45% in 2020.\n\nThe improved macroeconomic environment for most industries along with the supporting measures of the Swiss Government and Cantons, such as COVID-19 loans, short-time work compensation and subsidies, as well as our careful risk management, led to numerous credit loss releases during 2021.\n\nOur Swiss corporate banking products portfolio, which was USD 36 billion (CHF 33 billion) compared with USD 35 billion (CHF 31 billion) in 2020, consists of loans, guarantees and loan commitments to multi-national and domestic counterparties. The small and medium-sized entity (SME) portfolio, in particular, is well diversified across industries. However, such companies are reliant on the domestic economy and the economies to which they export, in particular the EU and the US. In addition, the change in the EUR / CHF exchange rate is an important risk factor for Swiss corporate clients.\n\nOur commodity trade finance portfolio focuses on energy and base-metal trading companies, where the related commodity price risk is hedged to a large extent by the commodity trader. The majority of limits in this business are uncommitted, transactional and short-term in nature. Our portfolio size was USD 8 billion (CHF 7 billion) as of 31 December 2021, compared with USD 6 billion (CHF 5 billion) in 2020, with the increase in exposure mainly driven by the strong appreciation of commodity prices in 2021.\n\nOur exposure to banks consists primarily of contingent claims and was USD 6 billion (CHF 5 billion), unchanged compared with 2020.\n\nThe delinquency ratio was 0.3% for the corporate portfolio, compared with 0.4% at the end of 2020.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk models' in this section for more information about loss given default, rating grades and rating agency mappings\n\n## Swiss mortgage loan portfolio\n\nOur Swiss mortgage loan portfolio secured by residential and commercial real estate in Switzerland continues to be our largest loan portfolio. These mortgage loans, totaling USD 167 billion (CHF 152 billion), mainly originate from Personal & Corporate Banking,  but  also  from  Global  Wealth  Management  Region Switzerland. Of these mortgage loans, USD 152 billion (CHF 138 billion) related to residential properties that the borrower was either  occupying  or  renting  out,  with  full  recourse  to  the borrower. Of this USD 152 billion (CHF 138 billion), USD 110 billion (CHF 100 billion) is related to properties occupied by the borrower, with an average LTV ratio of 52%, compared with 54% as of 31 December 2020. The average LTV for newly originated loans for this portfolio was 64%, compared with 67% in 2020. The  remaining  USD 42  billion  (CHF 38  billion)  of  the  Swiss residential mortgage loan portfolio related to properties rented out by the borrower and the average LTV of that portfolio was 52%, compared with 53% as of 31 December 2020. The average LTV for newly originated Swiss residential mortgage loans for properties rented out by the borrower was 55%, compared with 56% in 2020.\n\nAs illustrated in the 'Swiss mortgages: distribution of net exposure at default (EAD) across exposure segments and loan-tovalue (LTV) buckets' table on the following page, more than 99% of the aggregate amount of Swiss residential mortgage loans would continue to be covered by the real estate collateral even if the value assigned to that collateral were to decrease 20%, and more than 98% would remain covered by the real estate collateral even if the value assigned to that collateral were to decrease 30%. In this table, the amount of each mortgage loan is allocated across the LTV buckets to indicate the portion at risk at the various value levels shown; for example, a loan of 75 with an LTV ratio of 75% (i.e., a collateral value of 100) would result in allocations of 30 in the less-than-30% LTV bucket, 20 in the 31-50% bucket, 10 in the 51-60% bucket, 10 in the 61-70% bucket and 5 in the 7180% bucket.",

2020. The reduction was driven by lower allocated balances at central banks.\n\n## Investment Bank\n\nThe Investment Bank's lending activities are largely associated with corporate and non-bank financial institutions. The business is broadly diversified across industry sectors, but concentrated in North America.",

Gross  banking  products  exposure excluding  balances  at  central  banks  and  Group  Treasury reallocations decreased to USD 35 billion from USD 37 billion, mostly driven by decreases in irrevocable loan commitments. Based on our internal ratings, 53% of this gross banking products exposure was classified as investment grade. The vast majority of the gross banking products exposure had an estimated LGD below 50%.\n\nOur loan underwriting business's overall ability to distribute risk remained sound. Total mandated temporary loan underwriting exposure ended 2021 at USD 6.6 billion, compared with USD 4.9 billion at the end of the prior year. Loan underwriting exposures are classified as held for trading, with fair values reflecting market conditions at the end of 2021.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk models' in this section for more

        "page_content": "## Group Functions\n\nGross banking products exposure within Group Functions, which arises primarily in connection with treasury activities, increased by USD 13 billion to USD 66 billion from balances at central banks. The  cash  inflow  was  generated  mainly  from  lower  funding consumption by the Investment Bank, shifts within the highquality liquid asset (HQLA) portfolio from securities into cash, and net  new  issuances  of  long-term  debt  issued  measured  at amortized cost.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet assets' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Group Functions' section of this report for more information\n\n## Traded products\n\nAudited  | Counterparty  credit  risk  (CCR)  arising  from  traded products, which include OTC derivatives, ETD exposures and SFTs, originating  in  the  Investment  Bank,  Non-core  and  Legacy Portfolio, and Group Treasury, is generally managed on a closeout basis. This takes into account possible effects of market movements on the exposure and any associated collateral over the time it would take to close out our positions. In the Investment Bank, limits are applied to the potential future exposure per counterparty,  with  the  size  of  the  limit  dependent  on  the counterparty's creditworthiness (as determined by Risk Control). Limit frameworks are also used to control overall exposure to specific classes or categories of collateral on a portfolio level. Such portfolio limits are monitored and reported to senior management.\n\nTrading  in  OTC  derivatives  is  conducted  through  central counterparties (CCPs) where practicable. Where CCPs are not used, we have clearly defined policies and processes for trading on a bilateral basis. Trading is typically conducted under bilateral International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) or similar master netting agreements, which generally allow for close-out\n\nand netting of transactions in case of default, subject to applicable law. For most major market participant counterparties, we use two-way collateral agreements under which either party can be required to provide collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities  when  the  exposure  exceeds  specified  levels.  This collateral typically consists of well-rated government debt or other collateral permitted  by  applicable  regulations.  For  certain counterparties, an initial margin is taken to cover some or all of the  calculated  close-out  exposure.  This  is  in  addition  to  the variation  margin  taken  to  settle  changes  in  market  value  of transactions. Regulations on margining uncleared OTC derivatives continue to evolve. These generally expand the scope of bilateral derivatives activity subject to margining. They will also result in greater amounts of initial margin received from, and posted to, certain bilateral trading counterparties than had been required in the past. These changes should result in lower close-out risk over time. \uf070\n\nIn the tables on the following page, OTC derivatives exposures are generally presented as net positive replacement values after the application of legally enforceable netting agreements and the deduction of cash and marketable securities held as collateral. SFT exposures are reported taking into account collateral received, and ETD exposures take into account collateral margin calls.\n\nThe 'Banking and traded products exposure in our business divisions and Group Functions' table in this section provides information on the split by divisions and products, and the tables on the next page provide information about the OTC derivatives, SFT and ETD exposures of the Investment Bank, Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, and Group Treasury.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about OTC derivatives settled through central counterparties\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 22 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the effect of netting and collateral arrangements on derivative exposures",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk mitigation\n\nAudited | We actively manage credit risk in our portfolios by taking collateral against exposures and by utilizing credit hedging. \uf070\n\n## Lending secured by real estate\n\nAudited | We use a scoring model as part of a standardized frontto-back process for credit decisions on originating or modifying Swiss mortgage loans. The model's two key factors are the LTV ratio and an affordability calculation relative to gross income. \uf070\n\nThe  calculation  of  affordability  takes  into  account  interest payments, minimum  amortization requirements, potential property maintenance costs and, for rental properties, the level of rental income. Interest payments are estimated using a predefined framework, which considers the potential for significant interest rates increases over the lifetime of the loan. The interest rate is set at 5% per annum in the context of the current environment.\n\nFor  residential  properties  occupied  by  the  borrower,  the maximum LTV for the standard approval process is 80% and 60% for holiday homes and luxury real estate. For other properties, the maximum  LTV  allowed  within  the  standard  approval  process ranges from 30% to 80%, depending on the type and age of the property, and the amount of renovation work needed.\n\nAudited | The value we assign to each property is based on the lowest  value  determined  from  model-derived  valuations,  the purchase price, an asset value for income-producing real estate (IPRE), and, in some cases, an additional external valuation for owner-occupied residential properties (ORPs). \uf070\n\nTwo separate models provided by a market-leading external vendor are used to derive property valuations for ORPs and IPRE. We estimate the current value of an ORP using a regression model (a hedonic model) based on statistical comparison against current transaction data. We derive the value of a property from the characteristics of the real estate itself, as well as those of its location. In addition to the initial valuation, values for ORPs are updated quarterly over the lifetime of the loan using regionspecific real estate price indices. The price indices are sourced from an external vendor and subject to internal validation and benchmarking. We use these valuations quarterly to compute indexed LTV for all ORPs. A portfolio-specific monitoring system considers these along with other risk measures (e.g., rating and behavioral information) to identify higher-risk loans and triggers an assessment and reappraisal by client advisors and credit officers as needed.\n\nFor IPRE, the capitalization rate model is used to determine the property valuation by discounting estimated sustainable future income using a capitalization rate based on various attributes. These attributes consider regional and  specific property characteristics, such as market and location data (e.g., vacancy rates), benchmarks (e.g., for running costs) and certain other standardized input parameters (e.g., property condition). Updated information regarding rental income from IPRE is requested from the client at least once every three years. Our portfolio-specific monitoring system alerts us to changes in rental income and other risk  measures  (e.g.,  LTV,  rating,  behavioral  information),  and triggers an assessment and reappraisal by client advisors and credit officers as needed.\n\nTo take market developments into account for these models, the external vendor regularly updates the parameters and / or refines the architecture for each model. Model changes and parameter updates are subject to the same validation procedures as our internally developed models.\n\nAudited  | We similarly apply underwriting guidelines for our Global Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan portfolio, taking into account loan affordability and collateral sufficiency. LTV standards are defined for the various mortgage types, such as residential mortgages or investment properties, based on associated risk factors, such as property type, loan size, and purpose. The maximum LTV allowed within the standard approval process ranges from 45% to 80%. In addition to LTV, other credit risk metrics, such as debt-to-income ratios, credit scores  and  required  client  reserves,  are  also  part  of  our underwriting guidelines.\n\nA  risk  limit  framework  is  applied  to  the  Global  Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan portfolio. Limits are set to govern exposures within LTV categories, geographic concentrations, portfolio growth  and  high-risk mortgage segments, such as interest-only loans. These limits are monitored by a specialized credit risk monitoring team and reported to senior management. Supplementing this limit framework is a real estate lending policy and procedures framework, set up to govern real estate lending activities. Quality assurance and quality control programs monitor compliance with mortgage underwriting and documentation requirements.\n\nFor  our  mortgage  loan  portfolio  in  the  Global  Wealth Management regions of EMEA and Asia Pacific, we apply global underwriting  guidelines  with  regional  variations  to  allow  for regulatory  and  market  differentials.  As  in  other  regions,  the underwriting  guidelines  take  into  account  affordability  and collateral sufficiency. Affordability is assessed at a stressed interest rate using, for residential real estate, the borrowers' sustainable income and declared liabilities, and for commercial real estate the quality and sustainability of rental income. For interest-only loans, a declared and evidenced repayment strategy must be in place. The applicable LTV for each mortgage is based on the quality and liquidity of the property and assessed against valuations from bank-appointed third-party valuers. Maximum LTV varies from 30%  to  70%,  depending  on  the  type  and  location  of  the property, as well as other factors. Collateral sufficiency is often further supported by personal guarantees from the borrower. The overall portfolio is centrally assessed against a number of stress scenarios  to  ensure  that  exposures  remain  within  predefined stress limits. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Swiss mortgage loan portfolio' in this section for more information about LTV in our Swiss mortgage portfolio",

        "page_content": "## Lombard lending\n\nAudited  | Lombard loans are secured by pledges of marketable securities,  guarantees  and  other  forms  of  collateral.  Eligible financial  securities  are  primarily  liquid  and  actively  traded transferable securities (such as bonds and equities), and other transferable securities, such as approved structured products for which regular prices are available and the issuer of the security provides a market. To a lesser degree, less liquid collateral is also used.\n\nWe derive lending values by applying discounts (haircuts) to the pledged collateral's market value. Haircuts for marketable securities are calculated to cover possible change in value over a given close-out period and confidence level. Less liquid or more volatile collateral will typically have larger haircuts.\n\nWe assess concentration and correlation risks across collateral posted at a counterparty level, and at a divisional level across counterparties. We also perform targeted Group-wide reviews of concentration. Concentration of collateral in single securities, issuers or issuer groups, industry sectors, countries, regions or currencies may result in higher risk and reduced liquidity. In such cases, the lending value of the collateral, margin call and closeout levels are adjusted accordingly. \uf070\n\nExposures and collateral values are monitored daily, with the aim of ensuring that the credit exposure is always within the established risk tolerance. A shortfall occurs when the lending value drops below the exposure; if it exceeds a defined trigger level, a margin call is initiated, requiring the client to provide additional collateral, reduce the exposure or take other action to bring exposure in line with the agreed lending value of the collateral. If a shortfall increases and exceeds a further trigger level, or the shortfall is not corrected within the required period, a close-out is initiated, through which collateral is liquidated, open derivative positions are closed and guarantees are called.\n\nWe  conduct  stress  testing  of  collateralized  exposures  to simulate  market  events  that  reduce  collateral  value,  increase exposure of traded products, or do both. For certain classes of counterparties, limits on such calculated stress exposures are applied and controlled at a counterparty level. Also, portfolio limits are applied across certain businesses or collateral types.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Stress loss' in this section for more information about our stress testing\n\n## Credit hedging\n\nAudited | We use single-name credit default swaps (CDSs), creditindex CDSs, bespoke protection and other instruments to actively manage credit risk in the Investment Bank and Non-core and Legacy Portfolio. The aim is to reduce concentrations of risk from specific counterparties, sectors or portfolios and, for CCR, the profit  or  loss  effect  arising  from  changes  in  credit  valuation adjustments (CVAs).\n\nWe have strict guidelines with regard to taking credit hedges into account for credit risk mitigation purposes. For example, when monitoring exposures against counterparty limits, we do not usually apply certain credit risk mitigants, such as proxy hedges (credit protection on a correlated but different name) or\n\ncredit-index  CDSs,  to  reduce  counterparty  exposures.  Buying credit protection also creates credit exposure with regard to the protection provider. We monitor and limit exposures to credit protection providers, and also monitor the effectiveness of credit hedges as part of our overall credit exposures to the relevant counterparties.  Trading  with  such  counterparties  is  typically collateralized.  For  credit  protection  purchased  to  hedge  the lending portfolio, this includes monitoring mismatches between the maturity of credit protection purchased and the maturity of the associated loan. Such mismatches result in basis risk and may reduce the effectiveness of the credit protection. Mismatches are routinely reported to credit officers and mitigating actions are taken when necessary. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Mitigation of settlement risk\n\nTo mitigate settlement risk, we reduce actual settlement volumes by using multi-lateral and bilateral agreements with counterparties, including payment netting.\n\nForeign exchange transactions are our most significant source of  settlement  risk.  We  are  a  member  of  Continuous  Linked Settlement (CLS), an industry utility that provides a multi-lateral framework to settle transactions on a delivery-versus-payment basis,  thus  reducing  foreign  exchange-related  settlement  risk relative  to  the  volume  of  business.  However,  mitigation  of settlement risk through CLS and other means does not fully eliminate credit risk in foreign exchange transactions resulting from changes in exchange rates prior to settlement, which is managed as part of our overall credit risk management of OTC derivatives.\n\n## Credit risk models\n\n## Basel III - A-IRB credit risk models\n\nAudited | We have developed tools and models to estimate future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio.\n\nExposures  to  individual  counterparties  are  measured  using three generally accepted parameters: PD, EAD and LGD. For a given credit facility, the product of these three parameters results in the expected loss. These parameters are the basis for the majority of our internal measures of credit risk, and key inputs for regulatory capital calculation under the advanced internal ratingsbased (A-IRB) approach of the Basel III framework. We also use models to derive the portfolio credit risk measures of expected loss, statistical loss and stress loss. \uf070\n\nThe 'Key features of our main credit risk models' table on the next page shows the number and key features of the models we use to derive PD, LGD and EAD for our main portfolios and asset classes, and is followed by more detailed explanations of these models and parameters.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about the regulatory capital calculation under the advanced internal ratings-based approach",

PD ratings are used for credit risk measurement and are an important input for determining credit risk approval authorities. For calculating RWA, a three-basis-point PD floor is applied to banks, corporates and retail exposures, as required under the Basel III framework. We apply an eight-basis-point PD floor for Swiss owner-occupied mortgages and a four-basis-point PD floor for Lombard loans.\n\nPD  is  assessed  using  rating  tools  tailored  to  the  various categories of counterparties. Statistically developed scorecards, based on key attributes of the obligor, are used to determine PD for many corporate clients and loans secured by real estate. Where available, market data may also be used to derive the PD for large corporate counterparties. For low-default portfolios, we take into account available relevant external default data when developing rating tools. For Lombard loans, our rating approach uses  Merton-type  historical  return-based  model  simulations taking into account potential changes in securities collateral value. These categories are also calibrated to our internal credit rating scale (masterscale), designed to ensure a consistent assessment of default  probabilities  across  counterparties.  Our  masterscale expresses one-year default probabilities determined using our various rating tools by means of distinct classes, with each class incorporating  a  range  of  default  probabilities.  Counterparties move  between  rating  classes  as  our  assessment  of  their  PD changes.\n\nThe ratings of major credit rating agencies, and their mapping to our masterscale and internal PD bands, are shown in the 'Internal UBS rating scale and mapping of external ratings' table above. For Moody's and S&P, the mapping is based on the longterm average of one-year default rates available from these rating agencies, with Fitch ratings being mapped to the equivalent S&P ratings. For each external rating category, the average default rate is compared with our internal PD bands to derive a mapping to\n\nour internal rating scale. Our internal rating of a counterparty may thus diverge from one or more of the correlated external ratings shown in the table. Observed defaults by rating agencies may vary through economic cycles, and we do not necessarily expect the actual number of defaults in our equivalent rating band to equal the rating agencies' average in any given period. We periodically assess  the  long-term  average  default  rates  of  credit  rating agencies' ratings and adjust their mapping to our masterscale as needed to reflect any material changes.\n\n## Exposure at default\n\nEAD is the amount we expect to be owed by a counterparty at the time of possible default. We derive EAD from current exposure to the counterparty and possible future exposure development.\n\nThe EAD of an on-balance sheet loan is its notional amount. For off-balance  sheet  commitments  that  are  not  drawn,  credit conversion factors (CCFs) are used in order to obtain an expected on-balance  sheet  amount.  Such  CCFs  are  based  on  historical observations.  To  comply  with  regulatory  guidance,  we  floor individual observed CCF values at zero in the CCF model; i.e., we assume that the drawn EAD will be no less than the drawn amount one year prior to default.\n\nFor traded products, we derive EAD by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques. We assess the net amount that may be owed to us or that we may owe to others, taking into account the effect of market movements over the potential time it would take to close out positions. For ETDs, calculation of EAD takes into account  collateral  margin  calls.  When  measuring  individual counterparty  exposure  against  credit  limits,  we  consider  the maximum likely exposure measured to a high level of confidence. However, when aggregating exposures to different counterparties for portfolio risk measurement purposes, we use the expected exposure to each counterparty at a given time period (usually one year) generated by the same model.",

        "page_content": "We assess exposures where there is a material correlation between the factors driving the credit quality of the counterparty and  those  driving  the  potential  future  value  of  our  traded products exposure (wrong-way risk), and we have established specific controls to mitigate such risks.\n\n## Loss given default\n\nLGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. Our LGD estimates, which consider downturn conditions, include loss of principal, interest and other amounts (such as workout costs, including the cost of carrying an impaired position during the workout process) less recovered amounts. We determine LGD based on the likely recovery rate of claims against defaulted counterparties, which depends on the type of counterparty and any  credit  mitigation  due  to  collateral  or  guarantees.  Our estimates  are  supported  by  internal  loss  data  and  external information,  where  available.  If  we  hold  collateral,  such  as marketable securities or a mortgage on a property, LTV ratios are typically a key parameter in determining LGD. For low-default portfolios, where available, we take into account relevant external default data in the rating tool development. In RWA calculation, a regulatory LGD floor of 10% is applied for exposures secured by residential properties. Additionally, we apply a 25% LGD floor for Lombard loans in Global Wealth Management outside Region Americas and a 20% LGD floor for Lombard loans in Global Wealth Management Region Americas. All other LGDs are subject to a 5% floor.\n\n## Expected loss\n\nCredit losses are an inherent cost of doing business and the occurrence and amount of credit losses can be erratic. We use the concept of expected loss to quantify future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio. The expected loss for a given credit facility is a product of the three components described above, i.e., PD, EAD and LGD. We aggregate the expected loss for individual counterparties to derive expected portfolio credit losses.\n\nExpected  loss  (EL)  for  regulatory  and  internal  risk  control purposes is a statistical measure used to estimate the average annual costs we expect to experience from positions that become impaired. EL is the basis for quantifying credit risk in all our portfolios. We use a statistical modeling approach to estimate the loss profile of each of our credit portfolios over a one-year period to a specified level of confidence. The mean value of this loss distribution is the expected loss. EL provides an indication of the level of risk in our portfolio and it may change over time. Some parameters have to be estimated on a conservative basis in order to  meet  the  regulatory  requirements  for  banks  applying  the internal ratings-based approach to determine RWA.\n\n## IFRS 9 - ECL credit risk models\n\n## Comparison of Basel III EL and IFRS 9 ECL credit risk models\n\nThe IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) concept has a number of key differences from our standard credit risk models, both in the loss estimation  process  and  the  result  thereof.  Most  notably, regulatory  Basel III EL parameters  are  through-the-cycle  / downturn  estimates,  which  might  include  a  margin  of conservatism, while IFRS 9 ECL parameters are typically point-intime, reflecting current economic conditions and future outlook. The table on the next page summarizes the main differences. Stage 1 and 2 ECL releases in 2021 were USD 123 million and respective allowances and provisions as of 31 December 2021 were  USD 503  million.  This  includes  ECL  allowances  and provisions  of  USD 436  million  related  to  positions  under  the Basel III advanced internal ratings-based approach. Basel III EL for non-defaulted positions increased by USD 34 million to USD 919 million.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our accounting policy for allowances and provisions for ECL including key definitions relevant for the ECL calculation under IFRS 9\n\n## Expected credit loss\n\nECL are defined as the difference between contractual cash flows and those UBS expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate (EIR). For loan commitments and other credit facilities in  scope  of  ECL  requirements,  expected  cash  shortfalls  are determined by considering expected future drawdowns. Rather than focusing on an average through-the-cycle expected annual loss, the purpose of ECL is to estimate the amount of losses inherent in a portfolio based on current conditions and future outlook (a point-in-time measure), whereby such a forecast has to include all information available without undue cost and effort, and address multiple scenarios where there is perceived nonlinearity between changes in economic conditions and their effect on credit losses. From a credit risk modeling perspective, ECL parameters are generally derivations of the factors assessed for regulatory Basel III EL.",

Stress  tests  are  run  regularly  to monitor potential effects of extreme, but nevertheless plausible, events on our portfolios, under which key credit risk parameters are assumed to deteriorate substantially. Where we consider it appropriate, we apply limits on this basis.\n\nStress scenarios and methodologies are tailored to portfolios' natures,  ranging  from  regionally  focused  to  global  systemic events, and varying in time horizon. For example, for our loan underwriting portfolio, we apply a global market event under which, simultaneously, the market for loan syndication freezes,\n\nmarket  conditions  significantly  worsen,  and  credit  quality deteriorates. Similarly, for Lombard lending we use a range of scenarios  representing  instantaneous  market  shocks  to  all collateral  and  exposure  positions,  taking  into  consideration liquidity and potential concentration. The portfolio-specific stress test for our mortgage lending business in Switzerland reflects a multi-year  event,  and  the  overarching  stress  test  for  global wholesale and CCR exposure to corporations uses a one-year global stress event and takes into account exposure concentration to single counterparties.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Stress testing' in this section for more information about our stress testing framework",

We therefore perform regular analyses of the evolution of portfolios to identify such changes in the structure and credit quality of portfolios. This includes analyses of changes in key attributes, changes in portfolio concentration measures and changes in RWA.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n\n## Main credit risk models backtesting by regulatory asset class\n\n|                                                         | Length of time series               | Actual rates in %         | Actual rates in %      | Actual rates in %      | Estimated average rates   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                         | used for the calibration (in years) | Average of last 5 years 1 | Min. of last 5 years 2 | Max. of last 5 years 2 | at the start of 2021 in % |\n| P Prroobbaabbiilliittyy  ooff  ddeeffaauulltt 3 3       |                                     |                           |                        |                        |                           |\n| Central governments and central banks                   | >10 4                               | 0.00                      | 0.00                   | 0.00                   | 0.22                      |\n| Banks and securities dealers                            | >10                                 | 0.13                      | 0.00                   | 0.53                   | 0.69                      |\n| Public-sector entities, multi-lateral development banks | >10                                 | 0.04                      | 0.00                   | 0.21                   | 0.21                      |\n| Corporates: specialized lending                         | >10                                 | 0.36                      | 0.14                   | 0.60                   | 1.24                      |\n| Corporates: other lending                               | >10                                 | 0.27                      | 0.20                   | 0.33                   | 0.46                      |\n| Retail: residential mortgages                           | >20                                 | 0.22                      | 0.16                   | 0.28                   | 0.54                      |\n| Retail: other                                           | >10                                 | 0.02                      | 0.00                   | 0.10                   | 0.25                      |\n| LLoossss  ggiivveenn  ddeeffaauulltt                    |                                     |                           |                        |                        |                           |\n| Central governments and central banks                   | >10                                 |                           |                        |                        | 42.49                     |\n| Banks and securities dealers                            | >10                                 |                           |                        |                        | 48.69                     |\n| Public-sector entities, multi-lateral development banks | >10                                 |                           |                        |                        | 24.55                     |\n| Corporates: specialized lending                         | >10                                 | 0.19                      | 0.00                   | 0.92                   | 22.77                     |\n| Corporates: other lending                               | >10                                 | 18.12                     | 0.46                   | 27.00                  | 38.28                     |\n| Retail: residential mortgages                           | >20                                 | 0.58                      | 0.00                   | 0.92                   | 21.34                     |\n| Retail: other                                           | >10                                 | 1.77                      | 0.00                   | 17.90                  | 26.64                     |\n| CCrreeddiitt  ccoonnvveerrssiioonn  ffaaccttoorrss      |                                     |                           |                        |                        |                           |\n| Corporates                                              | >10                                 | 21.06                     | 6.93                   | 37.91                  | 38.72                     |\n\n- 1 1 Average of all observations over the last five years. 2 2 Minimum / maximum annual average of observations in any single year from the last five years. Yearly averages are only calculated where five or more observations occurred during that year. 3 3 Average PD estimation is based on all rated clients in the portfolio. 4 4 Sovereign PD model is calibrated to UBS masterscale, length of time series shows span of internal history for this portfolio.\n\n## Backtesting\n\nWe  monitor  the  performance  of  models  by  backtesting  and benchmarking them, with model outcomes compared with actual results, based on our internal experience and externally observed results. To assess the predictive power of credit exposure models for traded products, such as OTC derivatives and ETD products, we statistically compare predicted future exposure distributions at different forecast horizons with realized values.\n\nFor  PD,  we  use  statistical  modeling  to  derive  a  predicted distribution of the number of defaults. The observed number of defaults is compared with this distribution, letting us derive a statistical level of confidence in the model conservatism. We also derive a lower and upper limit for the average default rate. If the portfolio average PD lies outside the derived interval, the rating tool is, as a general rule, recalibrated.\n\nFor  LGD,  backtesting  statistically  tests  whether  the  mean difference between the observed and predicted LGD is zero. If the test fails, there is evidence that our predicted LGD is too low. In such cases, and where these differences are outside expectations, models are recalibrated.",

Additionally, further exposures in GLR (e.g., covered bonds) have been moved to the standardized approach.\n\nFor CCR models, we recalibrated the market parameters in the SFT model. The transition from LIBOR required a number of model changes for CCR models, for traded products to be able to consume the new alternative reference rate curves.\n\nWhere required, changes to models and model parameters were approved by FINMA before being made.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk-weighted assets' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the effect of the changes to models and model parameters on credit risk RWA\n\n## Future credit risk-related regulatory capital developments\n\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) announced the finalization of the Basel III framework, with an implementation date of 1 January 2023. We expect the Swiss  regulations  to  come  into  force  in  2024.  The  updated framework makes a number of revisions to the internal ratingsbased (IRB) approaches, namely: (i) removing the option of using the A-IRB approach for certain asset classes (including large and medium-sized corporate clients, and banks and other financial institutions); (ii) placing floors on certain model inputs under the IRB approach, e.g., PD and LGD; and (iii) introducing various requirements to reduce RWA variability (e.g., for LGD).\n\nThe published framework has a number of requirements that are subject to national discretion. Also, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) framework were published, including the removal of the advanced CVA approach. UBS has a close dialogue with FINMA to discuss in detail the implementation objectives and prepare for a smooth transition of the capital regime for credit risk.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital management objectives, planning and activities' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the development of RWA\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and 'Risk factors' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Credit policies for distressed assets\n\nThe 'Exposure categorization' chart on the next page shows how we  categorize  banking  products  and  securities  financing transactions as non-performing, defaulted / credit-impaired and purchased or originated credit-impaired.\n\n## Non-performing\n\nAudited | In line with the regulatory definition, we report a claim as non-performing when: (i) it is more than 90 days past due; (ii) it is subject to restructuring proceedings, where preferential conditions concerning interest rates, subordination, tenor, etc. have been granted in order to avoid default of the counterparty (forbearance); (iii) the counterparty is subject to bankruptcy / enforced liquidation proceedings in any form, even if there is sufficient collateral to cover the due payment; or (iv) there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse to collateral.",

        "page_content": "## Default and credit-impaired\n\nUBS uses a single definition of default for classifying assets and determining the PD of its obligors for risk modeling purposes. The definition  of  default  is  based  on  quantitative  and  qualitative criteria. A counterparty is classified as defaulted when material payments of interest, principal or fees are overdue for more than 90 days, or more than 180 days for certain exposures in relation to loans to private and commercial clients in Personal & Corporate Banking and to private clients of Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland. UBS does not consider the general 90-day presumption  for  default  recognition  appropriate  for  those portfolios, given the cure rates, which show that strict application of the 90-day criterion would not accurately reflect the inherent credit risk. Counterparties are also classified as defaulted when: bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or enforced liquidation have commenced; obligations have been restructured on preferential terms (forbearance); or there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse to collateral. The latter may be the case even if, to date, all contractual payments\n\nhave been made when due. If one claim against a counterparty is defaulted on, generally all claims against the counterparty are treated as defaulted.\n\nAn  instrument is classified as credit-impaired if the counterparty is classified as defaulted and / or the instrument is identified as purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI). An instrument is POCI if it has been purchased at a deep discount to its  carrying  amount  following  a  risk  event  of  the  issuer  or originated with a defaulted counterparty. Once a financial asset is classified  as  defaulted  /  credit-impaired  (except  POCI),  it  is reported as a stage 3 instrument and remains as such unless all past due amounts have been rectified, additional payments have been  made  on  time,  the  position  is  not  classified  as  creditrestructured, and there is general evidence of credit recovery. A three-month probation period is applied before a transfer back to stages 1 or 2 can be triggered. However, most instruments remain in stage 3 for a longer period. As of 31 December 2021, we had no instruments classified as POCI on our books. \uf070\n\n## 'ZRQUWTGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>ECVGIQTK\\CVKQP\n\nglyph<c=19,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold> glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>'ZENWFKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>RWTEJCUGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QTglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QTKIKPCVGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>ETGFKVglyph<c=15,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KORCKTGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPUVTWOGPVUglyph<c=16,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light> glyph<c=20,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold> glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>/C[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPENWFGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>RWTEJCUGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QTglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QTKIKPCVGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>ETGFKVglyph<c=15,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KORCKTGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPUVTWOGPVUglyph<c=16,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>\n\n<!-- image -->",

Average management value-at-risk (VaR) (1-day, 95% confidence level) decreased to USD 11 million from USD 13 million in 2020, mainly as a result of the Investment Bank's  equities  trading  business.  The  number  of  negative backtesting  exceptions  within  a  250-business-day  window increased to 4 from 3 by the end of 2021. As these backtesting exceptions  remained  below  5,  the  FINMA  VaR  multiplier  for market risk RWA remained unchanged at 3.0 as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Audited | Main sources of market risk\n\nMarket risks arise from both trading and non-trading business activities.\n\n- -Trading market risks are mainly connected with primary debt and equity underwriting and securities and derivatives trading for market-making and client facilitation in our Investment Bank, as well as the remaining positions in Non-core and Legacy Portfolio in Group Functions and our municipal securities trading business in Global Wealth Management.\n- -Non-trading market risks arise predominantly in the form of interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  risks  connected  with personal banking and lending in our wealth management business, our Swiss personal and corporate banking business, the Investment Bank's lending business, and treasury activities.\n- -Group  Treasury  assumes  market  risks  in  the  process  of managing interest rate risk, structural foreign exchange risk and the Group's liquidity and funding profile, including HQLA.\n- -Equity and debt investments can also give rise to market risks, as can some aspects of employee benefits, such as defined benefit pension schemes. \uf070\n\n## Audited | Overview of measurement, monitoring and management techniques\n\n- -Market risk limits are set for the Group, the business divisions, Group Treasury and Non-core and Legacy Portfolio at granular levels in the various business lines, reflecting the nature and magnitude of the market risks.\n- -Management VaR measures exposures under the market risk framework, including trading market risks and some nontrading market risks. Non-trading market risks not included in VaR are also covered in the risks controlled by Market & Treasury Risk Control, as set out below.\n- -Our primary portfolio measures of market risk are liquidityadjusted stress (LAS) loss and VaR. Both are common to all business divisions and subject to limits that are approved by the Board of Directors (the BoD).\n- -These  measures  are  complemented  by  concentration  and granular limits for general and specific market risk factors. Our trading businesses are subject to multiple market risk limits, which take into account the extent of market liquidity and volatility, available operational capacity, valuation uncertainty and, for our single-name exposures, issuer credit quality.\n- -Trading market risks are managed on an integrated basis at portfolio level. As risk factor sensitivities change due to new transactions, transaction expiries or changes in market levels, risk factors are dynamically rehedged to remain within limits. Thus we do not generally seek to distinguish in the trading portfolio between specific positions and associated hedges.\n- -Issuer risk is controlled by limits applied at business division level based  on  jump-to-zero  measures,  which  estimate maximum default exposure (the default event loss assuming zero recovery).\n- -Non-trading foreign exchange risks are managed under market risk limits, with the exception of Group Treasury management of consolidated capital activity.\n\nOur Market & Treasury Risk Control function applies a holistic risk framework, setting the appetite for treasury-related risktaking  activities  across  the  Group.  A  key  element  of  the framework is an overarching economic value sensitivity limit, set by the BoD. This limit is linked to the level of Basel III common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital, and takes into account risks arising from interest rates, foreign exchange and credit spreads. Also, the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is monitored against targets set by the Group CEO, so as to analyze the outlook and volatility of net interest income based on marketexpected interest rates. Limits are also set by the BoD to balance the effect of foreign exchange movements on our CET1 capital and CET1 capital ratio. Non-trading interest rate and foreign exchange risks are included in Group-wide statistical and stress testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite framework.\n\nEquity and debt investments are subject to a range of risk controls, including preapproval of new investments by business management  and  Risk  Control  and  regular  monitoring  and reporting. They are also included in Group-wide statistical and stress testing metrics. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Currency management' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about Group Treasury's management of foreign exchange risks\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the sensitivity of our CET1 capital and CET1 capital ratio to currency movements",

        "page_content": "## Market risk stress loss\n\nWe measure and manage market risks through a comprehensive framework of non-statistical measures and related limits, as well as VaR. This includes an extensive set of stress tests and scenario analyses, continuously evaluated to ensure that losses resulting from an extreme yet plausible event do not exceed our risk appetite.\n\n## Liquidity-adjusted stress\n\nLAS is our primary stress loss measure for Group-wide market risk. The LAS framework captures the economic losses that could arise under specified stress scenarios. This is partially done by replacing the standard 1-day and 10-day holding period assumptions used for  management  and  regulatory  VaR  with  liquidity-adjusted holding  periods,  as  explained  below.  Shocks  are  applied  to positions based on expected market movements in the liquidityadjusted holding periods resulting from the specified scenario.\n\nThe holding periods used for LAS are calibrated to reflect the time needed to reduce or hedge the risk of positions in each major risk  factor  in  a  stressed  environment,  assuming  maximum utilization of the relevant position limits. We apply minimum holding  periods,  regardless  of  observed  liquidity  levels,  as identification  of  and  reaction  to  a  crisis  may  not  always  be immediate.\n\nThe expected market movements are derived using historical market  behavior  (based  on  analysis  of  historical  events)  and forward-looking  analysis  including  consideration  of  defined scenarios that have not occurred in the past.\n\nLAS-based  limits  apply  at  several  levels:  Group,  business division,  Group  Treasury  and  Non-core  and  Legacy  Portfolio; business area; and sub-portfolio. LAS is also the core market risk component of our combined stress test framework and therefore integral to our overall risk appetite framework.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk appetite framework' in this section for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Stress testing' in this section for more information about our stress testing framework\n\n## Value-at-risk\n\n## VaR definition\n\nAudited | VaR is a statistical measure of market risk, representing the potential market risk losses over a set time horizon (holding period) at an established level of confidence. VaR assumes no change in the Group's trading positions over the set time horizon.\n\nWe calculate VaR daily. The profit or loss distribution VaR is derived from our internally developed VaR model, which simulates returns over the holding period for those risk factors our trading positions are sensitive to, and subsequently quantifies the profit / loss effect of these risk factor returns on trading positions. Risk factor  returns  associated  with  general  interest  rate,  foreign exchange and commodities risk factor classes are based on a pure historical  simulation  approach,  using  a  five-year  look-back window. Risk factor returns for selected issuer-based risk factors, e.g., equity price and credit spreads, are split into systematic and residual issuer-specific components  using  a  factor  model approach. Systematic returns are based on historical simulation, and residual returns on a Monte Carlo simulation. VaR model profit or loss distribution is derived from the sum of systematic and residual returns in such a way that we consistently capture systematic and residual risk. Correlations among risk factors are implicitly captured via a historical simulation approach. When modeling  risk  factor  returns  we  consider  the  stationarity properties of the historical time series of risk factor changes. Depending on the stationarity properties of the risk factors within a given factor class, we model the factor returns using absolute returns or logarithmic returns. Risk factor return distributions are updated fortnightly.\n\nOur VaR model does not have full revaluation capability, but we source full revaluation grids and sensitivities from front-office systems, enabling us to capture material non-linear profit or loss effects.\n\nWe use a single VaR model for both internal management purposes  and  determining  market  risk  RWA,  although  we consider  different  confidence  levels  and  time  horizons.  For internal  management  purposes,  we  establish  risk  limits  and measure exposures using VaR at a 95% confidence level with a 1-day holding period, aligned to the way we consider the risks associated with our trading activities. The regulatory measure of market risk used to underpin the market risk capital requirement under Basel III requires a measure equivalent to a 99% confidence level using a 10-day holding period. To calculate a 10-day holding period  VaR,  we  use  10-day  risk  factor  returns,  with  all observations equally weighted.\n\nAdditionally, the portfolio population for management and regulatory VaR is slightly different. The one for regulatory VaR meets regulatory requirements for inclusion in regulatory VaR. Management VaR includes a broader range of positions. For example, regulatory VaR excludes credit spread risks from the securitization  portfolio,  which  are  treated  instead  under  the securitization approach for regulatory purposes.",

        "page_content": "## VaR limitations\n\nAudited | Actual realized market risk losses may differ from those implied by VaR for a variety of reasons.\n\n- -VaR is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and may not indicate potential losses beyond this confidence level.\n- -The 1-day time horizon used for VaR for internal management purposes (10-day for regulatory VaR) may not fully capture market risk of positions that cannot be closed out or hedged within the specified period.\n- -In some cases, VaR calculations approximate the effect of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and portfolios. This may happen due to the number of risk factors included in the VaR model needing to be limited.\n- -Effects of extreme market movements are subject to estimation errors, which may result from non-linear risk sensitivities, and the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in VaR calculations.\n- -Using a five-year window means sudden increases in market volatility will tend not to increase VaR as quickly as the use of shorter historical observation periods, but such increases will affect VaR for a longer period of time. Similarly, after periods of increased volatility, as markets stabilize, VaR predictions will remain more conservative for a period of time influenced by the length of the historical observation period.\n\nSVaR is subject to the limitations noted for VaR above, but the use of one-year data sets avoids the smoothing effect of the fiveyear data set used for VaR and the absence of the five-year window gives a longer history of potential loss events. Therefore, although the significant period of stress during the 2007-2009\n\nfinancial crisis is no longer contained in the historical five-year period used for management and regulatory VaR, SVaR continues to use that data. This approach aims to reduce the procyclicality of the regulatory capital requirements for market risks.\n\nWe recognize that no single measure can encompass all risks associated with a position or portfolio. Thus we use a set of metrics with both overlapping and complementary characteristics to  create  a  holistic  framework  that  aims  to  ensure  material completeness  of  risk  identification  and  measurement.  As  a statistical aggregate risk measure, VaR supplements our liquidityadjusted stress and comprehensive stress testing frameworks.\n\nWe also have a framework to identify and quantify potential risks not fully captured by our VaR model and refer to such risks as risks not in VaR. The framework underpins these potential risks with regulatory capital, calculated as a multiple of regulatory VaR and stressed VaR. \uf070\n\n## Backtesting of VaR\n\nVaR backtesting is a performance measurement process in which a 1-day VaR prediction is compared with the realized 1-day profit or  loss  (P&L).  We  compute  backtesting  VaR  using  a  99% confidence level and 1-day holding period for the regulatory VaR population. Since 99% VaR at UBS is defined as a risk measure that operates on the lower tail of the P&L distribution, 99% backtesting  VaR  is  a  negative  number.  Backtesting  revenues exclude non-trading revenues, such as valuation reserves, fees and commissions, and revenues from intraday trading, to provide for a like-for-like comparison. A backtesting exception occurs when backtesting revenues are lower than the previous day's backtesting VaR.\n\n## )TQWRglyph<c=28,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>FGXGNQROGPVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>QHglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>TGIWNCVQT[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>DCEMVGUVKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>TGXGPWGU\u0095glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CEVWCNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>VTCFKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>TGXGPWGU\u008eglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>CICKPUVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>DCEMVGUVKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>8C4\u008f glyph<c=10,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=19,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=15,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>FC[glyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=27,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=27,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=7,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>EQP\u0182FGPEGglyph<c=11,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- glyph<c=19,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold> 'ZENWFGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>PQPglyph<c=15,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VTCFKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGXGPWGUglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>UWEJglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>XCNWCVKQPglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGUGTXGUglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>EQOOKUUKQPUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>HGGUglyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGXGPWGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>HTQOglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>KPVTCFC[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VTCFKPIglyph<c=16,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light> glyph<c=20,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold> +PENWFGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>DCEMVGUVKPIglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGXGPWGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGXGPWGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>HTQOglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light> KPVTCFC[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VTCFKPIglyph<c=16,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light> glyph<c=21,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Bold> glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>$CUGFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>QPglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>$CUGNglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>+++glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>TGIWNCVQT[glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>8C4glyph<c=14,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>GZENWFGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>%8#glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>RQUKVKQPUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CPFglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VJGKTglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>GNKIKDNGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>JGFIGUglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>YJKEJglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>CTGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>UWDLGEVglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VQglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>VJGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>UVCPFCNQPGglyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>%8#glyph<c=2,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>EJCTIGglyph<c=16,font=/GEXIVA+FrutigerLTCom-Light>",

        "page_content": "Statistically, given the 99% confidence level, 2 or 3 backtesting exceptions a year can be expected. More than 4 exceptions could indicate that the VaR model is not performing appropriately, as could too few exceptions over a long period. However, as noted for VaR limitations above, a sudden increase (or decrease) in market volatility relative to the five-year window could lead to a higher (or lower) number of exceptions. Therefore, Group-level backtesting  exceptions  are  investigated,  as  are  exceptional positive backtesting revenues, with the results reported to senior business management, the Group CRO and the Group Chief Market & Treasury Risk Officer. Internal and external auditors and relevant regulators are also informed of backtesting exceptions.\n\nThe 'Group: development of regulatory backtesting revenues and actual trading revenues against backtesting VaR' chart on the  previous  page  shows  the  12-month  development  of backtesting VaR against the Group's backtesting revenues and actual trading revenues for 2021. The chart shows both the 99% and  the  1%  backtesting  VaR.  The  asymmetry  between  the negative and positive tails is due to the long gamma risk profile historically run in the Investment Bank.\n\nThe actual trading revenues include backtesting and intraday revenues.\n\nThe number of negative backtesting exceptions within a 250business-day window increased to 4 from 3 by the end of the year. As these backtesting exceptions remained below 5, the FINMA VaR multiplier for market risk RWA remained unchanged at 3.0 as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## VaR model confirmation\n\nAs well as for regulatory-purposes backtesting described above, we conduct extended backtesting for internal model confirmation purposes. This includes observing model performance across the entire P&L distribution (not just the tails), and at multiple levels within the business division hierarchies.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n\n## VaR model developments in 2021\n\nAudited  | There  were  no  material  changes  to  the  VaR  model in 2021. \uf070\n\n## Future market risk-related regulatory capital developments\n\nIn January 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) published the final standards on the minimum capital requirements for market risk (the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book). We do not expect these standards to become mandatory in Switzerland until after the BCBS target effective date of 1 July 2024.\n\nKey elements of the revised market risk framework include: (i) changes  to  the  internal  model-based  approach,  including changes to the model approval and performance measurement process; (ii) changes to the standardized approach with the aim of it being a credible fallback method for an internal model-based approach; and (iii) a revised boundary between trading book and banking book. UBS maintains a close dialogue with FINMA to discuss  the  implementation  objectives  in  more  detail  and  to provide a smooth transition of the capital regime for market risk.\n\nIn September 2021 FINMA mandated UBS to hold an RWA add-on for the omission of time decay in regulatory VaR and SVaR. The add-on reflects the outcome of discussions with FINMA regarding our regulatory VaR model, which started in late 2019. The integration of time decay into the regulatory VaR model, which would replace the add-on, is subject to further discussions between FINMA and UBS.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk-weighted assets' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the development of RWA including the regulatory add-on\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Regulatory and legal developments' and 'Risk factors' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book disclosure\n\nOur financial reports' interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) disclosure is aligned to the Pillar 3 requirements set by FINMA Circular '2019/2 Interest Rate Risk - Banks,' which sets minimum standards for measuring, managing, monitoring and controlling IRRBB. In particular, the economic value of equity (EVE) sensitivity is assessed under the six regulatory rate-shock scenarios set in the FINMA circular, which are currency-specific and not subject to flooring.\n\n## Sources of interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nAudited | IRRBB arises from balance sheet positions such as Loans and  advances  to  banks , Loans  and  advances  to  customers , Financial assets at fair value not held for trading , Financial assets measured at amortized cost , Customer deposits , Debt issued measured at amortized cost , and derivatives, including those subject to hedge accounting. Fair value changes to these positions may affect other comprehensive income (OCI) or the income statement, depending on their accounting treatment. 50 75 100 125 150 50 75 100 125 150\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-25\n\n-25\n\n-50\n\n-50",

        "page_content": "Our largest banking book interest rate exposures arise from customer  deposits  and  lending  products  in  Global  Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. The inherent interest rate risks are generally transferred from Global Wealth Management  and  Personal  &  Corporate  Banking  to  Group Treasury, to manage them centrally. This enables the netting of interest  rate  risks  across  different  sources,  while  leaving  the originating  businesses  with  commercial  margin  and  volume management. The residual interest rate risk is mainly hedged with interest rate swaps, to the vast majority of which we apply hedge accounting. Short-term exposures and high-quality liquid assets classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading are hedged with derivatives accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. Long-term fixed-rate debt issued is hedged with interest rate swaps designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships.\n\n## Risk management and governance\n\nIRRBB is measured using several metrics, the most relevant of which are the following.\n\n- -Interest  rate  sensitivities  to  changes  in  yield  curves  are calculated as changes in the present value of future cash flows irrespective of accounting treatment. These are also the key risk  factors  for  statistical  and  stress-based  measures,  e.g., value-at-risk and stress scenarios (including EVE sensitivity), and are measured and reported daily. EVE sensitivity is the exposure arising from the most adverse regulatory interest rate scenario  after  netting  across  currencies.  As  well  as  the regulatory measure, we apply an internal EVE sensitivity metric that includes additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments and modeled interest rate duration assigned to equity, goodwill and real estate.\n- -Net interest income (NII) sensitivity assesses NII change over a set  time  horizon  compared  with  baseline  NII,  which  we internally calculate by assuming interest rates in all currencies develop according to their market-implied forward rates and assuming  constant  business volumes  and  no  specific management actions. This internally calculated NII sensitivity, which,  unlike  the  FINMA  Pillar 3  disclosure  requirements, includes the contribution from cash held at central banks, is measured and reported monthly.\n\nWe actively manage IRRBB, aiming to reduce the volatility of NII, while keeping the EVE sensitivity within set internal risk limits. EVE and NII sensitivity are monitored against limits and triggers, at consolidated and significant legal entity levels. We also assess the sensitivity of EVE and NII under stressed market conditions by applying a suite of parallel and non-parallel interest rate scenarios, as well as specific economic scenarios.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and, where relevant,  ALCOs  at  a  legal  entity  level  perform  independent oversight over the management of IRRBB, which is also subject to Group Internal Audit and model governance.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Group Internal Audit' in the 'Corporate governance' section of this report and to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information\n\n## Key modeling assumptions\n\nThe cash flows from customer deposits and lending products used in calculation of EVE sensitivity exclude commercial margins and other spread components, are aggregated by daily time buckets and are discounted using risk-free rates. Our external issuances are  discounted  using  UBS's  senior  debt  curve,  and  capital instruments are modeled to the first call date. NII sensitivity, which includes commercial margins, is calculated over a one-year time horizon, assuming constant balance sheet structure and volumes, and  considers  the  flooring  effect  of  embedded  interest  rate options.\n\nThe average repricing maturity of non-maturing deposits and loans is determined via replication portfolio strategies designed to protect  product  margin.  Optimal  replicating  portfolios  are determined at granular currency- and product-specific levels by simulating  and  applying  a  real-world  market  rate  model  to historically calibrated client rate and volume models.\n\nWe  use  an  econometric  prepayment  model  to  forecast prepayment rates on US mortgage loans in UBS Bank USA and agency  mortgage-backed  securities  (MBSs)  held  in  various liquidity portfolios of UBS Americas Holding LLC consolidated. These prepayment rates are used to forecast both mortgage loan and MBS balances under various macroeconomic scenarios. The prepayment model is used for a variety of purposes, including risk management and regulatory stress testing. Swiss mortgages and fixed-term deposits generally do not carry similar optionality, due to prepayment and early redemption penalties. \uf070",

        "page_content": "## Effect of interest rate changes on shareholders' equity and CET1 capital\n\nThe 'Accounting and capital effect of changes in interest rates' table below shows the effects on shareholders' equity and CET1 capital of gains and losses from changes in interest rates in the main banking book positions. For instruments held at fair value, changes in interest rates result in an immediate fair value gain or loss, recognized either in the income statement or through OCI. Typically, increases in interest rates would lead to immediate reductions in the value of our long-term assets held at fair value, but we would expect such reductions to be offset over time through higher NII on core banking products.\n\nFor assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost, changes in interest rates do not result in changes in the carrying amount of  the  instruments,  but  could  affect  the  amount  of  interest income or expense recognized over time in the income statement.\n\nIn addition to the differing accounting treatments, banking book positions have different sensitivities to different points on yield curves. For example, portfolios of debt securities, whether\n\nmeasured at amortized cost or at fair value, and interest rate swaps, whether designated as cash flow hedges or transacted as economic hedges, are generally more sensitive to changes in longer-duration interest rates, whereas deposits and a significant portion of loans contributing to NII are more sensitive to shortterm rates. These factors are important, as yield curves may not shift on a parallel basis and could, for example, exhibit an initial steepening followed by a flattening over time.\n\nDue to the accounting treatment and yield curve sensitivities outlined above, in a rising rate scenario we would expect to have an initial decrease in shareholders' equity, as a result of fair value losses recognized in OCI. This would be compensated over time by increased NII, as increases in interest rates affect the shorter end of the yield curve in particular. The effect on CET1 capital would be less pronounced, as gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized for regulatory  capital  purposes.  Fair  value  losses  on  instruments designated at fair value should be offset by economic hedges.\n\n## Accounting and capital effect of changes in interest rates 1\n\n|                                                                     | R Reeccooggnniittiioonn   | R Reeccooggnniittiioonn                       | S Shhaarreehhoollddeerrss''  eeqquuiittyy   | S Shhaarreehhoollddeerrss''  eeqquuiittyy   | C CEETT11  ccaappiittaall   | C CEETT11  ccaappiittaall   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                     | T Tiimmiinngg             | I Innccoommee  ssttaatteemmeenntt  //  OOCCII | Gains                                       | Losses                                      | Gains                       | Losses                      |\n| Loans and deposits at amortized cost 2,3                            | Gradual                   | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Other financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost 2 | Gradual                   | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Debt issued measured at amortized cost 2,3                          | Gradual                   | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Receivables and payables from securities financing transactions 2   | Gradual                   | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Financial assets at fair value not held for trading                 | Immediate                 | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income   | Immediate                 | OCI                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           |                             | \uf06c                           |\n| Derivatives designated as cash flow hedges                          | Immediate                 | OCI 4                                         | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           |                             |                             |\n| Derivatives designated as fair value hedges 5                       | Immediate                 | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n| Derivatives transacted as economic hedges                           | Immediate                 | Income statement                              | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                                           | \uf06c                           | \uf06c                           |\n\n1 1 Refer to the 'Reconciliation of IFRS equity to Swiss SRB common equity tier 1 capital' table in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the differences between shareholders' equity and CET1 capital. 2 2 For fixed-rate financial instruments, changes in interest rates affect the income statement when these instruments roll over and reprice. 3 3 For hedge accounted items, a fair value adjustment is applied in line with the treatment of the hedging derivatives. 4 4 Excluding hedge ineffectiveness that is recognized in the income statement in accordance with IFRS. 5 5 The fair value of the derivatives is offset by the fair value adjustment of the hedged items. Under the fair value hedge program applied to cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt, the foreign currency basis spread is excluded from the hedge designation and accounted for through OCI, which is included in CET1.\n\n## Net interest income sensitivity\n\nThe NII sensitivity of Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate  Banking  is  assessed  using  a  number  of  scenarios assuming parallel and non-parallel shifts in yield curves, with various degrees of severity. The results are compared with a baseline  NII,  calculated  assuming  that  interest  rates  in  all currencies develop according to their market-implied forward rates and under the assumption of constant business volumes and no specific management actions.\n\nIn addition to the above scenario analysis, we monitor NII sensitivity to immediate parallel shocks of -200 and +200 basis points against the defined thresholds, under the assumption of constant balance sheet volume and structure.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the projected NII was approximately 14% lower than the baseline NII under a parallel shock of -200 basis points, whereas under a parallel +200-basis-point shock it was approximately 57% higher than the baseline NII.\n\nTo shelter our NII level from the persistently low and negative interest rate environment, in particular in Swiss francs, we rely on self-funding our lending businesses through our deposit base in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking, along with appropriate additional adjustments to our interest\n\nrate-linked product pricing. The loss of such equilibrium on the balance sheet, for example due to unattractive pricing relative to peers for either mortgages or deposits, could lead to our NII decreasing  in  a  persistently  low  and  negative  interest  rate environment. As we assume constant business volumes, these risks do not appear in the aforementioned interest rate scenarios.\n\nMoreover,  should  the  low  and  negative  interest  rate environment  worsen,  our  NII  could  come  under  additional pressure and we could face additional costs for holding our Swiss franc HQLA portfolio. A reduction of the Swiss National Bank's deposit exemption threshold for banks would also reduce our NII, as we might not be able to offset higher costs for our cash holdings, for example by passing on some of the costs to our depositors. Should euro interest rates also decline further, that could likewise increase liquidity costs and put NII generated from euro-denominated loans and deposits under pressure. Depending on the overall economic and market environment, sustained and significant  negative  rates  could  also  lead  to  Global  Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking clients paying down their loans, along with reducing any excess cash they hold with us as deposits. That would reduce the underlying business volume and lower our NII accordingly.",

        "page_content": "The NII impact of a net decrease in deposits would depend on various factors, including the currency, its interest rate level and the balance sheet situation, as the impact could be offset by a reduction  in  negative-yielding  liquidity  portfolios  or  require alternative funding. If funding were required, the cost would also significantly depend on term and nature of replacement funding, whether such funding is raised in wholesale markets or from swapping with available other currency-denominated funding. Furthermore, imbalances leading to an excess deposit position could require additional investments at negative yields, which our excess deposit balance charging mechanisms might not be able to sufficiently compensate for.\n\n## Economic value sensitivity\n\nAudited  | Interest rate risk in the banking book is subject to a regulatory EVE sensitivity threshold of 15% of tier 1 capital.

Own credit\n\nWe are exposed to changes in UBS's own credit reflected in the valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value when UBS's own credit risk would be considered by market participants, except for fully collateralized liabilities or other obligations for which it is established market practice to not include an owncredit component.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 21 Fair value measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about own credit\n\n## Structural foreign exchange risk\n\nUpon  consolidation,  assets  and  liabilities  held  in  foreign operations are translated into US dollars at the closing foreign exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Value changes (in US dollars)  of  non-US  dollar  assets  or  liabilities  due  to  foreign exchange movements are recognized in OCI and therefore affect shareholders' equity and CET1 capital.\n\nGroup Treasury uses strategies to manage this foreign currency exposure, including matched funding of assets and liabilities and net investment hedging.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about our exposure to and management of structural foreign exchange risk\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\n## Equity investments\n\nAudited | We make direct investments in a variety of entities and buy equity holdings in both listed and unlisted companies, for a variety of purposes, including investments such as exchange and clearing house memberships held to support our business activities. We may also make investments in funds that we manage in order to fund or seed them at inception or to demonstrate that our interests align with those of investors. We also buy, and are sometimes required by agreement to buy, securities and units from funds that we have sold to clients.\n\nincome should interest rates decrease. The reported interest rate sensitivity excludes the AT1 capital instruments, as per FINMA Pillar 3  disclosure  requirements,  with  a  sensitivity  of  USD 4.5 million per basis point, and our equity, goodwill and real estate, with a modeled sensitivity of USD 22.1 million per basis point, of which USD 15.6 million and USD 5.5 million are attributable to the US dollar and the Swiss franc portfolios, respectively.\n\nThe most adverse of the six FINMA interest rate scenarios would be the 'Parallel up' scenario, which would result in a change in the economic value of equity of negative USD 6.0 billion, representing a pro forma reduction of 10.0% of tier 1 capital, which would be well below the regulatory outlier test of 15% of tier 1 capital. The immediate effect of the 'Parallel up' scenario on tier 1 capital as of 31 December 2021 would be a reduction of 1.8%, or USD 1.1 billion, arising from the part of our banking book that is measured at fair value through profit or loss and from Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income . Over time this scenario would have a positive effect on net interest income. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 11 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Group performance' section of this report for more information about sensitivity to interest rate movements",

Equity investments are generally intended to be held for the medium or long term and may be subject to lock-up agreements. For these reasons, we generally do not control these exposures by using market risk measures  applied  to  trading  activities.  However,  such  equity investments are subject to a different range of controls, including preapproval of new investments by business management and Risk  Control,  portfolio  and  concentration  limits,  and  regular monitoring and reporting to senior management. They are also included in our Group-wide statistical and stress testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite framework.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, we held equity investments and investment fund units totaling USD 3.0 billion, of which USD 1.8 billion was classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading and USD 1.2 billion as Investments in associates . \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 21 Fair value measurement' and 'Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about the classification of financial\n- instruments\n\n## Debt investments\n\nAudited | Debt investments classified as Financial assets measured at fair value through OCI as of 31 December 2021 were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Equity , and can broadly be categorized as money market instruments and debt securities primarily held for statutory, regulatory or liquidity reasons.\n\nThe  risk  control  framework  applied  to  debt  instruments classified as Financial assets measured at fair value through OCI depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which we hold them.

This can result from falls in the value of a plan's assets or in the investment returns, increases in defined benefit obligations, or combinations of the above.\n\nImportant risk factors affecting the fair value of pension plans' assets include equity market returns, interest rates, bond yields, and real estate prices. Important risk factors affecting the present value of expected future benefit payments include high-grade bond yields, interest rates, inflation rates, and life expectancy.\n\nPension risk is included in our Group-wide statistical and stress testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite framework.

        "page_content": "## Country risk\n\n## Country risk framework\n\nCountry risk includes all country-specific events occurring in a sovereign  jurisdiction  that  may  lead  to  impairment  of  UBS's exposures. It may take the form of: sovereign risk, which is the ability and willingness of a government to honor its financial commitments; transfer risk, which arises if a counterparty or issuer cannot acquire foreign currencies following a moratorium by a central bank on foreign exchange transfers; or 'other' country risk. 'Other' country risk may manifest itself through, on the one hand, increased and multiple counterparty and issuer default risk (systemic risk) and, on the other hand, events that may affect a country's  standing,  such  as  adverse  shocks  affecting  political stability or institutional and / or legal frameworks. We have a wellestablished risk control framework to assess the risk profiles of all countries where we have exposure.\n\nWe assign a country rating to each country, which reflects our view of the country's creditworthiness and of the probability of a country risk event occurring. Country ratings are mapped to statistically derived default probabilities, described under 'Probability  of  default'  in  this  section.  We  use  this  internal analysis to set the credit ratings of governments and central banks, estimate the probability of a transfer event occurring, and establish  rules  on  how  aspects  of  country  risk  should  be incorporated in counterparty ratings of non-sovereign entities domiciled in the respective country.\n\nCountry ratings are also used to define our risk appetite and risk  exposure  to  foreign  countries.  A  country  risk  limit  (i.e., maximum  aggregate  exposure)  applies to exposures to counterparties or issuers of securities and financial investments in the given foreign country. We may limit the extension of credit, transactions in traded products or positions in securities based on a country risk ceiling even if our exposure to a counterparty is otherwise acceptable.\n\nFor internal measurement and control of country risk, we also consider the financial effect of market disruptions arising prior to, during and after a country crisis. These may take the form of a severe deterioration in a country's debt, equity or other asset markets or a sharp depreciation of its currency. We use stress testing to assess potential financial effects of severe country or sovereign crises. This involves the developing of plausible stress scenarios for combined stress testing and the identification of countries  that  may  potentially  be  subject  to  a  crisis  event, determining  potential  losses  and  making  assumptions  about recovery rates depending on the types of credit transactions involved and their economic importance to the affected countries.\n\nOur exposures to market risks are subject to regular stress tests covering  major  global  scenarios,  which  are  also  used  for combined stress testing, where we apply market shock factors to equity indices, interest rates and currency rates in all relevant countries and consider the potential liquidity of the instruments.\n\n## Country risk exposure\n\n## Country risk exposure measure\n\nThe presentation of country risk follows our internal risk view, where the basis for measuring exposures depends on the product category in which we classified the exposures. In addition to the classification  of  exposures  into  banking  products  and  traded products, covered in 'Credit risk profile of the Group' in this section, in the trading inventory we classify issuer risk on securities such as bonds and equities, as well as risk relating to underlying reference assets for derivative positions.\n\nAs we manage the trading inventory on a net basis, we net the value of long positions against short positions with the same underlying issuer. Net exposures are, however, floored at zero per issuer in the figures presented in the following tables. As a result, we do not recognize potentially offsetting benefits of certain hedges and short positions across issuers.\n\nWe  do  not  recognize  any  expected  recovery  values  when reporting country exposures as exposure before hedges, except for  risk-reducing  effects  of  master  netting  agreements  and collateral held in either cash or portfolios of diversified marketable securities, which we deduct from the positive exposure values. Within  banking  products  and  traded  products,  risk-reducing effects of credit protection are taken into account on a notional basis when determining the net of hedge exposures.\n\n## Country risk exposure allocation\n\nIn general, exposures are shown against the country of domicile of the contractual counterparty or the issuer of the security. For some counterparties whose economic substance in terms of assets or source of revenues is primarily located in a different country, the exposure is allocated to the risk domicile of those assets or revenues.\n\nWe apply a specific approach for banking products exposures to branches of banks that are located in a country other than the legal entity's domicile. In such cases, exposures are recorded in full against the country of domicile of the counterparty and additionally  in  full  against  the  country  where  the  branch  is located.\n\nIn  the  case  of  derivatives,  we  show  counterparty  risk associated with positive replacement value (PRV) against the counterparty's  country  of  domicile  (presented  within  traded products). In addition, risk associated with an instantaneous fall in value of underlying reference assets to zero (assuming no recovery) is shown against the country of domicile of the issuer of the reference asset (presented within trading inventory). This approach allows us to capture both counterparty and, where applicable, issuer elements of risk arising from derivatives and applies comprehensively for all derivatives, including single-name credit default swaps (CDSs) and other credit derivatives.",

        "page_content": "CDSs are primarily bought and sold in relation to our trading businesses, and, to a much lesser degree, used to hedge credit valuation adjustments (CVAs). Holding CDSs for credit default protection does not necessarily protect the buyer of protection against losses, as contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a hedge of default risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the contractual terms under which a given CDS was written. Generally, only the occurrence of credit events as defined by the CDS contract's terms (which  may  include,  among  other  events,  failure  to  pay, restructuring  or  bankruptcy)  results  in  payments  under  the purchased  credit  protection  contracts.  For  CDS  contracts  on sovereign  obligations,  repudiation  can  also  be  deemed  as  a default event. The determination as to whether a credit event has occurred  is  made  by  the  relevant  International  Swaps  and Derivatives Association (ISDA) determination committees (composed of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS and the facts and circumstances surrounding the event.\n\n## Top 20 country risk exposures\n\nThe table below shows our 20 largest country exposures by product type, excluding our home country, as of 31 December 2021 compared with 31 December 2020.\n\nCompared with the prior year, our net exposure to the UK increased by USD 8.8 billion, driven by central bank exposures due to treasury activities. Net exposure to the US increased by USD 6.3 billion, solely driven by banking products, largely related to nostro balances  at  the  Federal  Reserve  due  to  treasury  activities, mortgages and Investment Bank loans. Those increases in the US were partly offset by tradable assets related to treasury activities. Net  exposure  to  Australia  increased  by  USD 2.9  billion, predominantly  driven  by  trading  inventory  due  to  loan underwriting projects and central bank exposures. Net exposure to  Germany  decreased  by  USD 2.8  billion,  driven  by  trading inventory due to loan underwriting projects and sovereign issuer risk.  Net  exposure  to  China  decreased  by  USD 2.0  billion, predominantly driven by trading inventory across issuer risk and\n\nmargin loans, as well as banking products. Net exposure to France decreased by USD 1.0 billion, driven by trading inventory due to treasury activities.\n\nBased on the sovereign rating categories, as of 31 December 2021, 84% of our emerging market country exposure was rated investment grade, compared with 83% as of 31 December 2020.\n\n## Russia\n\nOur direct country risk exposure to Russia contributed USD 634 million to our total emerging market exposure of USD 20.9 billion as of 31 December 2021. This includes trade finance exposures in Personal & Corporate Banking, a single loan in the Investment Bank with a non-Russian entity with key facilities spread globally including Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, Nostro  and  cash  accounts  balances,  issuer  risk  on  trading inventory within the Investment Bank, and derivatives within the Investment Bank. These exposures have been reduced since yearend 2021. Not included in this figure are net assets held in our Russian subsidiary, with a net asset value of USD 51 million. UBS is  also  currently  monitoring  settlement  risk  on  certain  open transactions with Russian banks and non-bank counterparties or Russian  underlyings,  as  market  closures,  the  imposition  of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures.\n\nAs of 3 March 2022, UBS also had approximately USD 0.2 billion  exposure  arising  from  reliance  on  Russian  assets  as collateral on Lombard lending and other secured financing in Global Wealth Management.\n\nAs of 3 March 2022, we identified a small number of Global Wealth Management clients subject to the recently introduced sanctions, with total loans outstanding of under USD 10 million.\n\nOur market risk exposure to Russia as of 3 March 2022 was limited.\n\nWe had no material direct country risk exposures to Ukraine or to Belarus as of 31 December 2021 and no material reliance on Ukrainian or to Belarusian collateral within our Lombard portfolio.",

Sustainability and climate risks may manifest as credit, market, liquidity or operational risks for UBS and can result in financial or reputational impacts for the firm. They may also negatively impact the value of investments. The management of sustainability and climate risks is gaining importance amid a global drive to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs) and transition to net zero, as defined by the Paris Agreement. In addition, regulators across jurisdictions  increasingly  seek  to  understand  the  potential financial impacts of climate change. Our broad and wide-ranging SCR policy framework governs client and supplier relationships, applies firm-wide to all activities, and is integrated in management practices and control principles. The SCR framework is embedded in our standard risk, compliance and operations processes and applied through:\n\n- -risk identification and measurement;\n- -risk monitoring and appetite setting;\n- -risk management and control; and\n- -risk reporting.\n\nThe  aforementioned  processes  include  client  onboarding, transaction due diligence, product development and investment decision processes, own operations, supply chain management, and  portfolio  reviews.  This  framework  is  geared  toward identifying clients, transactions or suppliers potentially in breach of our standards or otherwise subject to significant controversies related to sustainability, human rights or climate change.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk policy framework' in appendix 6 to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n\n## Climate risk\n\nClimate risk can arise either from changing climate conditions (physical  risks)  or  from  efforts  to  mitigate  climate  change (transition risks). The physical and transition risks from a changing climate contribute to a structural change across economies and consequently can affect banks and the financial sector as a whole through financial and non-financial impacts.\n\nIn order to protect our clients' assets and our own assets from climate-related risks, we have established a climate risk program to further integrate climate risk into the firm's risk management framework and standard processes. The program follows a multiyear roadmap to address regulatory expectations and is engaging with stakeholders and experts across the firm and externally to further develop climate risk methodologies, deliver on climate stress test exercises, and build capacity to respond to climate risk management expectations.\n\nWe currently identify and manage climate risk in our own operations, our balance sheet, client assets and the supply chain. We have continually reduced our exposure to carbon-related assets and  advanced  our  multi-year  efforts to develop methodologies that enable robust and transparent disclosure of climate metrics. This work supports our efforts to ensure that we are  prepared  to  respond  to  increased  climate  risk-related regulatory requirements, align our disclosure with the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD) recommendations and collaborate within the financial sector to close gaps.\n\nWe approach climate risk identification through climate risk heatmaps, developed in collaboration with the United Nations Environment  Programme  Finance  Initiative  (UNEP  FI)  TCFD working group.\n\nAs part of this effort, we have defined an inventory of climatesensitive sectors based on elevated climate risk ratings defined by the TCFD, regulators and rating agencies. We initially disclosed our exposure to climate sensitive sectors (transition risks) in our Annual Report 2020. Over the course of 2021, we have refined the  disclosure  of  transition  risks  and  introduced  an  initial disclosure of physical risks. We summarize our current exposure to climate-sensitive sectors for both risk types in the table on the next page.\n\nExposures may appear either under one or under both of the risk types, as the physical and transition risk methodologies are distinct in their approach and application and should not be added up as one total exposure figure. Climate risk analysis is a novel area of research, and, as the methodologies, tools and data availability improve, we will further develop our risk identification and measurement approaches.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Taking action on a net-zero future - our climate report' in the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information",

Wealth Management corporate lending to customers represents 1.1% of all on- and off-balance sheet loans and advances to customers, and is not rated. 3 3 Reported as IFRS9 expected credit loss (ECL) calculation, and represents both on-balance sheet: total loans and advances to customers and off-balance sheet: guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments (within the scope of ECL). Physical risk exposures include USD ~4 billion in loans backed by real estate. 4 4 The table includes only those sector exposures that are defined as climate-sensitive. Climate-sensitive sectors defined as business activities rated as having high, moderately high or moderate vulnerability to transition and physical risks. Transition risk methodology was initially developed in collaboration with UNEP FI TCFD working group and disclosed in Phase II 'From disclosure to action - a guide to implementing the TCFD framework within financial institutions' report. Physical risk methodology is based on country, sectoral and value chain risk factors derived from a range of academic and expert sources. Both methodologies have been adapted internally and enhanced.\n\nClimate  risk  heatmaps  enable  us  to  use  a  materiality-driven approach when defining our climate risk management strategy by:\n\n- -helping us to identify concentrations of exposure with high climate  risk  vulnerability,  which,  in  turn,  enables  resource prioritization for detailed risk analysis and management action;\n- -supporting a client-centric strategy in order to best assist clients that may benefit from UBS products and services to support their climate strategies; and\n- -providing  information  to  senior  management  to  support decision making and the provision of external disclosure to stakeholders.\n\nOur  climate  risk  heatmaps  rate  cross-sectoral  credit  risk exposure to climate sensitivity, from high to low, through a risk segmentation process. The transition risk methodology, reflected in the climate risk heatmap on the next page, divides economic sectors into segments with similar risk characteristics and rates those  segments  according  to  their  vulnerability  to  mitigative climate  policies,  low-carbon  technology  risks  and  revenue  or demand shifts under an aggressive approach to meeting the wellbelow-2\u02daC  Paris  goal.  The  physical  risk  methodology  groups corporate counterparties based on exposure to key physical risk factors, through rating sectoral, geographic, and value chain vulnerabilities  in  a  climate  change  trajectory  in  which  no additional policy action is taken. Counterparties are assigned a climate vulnerability rating based on the primary industry code (Global Industry Classification Standard, GICS) and risk domicile in UBS data systems.\n\n- \u203a For our physical risk heatmap, refer to 'Taking action on a netzero future - our climate report' in the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors",

Novel in-house scenario analyses have been followed by a series of assessments performed through industry collaborations in order to harmonize approaches in addressing methodological and data gaps. We have  performed  both  top-down  balance  sheet  stress  testing (across the firm) and targeted bottom-up analyses of specific sector  exposures  covering  short-,  mid-  and  long-term  time horizons. Starting in 2021, UBS participates in regulatory scenario analysis and stress test exercises, including the Bank of England's\n\n'2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario: Financial risks from climate change' and the European Central Bank's climate stress test.

        "page_content": "## Non-financial risk\n\n## Key developments\n\nWe have identified seven non-financial risk themes as key to the firm for 2022. These are:\n\n- -digital transformation and cyber and operational resilience;\n- -use of data;\n- -new ways of working and change delivery;\n- -investor protection and market interaction;\n- -strategic growth initiatives and partnerships;\n- -the evolving nature of anti-money-laundering (AML) / knowyour-client (KYC) programs and sanctions; and\n- -environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.\n\nWe  are  continuing  our  efforts  regarding  innovation  and digitalization  to  create  value  for  our  clients.  As  part  of  the resulting transformation, we are focusing on timely changes to frameworks, including consideration of new or revised controls, working practices and oversight, with the aim of mitigating any new risks introduced, including those related to data ethics.\n\nIncreases in the sophistication of cyberattacks and frauds are noted worldwide, especially with ransomware attacks. To date, our security controls, regular communications to help employees stay alert to cyber threats while working remotely and enhanced monitoring of cyber threats have resulted in no cyber security incidents having a material effect on our operations during 2021. UBS continues to be vigilant, particularly in view of the potential for  intensifying  cyber  threats,  both  in  terms  of  volume  and sophistication, driven by current geopolitical events.\n\nOperational resilience continues to be a focus area for us, as well as for regulators globally. We have a global program to enhance our operational-resilience capabilities, including addressing developing regulatory requirements.\n\nThe  existing  resilience  built  into  our  operations  and  the effectiveness  of  our  business  continuity  management  and operational risk processes (including those for third-party service providers) have been critical in handling the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They have enabled us to maintain stable operations while  complying  with  governmental  measures  to  contain COVID-19;  continuing  to  serve  our  clients  without  material impact; and to support the safety and well-being of our staff.\n\nHybrid working arrangements can lead to increased conduct risk, inherent risk of fraudulent activities, potential increases in the number  of  suspicious  transactions  and  increased  information security risks. We have implemented additional monitoring and supervision intended to mitigate these risks. In addition, as we move to a post-pandemic new normal, changes to the work environment, including permanent hybrid and the introduction of agile  ways  of  working,  may  introduce  new  challenges  for supervision and monitoring.\n\nAchieving fair outcomes for our clients, upholding market integrity  and  cultivating  the  highest  standards  of  employee conduct are of critical importance to the firm. We maintain a conduct risk framework across our activities, which is designed to align  our  standards  and  conduct  with  these  objectives  and maintain momentum on fostering a strong culture.\n\nCompetition to find new business opportunities across the financial  services  industry,  both  for  firms  and  customers,  is increasing. Thus suitability risk, product selection, cross-divisional\n\nservice offerings, quality of advice and price transparency also remain areas of heightened focus for UBS and for the industry as a  whole,  as  low  interest  rates,  market  volatility  and  major legislative change programs (such as the Swiss Financial Services Act (FIDLEG) in Switzerland, Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) in the  US,  and  the  Markets  in  Financial  Instruments  Directive II (MiFID II) in the EU) all significantly affect the industry and require adjustments to control processes on a geographically aligned basis. We regularly monitor our suitability, product and conflicts of  interest  control  frameworks  to  assess  whether  they  are reasonably designed to facilitate adherence to applicable laws and regulatory expectations.\n\nCross-border risk remains an area of regulatory attention for global  financial  institutions,  with  a  strong  focus  on  fiscal transparency, as well as market access, particularly third-country market access into the European Economic Area. There is also an ongoing  high  level  of  attention  regarding  the  risk  that  tax authorities may, on the basis of new interpretations of existing law,  seek  to  impose  taxation  based  on  the  existence  of  a permanent  establishment.  We  maintain  a  series  of  controls designed to address these risks.\n\nFinancial crime, including money  laundering, terrorist financing,  sanctions  violations,  fraud,  bribery  and  corruption, continues to present a major risk, as technological innovation and geopolitical  developments  increase  the  complexity  of  doing business  and  heightened  regulatory  attention  continues.  An effective financial crime prevention program therefore remains essential  for  UBS.  Money  laundering  and  financial  fraud techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and geopolitical  volatility  makes  the  sanctions  landscape  more challenging, as new or novel sanctions may be imposed that require  complex  implementation  in  a  short  timeframe,  as evidenced  by  the  existing,  and  potential  escalation  of  new sanctions arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. New risks continue  to  emerge,  such  as  virtual  currencies  and  related activities or investments.\n\nIn the US, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a Cease and Desist Order against the firm in May 2018 relating to our US branch KYC and AML programs. In response, we initiated an extensive program for the purpose of ensuring sustainable remediation of US-relevant Bank Secrecy Act / AML issues across all our US legal entities. We introduced significant improvements to the framework between 2019 and 2021 and are continuing to implement  these.  We  believe  they  will  yield  the  planned enhancements to our AML controls.\n\nWe continued to focus on strategic enhancements to our global AML / KYC and sanctions programs to address evolving risk profiles and regulatory expectations, including the exploration of new technologies and more sophisticated monitoring.\n\nIn line with our firm-wide purpose, ESG topics and the risks related to them are high on our agenda, particularly considering the increasing regulatory focus on ESG disclosure, climate-related stress testing and greenwashing, as well as the potential for new and diverse regulations being deployed across jurisdictions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Sustainability and climate risk' in this section for more information about risks related to sustainability and climate risk",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk framework\n\nOperational risk is an inherent part of the firm's business. Losses can result from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external causes. UBS follows a Group-wide operational risk framework (an ORF) that establishes requirements for identifying, managing, assessing and mitigating operational, compliance  and  conduct  risks  to  achieve  an  agreed  balance between risk and return. It is built on the following pillars:\n\n- -classifying inherent risks through  the  operational  risk taxonomy, which defines the universe of material operational risks that can arise as a consequence of the firm's business activities and external factors;\n- -assessing the design and operating effectiveness of controls through the control assessment process;\n- -proactively  and  sustainably  remediating  identified  control deficiencies;\n- -defining  operational  risk  appetite  (including  a  financial operational risk appetite statement at Group, UBS AG and business division levels for operational risk events) through quantitative metrics and thresholds and qualitative measures, and assessing risk exposure against appetite; and\n- -assessing inherent and residual risk through risk assessment processes, and determining whether additional remediation plans are required to address identified deficiencies.\n\nDivisional Presidents are accountable for the effectiveness of operational risk management and for the robustness of the frontto-back control environment within their business divisions, and legal entity responsible executives are responsible for operational risk management within their legal entities. Group function heads are accountable for supporting the divisional Presidents and legal entity responsible executives of our legal entities in the discharge of this responsibility, by confirming completeness and effectiveness of the control environment and operational risk management within their Group functions. Collectively, divisional Presidents,  central  Group  function  heads  and  legal  entity responsible  executives  are  in  charge  of  implementing  the operational risk framework.\n\nCompliance & Operational Risk Control (C&ORC) is responsible for providing an independent and objective view of the adequacy of operational risk management across the Group, and ensuring that operational, compliance and conduct risks are understood, owned and managed in accordance with the firm's risk appetite. C&ORC-aligned  teams  sit  within  the  Group  Compliance, Regulatory  &  Governance  (GCRG)  function,  reporting  to  the Group  Chief  Compliance  and  Governance  Officer,  who  is  a member  of  the  Group  Executive  Board.  The  ORF  forms  the common  basis  for  managing  and  assessing  operational, compliance and conduct risk, and there are additional C&ORC activities  intended  to  ensure  UBS  is  able  to  demonstrate compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n\nIn  2021,  UBS  continued  to  review  and  enhance  the  ORF through  the  established  ORF  design  authority,  considering feedback and input from both internal and external stakeholders, including implementing Group-wide control portfolio analytics, supporting consistency across the control portfolio.\n\nAll functions within UBS are required to assess the design and operating effectiveness of their internal controls periodically. The output of these assessments forms the basis for the assessment and testing of internal controls over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 404 (SOX 404).\n\nKey control deficiencies identified during the internal control and risk assessment processes must be reported in the operational risk inventory, and sustainable remediation must be defined and executed. These control deficiencies are assigned to owners at senior  management  level  and  the  remediation  progress  is reflected  in  the  respective  managers'  annual  performance measurement  and  management  objectives.  To  assist  with prioritizing the most material control deficiencies and measuring aggregated risk exposure, irrespective of origin, a common rating methodology is applied across all three lines of defense, as well as by external audit.",

        "page_content": "## Advanced measurement approach model\n\nThe operational risk framework outlined above underpins the calculation  of  regulatory  capital  for  operational  risk,  which enables us to quantify operational risk and define effective risk mitigating  management  incentives  as  part  of  the  related operational  risk  capital  allocation  approach  to  the  business divisions.\n\nWe measure Group operational risk exposure and calculate operational risk regulatory capital using the advanced measurement  approach  (AMA)  in  accordance  with  FINMA requirements.\n\nAn  entity-specific  AMA  model  has  been  applied  for  UBS Switzerland  AG,  while  for  other  regulated  entities  the  basic indicators or standardized approaches are adopted for regulatory capital in agreement with local regulators. Also, the methodology of the Group AMA is leveraged for entity-specific Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Processes.\n\nCurrently, the model includes 16 AMA units of measure (UoM), which are aligned with our operational risk taxonomy as closely as possible. Frequency and severity distributions are calibrated for each of the model's UoM. The modeled distribution functions for both frequency and severity are used to generate the annual loss distribution. The resulting 99.9% quantile of the overall annual operational risk loss distribution across all UoM determines the required regulatory capital. Currently, we do not reflect mitigation through insurance or any other risk transfer mechanism in our AMA model.\n\n## AMA model calibration and review\n\nA key assumption when calibrating data-driven frequency and severity distributions is that historical losses form a reasonable proxy for future events. In line with regulatory expectations, the AMA methodology utilizes both historical internal losses and external  losses  suffered  by  the  broader  industry  for  model calibration.\n\nInitial model outputs driven by loss history are reviewed and adjusted to reflect fast-changing external developments, such as new  regulations,  geopolitical  change,  volatile  market  and economic  conditions,  and  internal  factors  (e.g.,  changes  in business strategy and control framework enhancements). The resulting baseline data-driven frequency and severity distributions are reviewed by subject matter experts and where necessary adjusted based on a review of qualitative information about the business environment and internal control factors, as well as expert judgment, with the aim of forecasting losses.\n\nOur model is reviewed regularly to maintain risk sensitivity and recalibrated at least annually. Any changes to regulatory capital as  a  result  of  a  recalibration  or  methodology  changes  are presented  to  FINMA  for  approval  prior  to  use  for  disclosure purposes.\n\n## AMA model governance\n\nThe Group and entity-specific AMA models are subject to an independent validation performed by Model Risk Management & Control  in  line  with  the  Group's  model  risk  management framework.\n\n## Expected transition of capital regime under Basel III capital regulations\n\nThe  AMA  is  expected  to  be  replaced  by  the  standardized measurement  approach  for  regulatory  capital  determination purposes in line with the relevant Basel Committee for Banking Supervision Basel III capital regulations. UBS is interacting closely with the relevant Swiss authorities to discuss the implementation details and related implementation timeline.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital planning and activities' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the development of risk-weighted assets\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in this section for more information about our approach to model confirmation procedures\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information",

We believe that our capital strength is a source of confidence for our stakeholders, contributes  to  our  sound  credit  ratings  and  is  one  of  the foundations of our success.\n\nThe BCBS announced the finalization of the Basel III framework in December 2017, and published the final rules on the minimum capital  requirements  for  market  risk  from  the  Fundamental Review  of  the  Trading  Book  (the  FRTB)  in  January  2019.  In response to COVID-19, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision, which acts as the BCBS's oversight body, endorsed the deferral of the implementation date by one year, to 1 January 2023. The accompanying transitional arrangements for the output floor were also extended by one year, to 1 January 2028. We expect the Swiss regulations to come into force in 2024 and we continue to make progress on our infrastructure design and operational governance ahead of the upcoming adoption of these  rules.  We  currently  estimate  that  the  revised  Basel III framework may lead to a further net increase in risk-weighted assets (RWA) of around USD 20 billion in 2024, before taking into account mitigating actions. The estimate includes credit risk and operational  risk  RWA  from  the  finalization  of  the  Basel III framework, as well as market risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) RWA from the FRTB, based on our current understanding of the relevant standards. It may change as a result of new or changed regulatory interpretations, particularly those regarding the treatment of historical operational losses, as well as the appropriate conservatism in model calibration, the implementation of Basel III standards into national law, changes in business growth, market conditions and other factors.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Our strategy' and 'Targets, aspirations and capital guidance' sections of this report for more information about our capital and resource guidelines\n- \u203a Refer to 'We may be unable to maintain our capital strength' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information about capital ratio-related risks\n\n## Capital planning and activities\n\nAudited  | We  manage  our  balance  sheet,  RWA,  leverage  ratio denominator (LRD) and TLAC ratio levels based on our regulatory requirements  and  within  our  internal  limits  and  targets.  Our strategic focus is on achieving an optimal attribution and use of financial resources between our business divisions and Group Functions, as well as between our legal entities, while remaining within the limits defined for the Group and allocated to the business divisions by the Board of Directors (the BoD). These resource allocations, in turn, affect business plans and earnings projections, which are reflected in our capital plans.\n\nThe  annual  strategic  planning  process  includes  a  capitalplanning component that is key in defining our capital targets. It is based on an attribution of Group RWA and LRD internal limits to the business divisions.\n\nLimits and targets are established at the Group and business division levels, and are approved by the BoD at least annually. In the target-setting process, we take into account the current and potential future TLAC requirements, our aggregate risk exposure in terms of capital-at-risk, the assessment by rating agencies, comparisons with peers and the effect of expected accounting policy changes. \uf070\n\nMonitoring is based on these internal limits and targets and provides indications if any changes are required. Any breach of limits in place triggers a series of required remediating actions.\n\nGroup Treasury plans for and monitors consolidated TLAC information on an ongoing basis, reflecting business and legal entity requirements, as well as regulatory developments in capital regulations.  In  addition,  capital  planning  and  monitoring  are performed at the legal entity level for our significant subsidiaries and sub-groups that are subject to prudential supervision and must meet capital and other supervisory requirements.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries' in this section for more information",

The Pillar 3 Report further includes information relating to our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups (UBS AG standalone,  UBS  Switzerland  AG  standalone,  UBS Europe  SE consolidated and UBS Americas Holding LLC consolidated) as of 31 December 2021 and is available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors .\n\nCapital and  other  regulatory  information  for  UBS AG consolidated  in  accordance  with  the  Basel III  framework,  as applicable to Swiss SRBs, is provided in the combined UBS Group AG and UBS AG Annual Report 2021, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors .\n\n## Regulatory framework\n\nThe  Basel III  framework  came  into  effect  in  Switzerland  on 1 January 2013 and is embedded in the Swiss Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO). The CAO also includes the too-big-to-fail provisions applicable to Swiss SRBs, which have been fully phasedin since 1 January 2020.\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB framework, going and gone concern requirements represent the Group's TLAC requirement. TLAC encompasses regulatory capital, such as CET1, loss-absorbing additional tier 1 (AT1) and tier 2 capital instruments, and liabilities that can be written down or converted into equity in case of resolution or for the purpose of restructuring measures.\n\n## Capital and other instruments contributing to our total loss-absorbing capacity\n\nIn addition to CET1 capital, the following instruments contribute to our loss-absorbing capacity:\n\n- -loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (high- and low-trigger);\n- -loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instruments (high- and low-trigger);\n- -non-Basel III-compliant tier 2 capital instruments; and\n- -TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments.\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB rules, going concern capital includes CET1 and  high-trigger  loss-absorbing  AT1  capital  instruments.  Our existing  outstanding  low-trigger  loss-absorbing  AT1  capital instruments  are  available  to  meet  the  going  concern  capital requirements until their first call date. As of their first call date, these  instruments  are  eligible  to  meet  the  gone  concern requirements.\n\nOutstanding high- and low-trigger loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instruments, non-Basel III-compliant tier 2 capital instruments and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments are eligible to meet gone concern requirements until one year before maturity. A maximum of 25% of the gone concern requirements can be met with instruments that have a remaining maturity of between one and two years (i.e., are in the last year of eligibility). However,\n\nonce at least 75% of the gone concern requirement has been met with instruments that have a remaining maturity of greater than two years, all instruments that have a remaining maturity of between one and two years remain eligible to be included in the total gone concern capital.\n\n- , for more information about the eligibility of capital and senior unsecured debt instruments and key features\n- \u203a Refer to 'Bondholder information,' available at ubs.com/investors and terms and conditions of capital instruments\n\nTotal loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratio requirements\n\n## Going concern capital requirements\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB requirements, total going concern minimum requirements for all Swiss SRBs are a capital ratio requirement of 12.86% of RWA and a leverage ratio requirement of 4.5%. In addition to these minimum requirements, an add-on reflecting the degree of systemic importance is applied, based on market share and LRD. The applicable market share add-on requirements for UBS increased 0.36% to 0.72% of RWA and 0.125% to 0.25% of LRD, reflecting an increase in UBS's market share in the Swiss credit business to more than 17%. The applicable LRD addon requirements remained unchanged at 0.72% of RWA and 0.25% of LRD, as our Group LRD remained within the same addon bucket.\n\nEffective  from  27 March  2020,  the  Swiss  Federal  Council deactivated the countercyclical buffer requirement of 2% on riskweighted  positions  that  are  directly  or  indirectly  backed  by residential  properties  in  Switzerland  to  support  the  lending capacity of banks. Even though the Swiss countercyclical buffer requirement was not active in 2021, we continued to apply additional countercyclical buffer requirements introduced in other BCBS member jurisdictions, which result in an additional buffer requirement of 0.02%. In January 2022, the Swiss Federal Council decided, at the request of the Swiss National Bank, to reactivate the countercyclical capital buffer, at a maximum level of 2.5%. The  reactivated  countercyclical  capital  buffer  will  become effective on 30 September 2022 and is expected to increase our CET1 capital requirement by approximately 30 basis points.\n\nThe total going concern capital requirements applicable are 14.32% of RWA (including countercyclical buffer requirements) and 5.00% of LRD. Furthermore, of the total going concern capital requirement of 14.32% of RWA, at least 10.02% must be met with CET1 capital, while a maximum of 4.3% can be met with high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (including  our  existing  outstanding  low-trigger  AT1  capital instruments, which qualify until their first call date as mentioned above).\n\nSimilarly, of the total going concern leverage ratio requirement of 5.00%, at least 3.5% must be met with CET1 capital, while a maximum of 1.5% can be met with high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (including our existing outstanding lowtrigger AT1 capital instruments, which qualify until their first call date as mentioned above).",

The gone concern requirements also include add-ons for market share and LRD.\n\nUnder the Swiss SRB framework, banks are eligible for a rebate on  the  gone  concern  requirement  if  they  take  actions  that facilitate recovery  and  resolvability  beyond  the  minimum requirements. The amount of the rebate for improved resolvability is  assessed  annually  by  FINMA.  Based  on  actions  we  had completed by December 2020 to improve resolvability, FINMA granted a rebate on the gone concern requirement of 55% of the aforementioned maximum rebate in the third quarter of 2021, which resulted in a reduction of 3.14 percentage points for the RWA-based  requirement  and  1.10 percentage  points  for  the LRD-based requirement.\n\nOur gone concern requirements are further reduced when higher  quality  capital  instruments  (CET1  capital,  low-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 or certain low-trigger tier 2 capital instruments) are used to meet gone concern requirements. As of\n\n31 December  2021,  UBS  used  low-trigger  tier 2 capital instruments to fulfill gone concern requirements, resulting in a reduction  of  0.43 percentage  points  for  the  RWA-based requirement  and  0.12 percentage  points  for  the  LRD-based requirement.\n\nUntil 31 December 2021, the gone concern requirement after the application of the rebate for resolvability measures and the reduction for the use of higher quality capital instruments was floored  at  8.6%  and  3%  for  the  RWA-  and  LRD-based requirements, respectively. From 1 January 2022 onward, this floor increased to 10% and 3.75% for the RWA- and LRD-based requirements, respectively.\n\nIn  this  report,  we  refer  to  the  RWA-based  gone  concern requirements

        "page_content": "## Total loss-absorbing capacity and movement\n\nOur total loss-absorbing capacity increased by USD 3.0 billion to USD 104.8 billion as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Going concern capital and movement\n\nAudited | Our CET1 capital mainly consists of: share capital; share premium, which primarily consists of additional paid-in capital related  to  shares  issued;  and  retained  earnings.  A  detailed reconciliation of IFRS equity to CET1 capital is provided in the 'Reconciliation of IFRS equity to Swiss SRB common equity tier 1 capital' table.\n\nOur CET1 capital increased by USD 5.4 billion to USD 45.3 billion as of 31 December 2021, mainly as a result of operating profit before tax of USD 9.5 billion, a USD 0.5 billion increase in eligible deferred tax assets on temporary differences, a USD 0.4 billion decrease in deduction of goodwill resulting from the sale of  our  remaining  minority  investment  in  Clearstream  Fund Centre AG (previously Fondcenter AG) and an increase of USD 0.2 billion related to the launch of our new operational partnership entity with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. These effects were partly offset by dividend accruals of USD 1.7 billion, current tax expenses of USD 1.6 billion, share repurchases under our share repurchase program of USD 0.6 billion, negative foreign currency  effects  of  USD 0.6  billion,  compensation-  and  own share-related capital components of USD 0.4 billion, and negative effects from defined benefit plans of USD 0.2 billion.\n\nOur share repurchases in 2021 decreased CET1 capital by USD 0.6 billion, reflecting shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs of USD 2.6 billion, partly offset by the use of the capital reserve for potential share repurchases of USD 2.0 billion. The capital reserve for potential share repurchases was fully utilized during 2021.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS shares' in this section for more information about our share repurchase programs\n\nOur loss-absorbing additional tier 1 (AT1) capital decreased by USD 1.1 billion to USD 15.2 billion, mainly due to two calls of USD 2.6 billion of AT1 capital instruments denominated in US dollars and foreign currency translation and interest rate risk hedge effects, partly offset by two issuances of USD 2.25 billion of AT1 capital instruments denominated in US dollars. \uf070\n\n## Gone concern loss-absorbing capacity and movement\n\nAudited | Our total gone concern loss-absorbing capacity decreased by USD 1.3 billion to USD 44.3 billion as of 31 December 2021 and included  USD 41.1  billion  of  TLAC-eligible  senior  unsecured debt. \uf070\n\nThe decrease was mainly due to four TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments denominated in US dollars, euro and Swiss francs that ceased to be eligible as they had less than one year to maturity, the call of a low-trigger tier 2 capital instrument denominated in euro, a low-trigger loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instrument denominated in US dollars that ceased to be eligible as it had less than one year to maturity, and the call of a TLACeligible senior unsecured debt instrument denominated in euro, as well as interest rate risk hedge, foreign currency translation and other effects. These decreases were partly offset by 16 issuances of TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments denominated in euro, US dollars, Swiss francs, pounds sterling and Australian dollars.\n\n## Loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratios\n\nOur CET1 capital ratio increased 1.2 percentage points to 15.0%, reflecting a USD 5.4 billion increase in CET1 capital that was partly offset by a USD 13.1 billion increase in RWA.\n\nOur CET1 leverage ratio increased 0.39 percentage points to 4.24% as of 31 December 2021, as the aforementioned increase in CET1 capital was partly offset by a USD 32 billion increase in LRD.\n\nOur  gone  concern  loss-absorbing  capacity  ratio  decreased from 15.8% to 14.6% and our gone concern leverage ratio decreased from 4.4% to 4.1%, mainly driven by an increase in RWA and LRD, respectively, and the aforementioned decrease in gone concern loss-absorbing capacity.",

in the Swiss pension fund. As announced in 2018, a similar contribution will be made in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to 'Note 29 Pension and other post-employment benefit plans' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of the Annual Report 2019 for more information.\n\n## Additional information\n\n## Active management of sensitivity to foreign exchange movements\n\nGroup Treasury is mandated to minimize adverse effects from changes in foreign currency rates on our CET1 capital and / or CET1 capital ratio. A significant portion of our CET1 capital and RWA is denominated in Swiss francs, euro, pounds sterling and other currencies. In order to hedge the CET1 capital ratio, CET1 capital  needs  to  have  foreign  currency  exposure,  leading  to foreign currency rates sensitivity of CET1 capital.\n\nAs a consequence, it is not possible to simultaneously fully hedge CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. As the proportion of RWA denominated in currencies other than the US dollar outweighs  CET1  capital  in  such  currencies,  a  significant appreciation of the US dollar against such currencies could benefit our capital ratios, while a significant depreciation of the US dollar against these currencies could adversely affect our capital ratios.\n\nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee (the Group ALCO), a committee of the Group Executive Board, has mandated Group Treasury to adjust the currency mix of CET1 capital, within limits\n\nset  by  the  BoD,  to  balance  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange movements on CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. Limits are in place for the sensitivity of both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US dollar against other currencies.\n\n## Sensitivity to currency movements\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nWe estimate that a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have increased our RWA by USD 13 billion and  our  CET1  capital  by  USD 1.4  billion  as  of 31 December  2021  (31 December  2020:  USD 13  billion  and USD 1.3 billion, respectively) and decreased our CET1 capital ratio 15 basis points (31 December 2020: 15 basis points).\n\nConversely, we estimate that a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have decreased our RWA by USD 11  billion  and  our  CET1  capital  by  USD 1.3  billion (31 December  2020:  USD 12  billion  and  USD 1.2  billion, respectively) and increased our CET1 capital ratio 14 basis points (31 December 2020: 15 basis points).",

        "page_content": "## Leverage ratio denominator\n\nOur  leverage  ratio  is  also  sensitive  to  foreign  exchange movements as a result of the currency mix of our capital and LRD. When adjusting the currency mix in capital, potential effects on the going concern leverage ratio are taken into account and the sensitivity of the going concern leverage ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US dollar against other currencies is actively monitored.\n\nWe estimate that a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have increased our LRD by USD 63 billion as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: USD 65 billion) and  decreased  our  Swiss  SRB  going  concern  leverage  ratio 15 basis points (31 December 2020: 16 basis points). Conversely, we estimate that a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have decreased our LRD by USD 57 billion (31 December 2020: USD 58 billion) and increased our Swiss SRB going concern leverage ratio 16 basis points (31 December 2020: 16 basis points).\n\nThe  aforementioned  sensitivities  do  not  consider  foreign currency translation effects related to defined benefit plans other than those related to the currency translation of the net equity of foreign operations.\n\n## Estimated effect on capital from litigation, regulatory and similar matters subject to provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nWe have estimated the loss in capital that we could incur as a result  of  the  risks  associated  with  the  matters  described  in 'Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report. We have  employed  for  this  purpose  the  advanced  measurement approach (AMA) methodology that we use when determining the capital requirements associated with operational risks, based on a 99.9%  confidence  level  over  a  12-month  horizon.  The methodology  takes  into  consideration  UBS  and  industry experience for the AMA operational risk categories to which those matters correspond, as well as the external environment affecting risks of these types, in isolation from other areas. On this basis, we estimate the maximum loss in capital that we could incur over a 12-month period as a result of our risks associated with these operational risk categories at USD 4.0 billion as of 31 December 2021, with no change to prior year-end. This estimate is not related  to  and  does  not  take  into  account  any  provisions recognized for any of these matters and does not constitute a subjective assessment of our actual exposure in any of these matters.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Non-financial risk' in the 'Risk management and\n- control' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities' in the\n- 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries\n\nUBS Group AG is a holding company conducting substantially all operations through UBS AG and subsidiaries thereof. UBS Group AG and UBS AG have contributed a significant portion of their respective  capital  to,  and  provided  substantial  liquidity  to, subsidiaries. Many of these subsidiaries are subject to regulations requiring compliance with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements. Regulatory capital components and capital ratios of our  significant  regulated  subsidiaries  determined  under  the regulatory framework of each subsidiary's home jurisdiction are provided in the 'Financial and regulatory key figures for our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups' section of this report. Supervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher  requirements,  or  to  otherwise  limit  the  activities  of subsidiaries. Supervisory authorities also may require entities to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis, and may limit the ability of the entity to engage in new activities or take capital actions based on the results of those tests.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more capital and other regulatory information about our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups\n\n## Joint liability of UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG\n\nIn June 2015, upon the transfer of the Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses booked in Switzerland from UBS AG to UBS Switzerland AG, UBS AG and UBS  Switzerland  AG  assumed  joint  liability  for  obligations transferred  to  UBS  Switzerland  AG  and  existing  at  UBS  AG, respectively. Under certain circumstances, the Swiss Banking Act and FINMA's Banking Insolvency Ordinance authorize FINMA to modify, extinguish or convert to common equity liabilities of a bank in connection with a resolution or insolvency of such bank.\n\nThe  joint  liability  amounts  have  declined  as  obligations matured, terminated or were novated following the transfer date. As of 31 December 2021, the liability of UBS Switzerland AG amounted to CHF 5.2 billion (the equivalent of USD 5.7 billion), a decrease  of  CHF 3.7  billion  (USD 4.4  billion)  compared  with 31 December 2020. The respective liability of UBS AG has been substantially extinguished.",

This increase was partly driven by asset size and other movements of USD 5.8 billion, due to an increase in asset size of USD 8.8 billion, mainly due to loan growth in Global Wealth Management, partly offset by asset quality movements of USD 3.1 billion, mainly reflecting\n\nimprovements in counterparty ratings and loss given default (LGD) in  Global  Wealth  Management  and  Personal  &  Corporate Banking. Also, 2021 included increases from model updates of USD 5.3  billion,  regulatory  add-ons  of  USD 3.1  billion,  and methodology  and  policy  changes  of  USD 2.0  billion.  These increases were partly offset by decreases from currency effects of USD 4.1 billion.\n\n## Movement in credit and counterparty credit risk RWA by key driver 1\n\n| USD billion                                                                                                               | Global Wealth Management   | Personal & Corporate Banking   | Asset Management   | Investment Bank   | Group  Functions   | G Grroouupp   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n| T Toottaall  ccrreeddiitt  aanndd  ccoouunntteerrppaarrttyy  ccrreeddiitt  rriisskk  RRWWAA  aass  ooff  3311..1122..2200 | 4 466..77                  | 6 622..88                      | 2 2..99            | 5 588..55         | 7 7..22            | 1 17788..11   |\n| Asset size                                                                                                                | 5.5                        | 1.1                            | 0.3                | 1.8               | 0.1                | 8 8..88       |\n| Asset quality                                                                                                             | (1.3)                      | (1.1)                          | 0.0                | (0.4)             | (0.3)              | ((33..11))    |\n| Model updates                                                                                                             | 4.3                        | 1.2                            | 0.0                | (0.2)             | 0.0                | 5 5..33       |\n| Methodology and policy changes                                                                                            | 1.7                        | 0.3                            | 0.0                | 0.0               | 0.0                | 2 2..00       |\n| Regulatory add-ons                                                                                                        | 0.2                        | 0.7                            | 0.0                | 2.3               | (0.1)              | 3 3..11       |\n| Acquisitions and disposals                                                                                                | 0.0                        | 0.0                            | 0.0                | 0.0               | 0.0                | 0 0..00       |\n| Foreign exchange movements                                                                                                | (0.6)                      | (1.6)                          | 0.0                | (1.4)             | (0.5)              | ((44..11))    |\n| Other                                                                                                                     | 0.4                        | (0.4)                          | 0.0                | 0.0               | 0.0                | 0 0..11       |\n| T Toottaall  mmoovveemmeenntt                                                                                             | 1 100..22                  | 0 0..22                        | 0 0..33            | 2 2..11           | ( (00..88))        | 1 122..00     |\n| T Toottaall  ccrreeddiitt  aanndd  ccoouunntteerrppaarrttyy  ccrreeddiitt  rriisskk  RRWWAA  aass  ooff  3311..1122..2211 | 5 566..99                  | 6 633..00                      | 3 3..22            | 6 600..55         | 6 6..44            | 1 19900..11   |\n\n- 1 1 Refer to the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors for the definitions of credit and counterparty credit risk RWA movement categories.",

        "page_content": "## Model updates\n\nThe increase in credit and counterparty credit risk RWA from model updates of USD 5.3 billion was primarily driven by the phase-in impacts for structured margin loans and similar products in Global Wealth Management of USD 2.1 billion and by new probability of default (PD) and LGD models for the mortgage portfolio  in  the  US  of  USD 2.0  billion.  In  addition,  we  have updated the LGD model for mortgages in Switzerland, which resulted in an RWA increase of USD 0.9 billion and was partly offset by an RWA reduction of USD 0.3 billion related to the introduction  of  new  models  for  the  leasing  of  aircraft  and industrial goods.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit risk models' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about model updates\n\n## Methodology changes\n\nThe increase in credit and counterparty credit risk RWA from methodology changes of USD 2.0 billion was primarily driven by a change related to credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk for derivative  exposures  with  Lombard  clients  that  resulted  in  an increase of USD 1.1 billion in RWA. Additionally, the approach used for the covered bonds within the high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) portfolio has been changed from the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach to the standardized approach, as requested by FINMA, resulting in an RWA increase of USD 1.0 billion.\n\n## Regulatory add-ons\n\nThe increase in credit and counterparty credit risk RWA from regulatory add-ons of USD 3.1 billion was primarily driven by addons for prime brokerage clients of USD 2.4 billion, credit card exposures in Switzerland of USD 0.5 billion, as well as clients leasing aircraft and industrial goods of USD 0.4 billion.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report and the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about credit and counterparty credit risk developments\n\nWe  expect  that  further  methodology  changes  and  model updates, as well as regulatory add-ons, will increase credit and counterparty credit risk RWA by around USD 10 billion in 2022. The extent and timing of RWA changes may vary as methodology changes and model updates are completed and receive regulatory approval. In addition, changes in the composition of the relevant portfolios and other market factors will affect RWA.",

This was partly offset by an increase from regulatory add-ons of USD 3.1 billion, primarily related to time decay. The integration of time decay into the  regulatory  VaR  model  is  subject  to  further  discussions between FINMA and UBS.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report and the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors, for more information about market risk developments\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk RWA increased by USD 1.0 billion to USD 76.7 billion as of 31 December 2021, driven by the annual recalibration of the AMA model used for the calculation of operational risk capital. Allocations to the business divisions changed in the fourth quarter of 2021, as certain historical losses dropped from the time window that is relevant for the internal allocation approach.\n\nWe are assessing the effect of the verdict in the French crossborder matter and the corresponding changes in provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters on operational risk RWA in  consultation  with  FINMA.  We  expect  to  reflect  additional operational risk RWA in the first quarter of 2022, with a potential single-digit  billion  US  dollar  operational  risk  RWA  impact following completion of this assessment.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Advanced measurement approach model' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about the AMA model\n\n## Risk-weighted assets

These exposures are presented separately under Derivative exposures and Securities financing transactions in this table.\n\nThe LRD movements described below exclude currency effects.\n\nOn-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivative exposures and  SFTs)  increased  by  USD 58  billion,  mainly  driven  by  an increase in central bank balances partly offset by disposal of highquality liquid asset (HQLA) securities in Group Treasury, as well as higher lending balances, mainly in Global Wealth Management, and trading assets in the Investment Bank.\n\nDerivative exposures decreased by USD 3 billion, reflecting market-driven movements and lower client volumes mainly in the Investment Bank.\n\nSFTs decreased by USD 4 billion, mainly due to lower prime brokerage receivables and margin loan repayments as a result of client activities in the Investment Bank.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet and off-balance sheet' in this section for more information about balance sheet movements",

Average RWA and LRD  are  converted  to  common  equity  tier 1  (CET1)  capital equivalents using capital ratios of 12.5% and 3.75%, respectively. If the attributed tangible equity calculated under the weighteddriver approach is less than the CET1 capital equivalent of riskbased capital (RBC) for any BD, the CET1 capital equivalent of RBC is used as a floor for that BD.\n\nIn addition to tangible equity, we allocate equity to the BDs to support goodwill and intangible assets.\n\nFurthermore, we allocate to the BDs attributed equity related to certain CET1 deduction items, such as compensation-related components  and  expected  losses  on  the  advanced  internal ratings-based portfolio less provisions.\n\nWe attribute all remaining Basel III capital deduction items to Group Functions. These items include deferred tax assets (DTAs) recognized  for  tax  loss  carry-forwards,  DTAs  on  temporary differences in excess of the threshold, accruals for shareholder returns, and unrealized gains from cash flow hedges.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet and off-balance sheet' in this section for more information about movements in equity attributable to shareholders\n\n## Average attributed equity\n\n|                                                                                                                                         | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD billion                                                                                                                             | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             | 31.12.19             |\n| Global Wealth Management                                                                                                                | 1 188..88            | 17.1                 | 16.6                 |\n| Personal & Corporate Banking                                                                                                            | 9 9..22              | 8.9                  | 8.4                  |\n| Asset Management                                                                                                                        | 2 2..00              | 2.0                  | 1.8                  |\n| Investment Bank                                                                                                                         | 1 133..00            | 12.6                 | 12.3                 |\n| Group Functions                                                                                                                         | 1 166..33            | 17.4                 | 15.1                 |\n| of which: deferred tax assets 1                                                                                                         | 5 5..99              | 6.7                  | 7.1                  |\n| of which: related to retained RWA and LRD 2,3                                                                                           | 3 3..22              | 3.4                  | 2.8                  |\n| of which: accruals for shareholder returns and others 4                                                                                 | 7 7..22              | 7.2                  | 5.1                  |\n| A Avveerraaggee  eeqquuiittyy  aattttrriibbuutteedd  ttoo  bbuussiinneessss  ddiivviissiioonnss  aanndd  GGrroouupp  FFuunnccttiioonnss | 5 599..33            | 57.8                 | 54.2                 |\n\n- 1 1 Includes average attributed equity related to the Basel III capital deduction items for deferred tax assets (deferred tax assets recognized for tax loss carry-forwards and deferred tax assets on temporary differences, excess over threshold), as well as retained RWA and LRD related to deferred tax assets. 2 2 Excludes average attributed equity related to retained RWA and LRD related to deferred tax assets. 3 3 The temporary exemption that applied from 25 March 2020 until 1 January 2021 and was granted by FINMA in connection with COVID-19 was not applied when calculating average attributed equity for 2020.

This section provides information  about  regulatory  requirements  and  the  firm's governance  structure, liquidity and  funding  management (including sources of liquidity and funding), contingency planning, and stress testing. The balances disclosed in this section represent year-end  positions,  unless  indicated  otherwise.  Intra-period balances fluctuate in the ordinary course of business and may differ from year-end positions.\n\n## Strategy, objectives and governance\n\nAudited | Our management of balance sheet, liquidity and funding positions has the overall objective of optimizing our franchise's value across a broad range of market conditions while considering current and future regulatory constraints. We employ a number of measures to monitor these positions under normal and stressed conditions.  In  particular,  we  use  stress  scenarios  to  apply behavioral adjustments to our balance sheet and calibrate the results  from  internal  stress  models  while  in  compliance  with external measures, primarily the liquidity coverage ratio (the LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (the NSFR). Our liquidity and funding strategy is proposed by Group Treasury and approved by the Group Asset and Liability Committee (the Group ALCO), which is a committee of the Group Executive Board (the GEB) that is overseen by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the BoD). \uf070\n\nGroup Treasury monitors and oversees the implementation and  execution  of  our  liquidity  and  funding  strategy  and  is responsible for adherence to policies, limits, triggers and targets. This  enables  close  control  of  both  our  cash  and  collateral, including  our  high-quality  liquid  assets,  and  centralizes  the Group's  general  access  to  wholesale  cash  markets  in  Group Treasury. In addition, should a crisis require contingency funding measures  to  be  invoked,  Group  Treasury  is  responsible  for coordinating  liquidity  generation  with  representatives  of  the relevant business areas. Group Treasury reports on the Group's overall liquidity and funding position, including funding status and concentration risks, at least monthly, to the Group ALCO and the Risk Committee of the BoD.\n\nAudited | Liquidity and funding limits, triggers and targets are set  at  Group  and,  where  appropriate,  at  legal  entity  and business division levels, and are reviewed and reconfirmed at least once a year by the BoD, the Group ALCO, the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Risk Officer, the Group Treasurer and the business divisions, taking into consideration current and projected business strategy and risk tolerance. The principles underlying our limit, trigger and target framework\n\nare designed to maximize and sustain the value of our business franchise and maintain an appropriate balance in the asset and liability structure. Structural limits, triggers and targets focus on the structure and composition of the balance sheet, with supplementary limits, triggers and targets designed to drive the  utilization,  diversification  and  allocation  of  funding resources. To complement and support this framework, Group Treasury monitors the markets for early warning indicators regarding the current liquidity situation. These indicators are used at the Group level to assess both the overall global and regional liquidity status for potential threats. Treasury Risk Control  provides  independent  oversight  over  liquidity  and funding risks. \uf070\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Corporate governance' and 'Risk management and control' sections of this report for more information\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nAudited | Our liquidity risk management aims to ensure that the firm has sufficient liquidity or access to funding sources to meet its liabilities when due, to meet prudential requirements and to survive  a  severe  three-month  idiosyncratic  and  market-wide liquidity stress event, allowing for discrete management actions instructed by the Group Treasurer in addition to monetizing the firm's liquidity reserves.\n\nOur liquid assets are managed using limits, triggers and targets to maintain an appropriate level of diversification (issuer, tenor and other risk characteristics) in response to any expected or unexpected  volatility  in  funding  availability  or  requirements caused  by  adverse  market,  operational  or  other  firm-specific events. The liquid asset portfolio size is managed dynamically, so as to operate at all times within the risk appetite of the BoD and relevant Group and subsidiary liquidity requirements. \uf070\n\n## Stress testing\n\nAudited | We perform stress testing to determine the optimal asset and liability structure that enables us to maintain an appropriately balanced liquidity and funding position under various scenarios. Liquidity crisis scenario analysis and contingency funding planning support the liquidity management process and aim to ensure that immediate  corrective  measures  to  absorb  potential  sudden liquidity shortfalls can be put into effect. \uf070\n\nWe model our liquidity exposures under two main potential scenarios: a structural market-wide scenario and a combined market and idiosyncratic scenario. We continuously refine the assumptions used to maintain a robust, actionable and tested contingency plan.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Risk measurement' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about stress testing",

        "page_content": "## Structural market-wide scenario\n\nAs a liquidity crisis could have a myriad of causes, the structural market-wide scenario encompasses potential stress effects across all markets, currencies and products, but it is typically not firmspecific. In addition to the loss of the ability to replace maturing wholesale funding, it assumes a gradual decline of otherwise stable client deposits and liquidity outflows corresponding to a one-notch  downgrade  in  our  long-term  credit  rating,  and  a corresponding downgrade in our short-term rating.\n\nWe use a cash capital metric that incorporates the structural market-wide scenario and measures the amount of long-term funding available to fund franchise and illiquid assets. Franchise assets consist of lending exposure to clients or assets to support franchise client activities. The illiquid assets cannot easily and readily be sold or exchanged for cash without a substantial loss in value within the scenario horizon. Long-term funding used as cash capital to support franchise and illiquid assets is composed of unsecured funding with a remaining time to maturity of at least one year, deposits that have a behavioral maturity of at least one year and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Combined market and idiosyncratic scenario\n\nThe combined scenario represents an extreme stress event that combines  a  firm-specific  crisis  with  market  disruption.  This scenario  assumes:  (i) substantial  outflows  of  otherwise  stable client deposits, mainly due on demand; (ii) inability to renew or replace  maturing  unsecured  wholesale  funding;  (iii) unusually large drawdowns on loan commitments; (iv) reduced capacity to generate  liquidity  from  trading  assets;  (v) liquidity  outflows corresponding to a three-notch downgrade in our long-term credit rating, and a corresponding downgrade in our short-term rating; (vi) triggering contractual obligations to unwind derivative positions  or  to  deliver  additional  collateral;  (vii) additional collateral requirements due to adverse movements in the market values of derivatives; and (viii) elevated liquidity requirements in support  of  continuous  payment  and  settlement  activity.  The combined scenario is run daily to project potential cash outflows under it and is assessed as part of ongoing risk management activities.\n\n## Contingency Funding Plan\n\nAudited | Our Group Contingency Funding Plan is an integral part of our global crisis management framework, which covers various types of crisis events. This Contingency Funding Plan contains an assessment of contingent funding sources and liquidity generative actions in a stressed environment, early warning indicators and metrics, and contingency procedures. Our funding diversification and global scope help to protect our liquidity position in the event of a crisis. We regularly assess and test all material known and expected cash flows, as well as the level and availability of highquality collateral that could be used to raise additional funding if required. Our contingent funding sources include our high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) portfolios, available and unutilized liquidity facilities at several major central banks, contingent reductions of liquid  trading  portfolio  assets,  and  other  available  business management actions. \uf070\n\n## Funding management\n\nAudited  | Group Treasury regularly monitors our funding status, including concentration risks, aiming to ensure that we maintain a well-balanced and diversified liability structure. Our funding management team looks to create the optimal asset and liability structure to finance our businesses reliably and cost-efficiently. Our funding activities are planned by analyzing the overall liquidity and funding profile of our balance sheet, taking into account the amount of stable funding that would be needed to support ongoing business activities through periods of difficult market conditions. \uf070\n\nThe funding strategy of UBS Group AG is set annually in the Funding Plan and is reviewed on a quarterly basis. The Funding Plan is developed by Group Treasury and approved by the Group ALCO. Group Treasury proposes, sets and oversees limits, triggers and  targets  for  funding  generation,  including  concentration limits, weighted average maturity limits and volume. Funding diversification is monitored continuously, with a focus on product type, single-counterparty exposure (as a percentage of the total), maturity  profile,  and  the  overall  contribution  of  a  particular funding source to the liability mix.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Balance sheet and off-balance sheet' in this section for more information about the development of our short-term and long-term debt during 2021\n\nGlobal  Wealth  Management  and  Personal  &  Corporate Banking provide significant, cost-efficient and stable sources of funding. These include core deposits and debt issued through the Swiss central mortgage institutions, which use a portion of our portfolio of Swiss residential mortgages as collateral to generate long-term funding. In addition, we have several short-, mediumand long-term funding programs under which we issue senior unsecured debt and structured notes, as well as short-term debt. These programs enable institutional and private investors who are active in the markets of Europe, the US and Asia Pacific to customize their investments in UBS's debt. Collectively, these broad product offerings and funding sources, together with the global  scope  of  our  business  activities,  support  our  funding stability.\n\n## Internal funding and funds transfer pricing\n\nWe use an integrated liquidity and funding framework to govern the liquidity management of all our branches and subsidiaries, and our major sources of liquidity are channeled through entities that  are  fully  consolidated.  Group  Treasury  meets  internal demands  for  funding  by  channeling  funds  from  entities generating surplus cash to those in need of financing, except in circumstances where transfer restrictions exist.\n\nFunding  costs  and  benefits  are  allocated  to  our  business divisions according to our liquidity and funding risk management framework. Our internal funds transfer pricing system, which is governed by Group Treasury, is designed to provide the proper liability structure to support the assets and planned activities of each business division.",

        "page_content": "## Credit ratings\n\nCredit ratings can affect the cost and availability of funding, especially funding from wholesale unsecured sources. Our credit ratings  can  also  influence  the  performance  of  some  of  our businesses and the levels of client and counterparty confidence. Rating  agencies  take  into  account  a  range  of  factors  when assessing  creditworthiness  and  setting  credit  ratings.  These include the company's strategy, its business position and franchise value, stability and quality of earnings, capital adequacy, risk profile and management, liquidity management, diversification of funding sources, asset quality, and corporate governance. Credit ratings reflect the opinions of the rating agencies and can change at any time.\n\nIn  evaluating  our  liquidity  and  funding  requirements,  we consider the potential effect of a reduction in our long-term credit ratings and a corresponding reduction in short-term ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, rating trigger clauses could result in an immediate cash settlement or the need to deliver additional collateral to counterparties from contractual obligations related to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative positions and  other  obligations.  Based  on  our  credit  ratings  as  of  31 December 2021, in the event of a one-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, we would have been required to provide USD 0.0 billion in cash or other collateral. In the event of a twonotch reduction it would have been USD 0.5 billion and for a three-notch downgrade USD 0.7 billion. In all scenarios these collateral requirements predominantly relate to OTC derivative positions.\n\nThere was one main rating action with regard to UBS Group AG's and UBS AG's solicited credit ratings in 2021. On 2 March 2021, Fitch Ratings revised the outlooks for the issuer ratings of UBS Group AG, UBS AG and the rated subsidiaries from negative back to stable, reversing the outlook change on 31 March 2020, which was part of a series of rating actions over several weeks across  the  sector  to  reflect  the  disruption  caused  by  the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Liquidity and funding management are critical to UBS's ongoing performance' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\nThe LCR measures the short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity profile by comparing whether sufficient HQLA are available to survive expected net cash outflows from a significant liquidity stress scenario, as defined by the relevant regulator.\n\nFor UBS, HQLA are low-risk unencumbered assets under the control  of  Group  Treasury  that  are  easily  and  immediately convertible into cash at little or no loss of value, in order to meet liquidity needs. Our HQLA predominantly consist of assets that qualify as Level 1 in the LCR framework, including cash, central bank reserves and government bonds. Group HQLA are held by UBS AG and its subsidiaries, and may include amounts that are available  to  meet  funding  and  collateral  needs  in  certain jurisdictions, but are not readily available for use by the Group as a  whole.  These  limitations  are  typically  the  result  of  local regulatory requirements, including local LCR and large exposure requirements. Funds that are effectively restricted are excluded from the calculation of Group HQLA to the extent they exceed the outflow assumptions for the subsidiary that holds the relevant HQLA. On this basis, USD 44 billion of assets were excluded from our daily average Group HQLA for the fourth quarter of 2021. Amounts held in excess of local liquidity requirements that are not subject to other restrictions are generally available for transfer within the Group.\n\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards require an LCR of at least 100%. In a period of financial stress, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) may allow banks to use their HQLA and let their LCR temporarily fall below  the  minimum  threshold.  We  monitor  the  LCR  in  all significant currencies in order to manage  any  currency mismatches between HQLA and the net expected cash outflows in times of stress.\n\nOur daily average LCR for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 155%, compared with 152% in the fourth quarter of 2020, remaining above the prudential requirement communicated by FINMA.\n\nThe average LCR increase was driven by a USD 14 billion increase in average HQLA to USD 228 billion, driven by higher average cash balances, which was partly offset by an increase in average net cash outflows of USD 6 billion to USD 147 billion, due to higher outflows from customer deposit balances and secured financing transactions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more information about the LCR\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Significant regulated subsidiary and sub-group information' section of this report for more information about the LCR of UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\n| USD billion, except where indicated                           |   A Avveerraaggee  44QQ2211 1 |   Average 4Q20 1 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| High-quality liquid assets                                    |                        222288 |              214 |\n| Net cash outflows                                             |                        114477 |              141 |\n| L Liiqquuiiddiittyy  ccoovveerraaggee  rraattiioo  ((%%)) 2 2 |                        115555 |              152 |\n\n1 1 Calculated based on an average of 66 data points in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 63 data points in the fourth quarter of 2020. 2 2 Calculated after the application of haircuts and inflow and outflow rates, as well as, where applicable, caps on Level 2 assets and cash inflows.",

        "page_content": "## Net stable funding ratio\n\nThe net stable funding ratio (NSFR) framework is intended to limit overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, to encourage a better assessment of funding risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items and to promote funding stability. The NSFR has two components: available stable funding (ASF) and required stable funding (RSF). ASF is the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be available over the period of one year. RSF is a measure of the stable funding requirement of an asset based on its maturity, encumbrance and other characteristics, as well as the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity from off-balance sheet exposures. The BCBS NSFR regulatory framework requires a ratio of at least 100%.\n\nThe NSFR regulation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the release of the revised FINMA Circular 2015/2 'Liquidity risks - banks' and became effective on 1 July 2021.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, our NSFR was unchanged at 119%.

Intra-period  balances fluctuate in the ordinary course of business and may differ from year-end positions.\n\n## Balance sheet assets\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, balance sheet assets totaled USD 1,117 billion, a decrease of USD 9 billion compared with 31 December 2020,  which  included  a  decrease  from  currency  effects  of approximately USD 21 billion.\n\nDerivatives  and  cash  collateral  receivables  on  derivative instruments decreased by USD 44  billion. This decrease predominantly reflected decreases in foreign exchange contracts, mainly in our Derivatives & Solutions and Financing businesses in the Investment Bank, driven by net roll-offs, partly offset by market-driven movements. In addition, interest rate contracts decreased, mainly in our Derivatives & Solutions and Financing businesses  and  in  Non-core  and  Legacy  Portfolio,  reflecting market-driven movements as long-term interest rates increased in the year.\n\nOther financial assets measured at amortized cost and fair value decreased by USD 21 billion, largely due to shifts within the high-quality liquid asset (HQLA) portfolio from securities into cash within Group Treasury. Brokerage receivables decreased by USD 3 billion, mainly in our Financing business in the Investment Bank,\n\n## Assets\n\n|                                                                                | As of             | As of    | % change from   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|\n| USD billion                                                                    | 3 311..1122..2211 | 31.12.20 | 31.12.20        |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                             | 119922..88        | 158.2    | 22              |\n| Lending 1                                                                      | 441133..22        | 395.0    | 5               |\n| Securities financing transactions at amortized cost                            | 7755..00          | 74.2     | 1               |\n| Trading portfolio 2                                                            | 113300..88        | 125.4    | 4               |\n| Derivatives and cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments          | 114488..77        | 192.4    | (23)            |\n| Brokerage receivables                                                          | 2211..88          | 24.7     | (11)            |\n| Other financial assets measured at amortized cost and fair value 3             | 7733..88          | 95.1     | (22)            |\n| Non-financial assets and financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts | 6611..00          | 60.9     | 0               |\n| T Toottaall  aasssseettss                                                      | 11,,111177..22    | 1,125.8  | (1)             |\n\n1 1 Consists of loans and advances to banks and customers. 2 2 Consists of financial assets at fair value held for trading. 3 3 Consists of financial assets at fair value not held for trading, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and other financial assets measured at amortized cost, but excludes financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts.\n\nwith growth in lending more than offset by an associated increase in netting effects.\n\nThese decreases were partly offset by a USD 35 billion increase in Cash and balances at central banks, predominantly in Group Treasury.  The  cash  inflow  was  generated  mainly  from  lower funding consumption by the Investment Bank, the aforementioned shifts within the HQLA portfolio from securities into  cash,  and  net  new  issuances  of  long-term  debt  issued measured at amortized cost. These inflows were partly offset by outflows from higher margin requirements and an increase in net receivables  from  securities  financing  transactions,  as  well  as currency effects.\n\nLending assets increased by USD 18 billion, of which USD 21 billion was in Global Wealth Management and predominantly reflected  increases  in  Lombard  loans  and  mortgage  loans, primarily in the Americas, partly offset by currency effects. In Personal & Corporate Banking, lending assets decreased by USD 1 billion as increases in mortgage loans and corporate lending were more than offset by currency effects. Trading portfolio assets increased by USD 5 billion, mainly in our Financing business in the Investment Bank, reflecting higher inventory held to hedge client positions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information",

Trading portfolio liabilities decreased by USD 2 billion, predominantly due to lower levels of short positions held to hedge client positions. Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and fair value decreased by USD 2 billion,  mainly  in  Group  Treasury  due  to  higher  netting  on securities financing transactions measured at fair value. Shortterm borrowings decreased by USD 2 billion, mainly due to lower short-term debt issued in Global Wealth Management, partly offset by higher amounts due to banks in our Derivatives & Solutions business in the Investment Bank.\n\nThese decreases were partly offset by an increase in customer deposits of USD 17 billion. An increase of USD 22 billion in Global Wealth Management, mainly in the Americas, was partly offset by a decrease of USD 4 billion in Personal & Corporate Banking driven by currency effects. As of 31 December 2021, our ratio of customer  deposits  to  outstanding  loan  balances  was  136% (31 December 2020: 138%).\n\nDebt issued designated at fair value and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 16 billion, mainly driven by USD 13 billion higher debt issued designated at fair value, mainly reflecting net new issuances of equity-linked and rates-linked debt instruments, as well as market-driven movements  in  our  Derivatives  &  Solutions  business  in  the Investment Bank. In addition, long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 3 billion, driven by net new issuances, partly offset by  foreign  exchange  and  hedge accounting effects. During 2021, net new issuances of TLACeligible  benchmark  instruments  and  senior  unsecured  debt USD 12  billion  were  partly  offset  by  USD 4  billion  of  net redemptions of covered bonds and subordinated debt instruments.\n\nDuring  2022,  USD 1.4  billion  equivalent  of  TLAC-eligible benchmark instruments and USD 2.0 billion of loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instruments will mature. In February 2022, lossabsorbing  additional  tier 1  capital  instruments  equivalent  to USD 1.1 billion were called and USD 2.8 billion equivalent of TLAC-eligible benchmark instruments matured. UBS is already compliant  with  its  2022  going  and  gone  concern  capital requirements and expects to act rationally and strategically with respect to the refinancing of any callable capital instruments and any potential incremental issuances.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the document titled 'UBS Group AG consolidated capital instruments and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt,' available under 'Bondholder information' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n\nBrokerage payables increased by USD 5 billion, mainly in the Financing business of our Investment Bank, due to an increase in client credit and short positions, partly offset by higher netting effects from increased lending.\n\nNon-financial liabilities and financial liabilities related to unitlinked investment contracts increased by USD 2 billion, mainly reflecting a reclassification of assets in Global Wealth Management as disposal groups held for sale in connection with the upcoming sales of our domestic wealth management business in Spain and UBS Swiss Financial Advisers AG. The increase also included  market-driven  increases  from  unit-linked  investment contracts in Asset Management.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity  attributable  to  shareholders  increased  by  USD 1,217 million to USD 60,662 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nThis increase was mainly driven by total comprehensive income attributable  to  shareholders  of  positive  USD 5,106  million, reflecting net profit of USD 7,457 million and negative other comprehensive income (OCI) of USD 2,351 million. OCI mainly included negative cash flow hedge OCI of USD 1,675 million, negative OCI related to foreign currency translation of USD 535 million and negative OCI related to debt instruments measured at fair value  through  OCI  of  USD 157  million.  In  addition, amortization  of  deferred  share-based  compensation  awards increased share premium by USD 643 million and the launch of our new operational partnership entity with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. resulted in an equity increase of USD 155 million.\n\nThese increases were partly offset by net treasury share activity that decreased equity by USD 3,326 million. This was mainly due to share repurchases with an acquisition cost of USD 2,500 million under  our  2021  share  repurchase  program,  repurchases  of USD 112 million under our 2018-2021 program and purchases of USD 545 million from the market to hedge our share delivery obligations  related  to  employee  share-based  compensation awards. In addition, distributions to shareholders reduced equity by USD 1,301 million, reflecting a dividend payment of USD 0.37 per share.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we canceled 156,632,400 shares  purchased  under  our  2018-2021  share  repurchase program,  as  approved  by  shareholders  at  the  2021  Annual General  Meeting.  The  cancellation  of  shares  resulted  in reclassifications within equity but had no net effect on our total equity attributable to shareholders.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Group performance' and 'Consolidated financial statements' sections of this report for more information about OCI\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS shares' in this section for more information about our share repurchase programs\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 30 Changes in organization and acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries and businesses' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about our partnership with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc.",

The residual contractual maturity of assets includes the effect of callable features. The residual contractual maturity of liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures is based on the earliest date on which we could be required to pay. The presentation of liabilities at the carrying amount in this table differs from 'Note 24 Maturity analysis of financial liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report, where such liabilities are  presented  on  an  undiscounted  basis,  as  required  by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nDerivative  financial  instruments  and  financial  assets  and liabilities at fair value held for trading are assigned to the Due within 1 month column , although one should note that the respective contractual maturities may extend over significantly longer periods.\n\nAssets  held  to  hedge  unit-linked  investment  contracts (presented within Financial assets at fair value not held for trading ) are assigned to the Due within 1 month column, consistent with the maturity assigned to the related amounts due under unitlinked  investment  contracts  (presented  within Other  financial liabilities designated at fair value ).\n\nOther  financial  assets  and  liabilities  with  no  contractual maturity, such as equity securities, are included in the Perpetual / Not applicable time bucket. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified  based  on  the  contractual  notice  period  that  the counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual contracts are included in the Perpetual / Not applicable time bucket.\n\nNon-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are generally included in the Perpetual / Not applicable time bucket.\n\nLoan commitments are classified on the basis of the earliest date they can be drawn down.\n\n## Maturity analysis of

These transactions  include  derivative  instruments,  guarantees,  loan commitments and similar arrangements.\n\nWhen we incur an obligation or become entitled to an asset through these arrangements, we recognize them on the balance sheet. It should be noted that in certain instances the amount recognized on the balance sheet does not represent the full gain or loss potential inherent in such arrangements.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1a Material accounting policies' items 1, 2a and 2c, and 'Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n\nThe following paragraphs provide more information about certain off-balance sheet arrangements. Additional off-balance sheet information is primarily provided in Notes 9, 10, 18, 20, 21i, 23 and 29 in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report, and in the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors.\n\n## Guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, we issue various forms of guarantees, commitments to extend credit, standby and other letters of  credit  to  support  our  clients,  forward  starting transactions, note issuance facilities and revolving underwriting facilities. With the exception of related premiums, generally these guarantees and similar obligations are kept as off-balance sheet items, unless a provision to cover probable losses or expected credit losses is required.\n\nGuarantees represent irrevocable assurances that, subject to the satisfying of certain conditions, we will make payments if our clients  fail  to  fulfill  their  obligations  to  third  parties.  As  of 31 December 2021, the net exposure (i.e., gross values less subparticipations)  from  guarantees  and  similar  instruments  was USD 19 billion, compared with USD 15 billion as of 31 December 2020. The increase of USD 4 billion reflected higher guarantees in Group Treasury and an increase in guarantees issued to corporate clients in Personal & Corporate Banking. Fee income from issuing guarantees was not significant to total revenues in 2021 or 2020.\n\nWe also enter into commitments to extend credit in the form of credit lines available to secure the liquidity needs of clients. The majority of loan commitments range in maturity from one month to one year. Committed unconditionally revocable credit lines are generally open-ended.\n\nDuring 2021, loan commitments decreased by USD 2 billion, mainly  in  Personal  &  Corporate  Banking,  predominantly  in Personal Banking Switzerland.\n\nCommitted  unconditionally  revocable  credit  lines  remained broadly stable. Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements decreased  by  USD 2  billion  and  forward  starting  repurchase agreements increased by USD 1 billion, both predominantly in Group Treasury.\n\n## Off-balance sheet\n\n|                                                  | As of             | As of    | % change from   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|\n| USD billion                                      | 3 311..1122..2211 | 31.12.20 | 31.12.20        |\n| Guarantees 1                                     | 1188..99          | 15.0     | 26              |\n| Loan commitments 1,2                             | 3399..55          | 41.4     | (5)             |\n| Committed unconditionally revocable credit lines | 4400..88          | 40.1     | 2               |\n| Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements 2 | 11..44            | 3.2      | (56)            |\n| Forward starting repurchase agreements 2         | 11..00            | 0.4      | 178             |\n\n- 1 1 Guarantees and Loan commitments are shown net of sub-participations. 2 2 The exposures related to loan commitments, forward starting repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements measured at fair value through profit or loss are not included in this table but are reflected as notional amounts in 'Note 10 Derivative instruments' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report.\n\nIf  customers  fail  to  meet  their  obligations,  our  maximum exposure  to  credit  risk  is  the  contractual  amount  of  these instruments. The risk is similar to the risk involved in extending loan facilities and is subject to the same risk management and control framework. In 2021, we recognized net credit loss releases of USD 46 million related to loan commitments, guarantees and other  credit  facilities  in  the  scope  of  expected  credit  loss measurement,  compared  with  net  credit  loss  expenses  of USD 138 million in 2020. Provisions recognized for guarantees,\n\nloan commitments and other credit facilities in the scope of expected credit loss measurement were USD 196 million as of 31 December  2021,  compared  with  USD 257  million  as  of 31 December 2020.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 9 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement' and 'Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about provisions for expected credit losses",

        "page_content": "For certain obligations we enter into partial sub-participations to mitigate various risks from guarantees and loan commitments. A sub-participation is an agreement by another party to take a share of the loss in the event that the obligation is not fulfilled by the obligor and, where applicable, to fund a part of the credit facility. We retain the contractual relationship with the obligor, and the sub-participant has only an indirect relationship. We only enter into sub-participation agreements with banks to which we ascribe a credit rating equal to or better than that of the obligor.\n\nWe also provide representations, warranties and indemnifications to third parties in the normal course of business.\n\n## Support provided to non-consolidated investment funds\n\nIn 2021, the Group did not provide material support, financial or otherwise, to unconsolidated investment funds when the Group was not contractually obligated to do so, nor does it have an intention to do so.\n\n## Clearing house and exchange memberships\n\nWe  are  a  member  of  numerous  securities  and  derivative exchanges and clearing houses. In connection with some of these memberships, we may be required to pay a share of the financial obligations of another member who defaults, or we may be otherwise exposed to additional financial obligations. While the membership rules vary, obligations generally would arise only if the exchange or clearing house had exhausted its resources. We consider the probability of a material loss due to such obligations to be remote.\n\n## Deposit insurance\n\nSwiss banking law and the deposit insurance system require Swiss banks and securities dealers to jointly guarantee an amount of up to CHF 6 billion for privileged client deposits in the event that a Swiss  bank  or  securities  dealer  becomes  insolvent.  As  of 31 December 2021, FINMA estimates our share in the deposit insurance  system  to  be  CHF 0.9  billion.  This  represents  a contingent payment obligation and exposes us to additional risk. As of 31 December 2021, we considered the probability of a material loss from our obligations to be remote.\n\nUBS  is  also  subject  to,  or  is  a  member  of,  other  deposit protection schemes in other countries. However, no contingent payment obligation existed as of 31 December 2021 from any other material scheme.\n\n## Material cash requirements\n\nThe Group's material cash requirements as of 31 December 2021 are represented by the residual contractual maturities for nonderivative and non-trading financial liabilities included in the table presented in 'Note 24 Maturity analysis of financial liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report. Included in the table are debt issued designated at fair value (USD 82 billion) and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost (USD 106 billion). The amounts represent estimated future interest and principal payments on an undiscounted basis.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we also issue or enter into various forms of guarantees, loan commitments and other similar arrangements that may result in an outflow of cash in the future. The maturity profile of these obligations, which are presented offbalance sheet, are included in 'Note 24 Maturity analysis of financial liabilities' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements' in this section for more information",

        "page_content": "## Cash flows\n\nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and often may bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that a traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful when evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity,  funding  and  capital  management  frameworks  and measures described elsewhere in this section.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled USD 207.9 billion, an increase of USD 34.3 billion compared with 31 December 2020, driven by net cash inflows from operating and financing activities. These effects were partly offset by net cash outflows from investing activities, as well as the effects of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents, mainly reflecting the appreciation of the US dollar against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and euro in 2021.\n\n## Operating activities\n\nNet cash inflows from operating activities were USD 31.4 billion in  2021,  compared  with  USD  37.0  billion  in  2020.  The  net operating cash flow, before changes in operating assets and liabilities and income taxes paid, was an inflow of USD 13.5 billion. Changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in net cash inflows of USD 18.0 billion, mainly driven by net inflows of\n\nUSD 29.8  billion  related  to  customer  deposits  and  USD 19.6 billion from financial assets and liabilities at fair value not held for trading and other financial assets and liabilities, as well as USD 8.1 billion from brokerage receivables and payables. These inflows were partly offset by a net outflow from lending balances to customers of USD 27.5 billion and a net outflow from financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading and derivative financial instruments of USD 10.5 billion.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nInvesting activities resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 2.1 billion in 2021, compared with USD 6.8 billion in 2020, primarily related to a cash outflow of USD 1.8 billion from purchase of property, equipment and software.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nFinancing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of USD 10.3 billion in 2021, compared with USD 12.4 billion in 2020, mainly due to net issuance proceeds of USD 18.4 billion from debt designated at fair value and long-term debt measured at amortized cost. This inflow was partly offset by the net repayment of USD 3.1 billion of short-term  debt,  net  cash  used  to  acquire  treasury  shares  of USD 3.3  billion  and  a  dividend  distribution  to  shareholders  of USD 1.3 billion.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Primary financial statements and share information' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information about cash flows\n\n## Statement of cash flows (condensed)\n\n|                                                                                                               | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD billion                                                                                                   | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             |\n| Net cash flow from / (used in) operating activities                                                           | 3 311                | 37                   |\n| Net cash flow from / (used in) investing activities                                                           | ( (22))              | (7)                  |\n| Net cash flow from / (used in) financing activities                                                           | 1 100                | 12                   |\n| Effects of exchange rate differences on cash and cash equivalents                                             | ( (55))              | 11                   |\n| N Neett  iinnccrreeaassee  //  ((ddeeccrreeaassee))  iinn  ccaasshh  aanndd  ccaasshh  eeqquuiivvaalleennttss | 3 344                | 54                   |\n| C Caasshh  aanndd  ccaasshh  eeqquuiivvaalleennttss  aatt  tthhee  eenndd  ooff  tthhee  yyeeaarr             | 2 20088              | 174                  |",

        "page_content": "## Currency management\n\n## Strategy, objectives and governance\n\nGroup Treasury focuses on three main areas of currency risk management: (i) currency-matched funding and investment of non-US  dollar  assets  and  liabilities;  (ii) sell-down  of  foreign currency IFRS profits and losses; and (iii) selective hedging of anticipated non-US dollar profits and losses to further mitigate the effect  of  structural  imbalances  in  the  balance  sheet.  Group Treasury also manages structural currency composition at the consolidated Group level.\n\n## Currency-matched funding and investment of non-US dollar assets and liabilities\n\nFor monetary balance sheet items and other investments, as far as is practical and efficient, we follow the principle of matching the currencies of our assets and liabilities for funding purposes. This avoids profits and losses arising from the translation of non-US dollar assets and liabilities.\n\nNet investment hedge accounting is applied to non-US dollar core  investments  to  balance  the  effect  of  foreign  exchange movements on both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 1a Material accounting policies' and 'Note 26 Hedge accounting' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital management' in this section for more information about our active management of sensitivity to currency movements and the effect thereof on our key ratios\n\n## Sell-down of non-US dollar reported profits and losses\n\nIncome statement items of foreign subsidiaries and branches of UBS AG with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average exchange rates. To reduce earnings volatility on the translation of previously recognized earnings in foreign currencies, Group Treasury centralizes the profits and losses (under IFRS) arising in UBS AG and its branches and sells or buys the profit or loss for US dollars on a monthly basis. Our foreign subsidiaries follow a similar monthly sell-down process into their own functional currencies. Retained earnings in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the US dollar are integrated and managed as part of our net investment hedge accounting program.\n\n## Hedging of anticipated non-US dollar profits and losses\n\nThe Group ALCO may at any time instruct Group Treasury to execute hedges to protect anticipated future profits and losses in foreign  currencies  against  possible  adverse  trends  of  foreign exchange rates. Although intended to hedge future earnings, these transactions are accounted for as open currency positions and subject to internal market risk limits for value-at-risk and stress loss limits.\n\n## Dividend distribution\n\nUBS Group AG declares dividends in US dollars. Shareholders holding shares through SIX (ISIN: CH0244767585) will receive dividends in Swiss francs, based on a published exchange rate calculated up to five decimal places, on the day prior to the exdividend  date.  Shareholders  holding  shares  through  DTC (ISIN: CH0244767585; CUSIP: H42097107) will be paid dividends in US dollars.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Standalone financial statements' section of this report for more information about the proposed dividend distribution of UBS Group AG",

UBS has an active share repurchase program to buy back up to CHF 4 billion of its own shares over the three-year period started in February 2021. The share repurchase information in this table is disclosed in Swiss francs as the share buybacks were transacted in Swiss francs on a separate trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange. 2 2 This table excludes purchases for the purpose of hedging derivatives linked to UBS Group AG shares and for market-making in UBS Group AG shares. The table also excludes UBS Group AG shares purchased by post-employment benefit funds for UBS employees, which are managed by a board of UBS management and employee representatives in accordance with Swiss law. UBS's post-employment benefit funds purchased 906,951 UBS Group AG shares during the year and held 14,073,132 UBS Group AG shares as of 31 December 2021. 3 3 Based on the transaction date of the respective treasury share purchases. 4 4 The remaining volume of the 2021 share repurchase program as of 31 December 2021 was USD 1,871 million.

        "page_content": "## Listing of UBS Group AG shares\n\nUBS Group AG shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). They are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) as global registered shares. As such, they can be traded and transferred  across  applicable  borders,  without  the  need  for conversion,  with  identical  shares  traded  on  different  stock exchanges in different currencies.\n\nDuring 2021, the average daily trading volume of UBS Group AG shares was 9.9 million shares on SIX and 0.5 million shares on the  NYSE.  SIX  is  expected  to  remain  the  main  venue  for determining the movement in our share price, because of the high volume traded on this exchange.\n\n## Ticker symbols UBS Group AG\n\n| T Trraaddiinngg  eexxcchhaannggee   | S SIIXX  //  NNYYSSEE   | B Blloooommbbeerrgg   | R Reeuutteerrss   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| SIX Swiss Exchange                  | UBSG                    | UBSG SW               | UBSG.S            |\n| New York Stock Exchange             | UBS                     | UBS UN                | UBS.N             |\n\nDuring  the  hours  in  which  both  SIX  and  the  NYSE  are simultaneously open for trading (generally 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central  European  Time),  price  differences  between  these exchanges  are  likely  to  be  arbitraged  away  by  professional market-makers.  Accordingly,  the  share  price  will  typically  be similar  between  the  two  exchanges  when  considering  the prevailing US dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate. When SIX is closed for trading, globally traded volumes will typically be lower. However, the specialist firm making a market in UBS Group AG shares on the NYSE is required to facilitate sufficient liquidity and maintain an orderly market in UBS Group AG shares throughout normal NYSE trading hours.\n\n## Security identification codes\n\n| ISIN    | C CHH00224444776677558855         |\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\n| Valoren | 2 244  447766  775588             |\n| CUSIP   | C CIINNSS  HH4422009977  1100  77 |",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nUBS Group AG is subject to, and complies with, all relevant Swiss legal and regulatory requirements regarding corporate governance,  including  the  SIX  Swiss  Exchange's  Directive  on Information relating to Corporate Governance (the SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance Directive) and the standards established in the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance, including the appendix on executive compensation.\n\nAs a foreign company with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange  (the  NYSE),  UBS  Group  AG  also  complies  with  all relevant corporate governance standards applicable to foreign private issuers.\n\nThe Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, adopted by the Board of Directors (the BoD) based on Art. 716b of the Swiss Code of Obligations and articles 25 and 27 of the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG, constitute our primary corporate governance guidelines.\n\nTo the extent practicable, the governance structures of UBS Group AG and UBS AG are aligned. UBS AG complies with all relevant  Swiss  legal  and  regulatory  corporate  governance requirements. As a foreign private issuer with debt securities listed on the NYSE, UBS AG also complies with the relevant NYSE corporate governance standards. The discussion in this section refers to both UBS Group AG and UBS AG, unless specifically noted otherwise or unless the information discussed is relevant only  to  listed  companies  and  therefore  only  applicable  to UBS Group AG. This approach is in line with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations and NYSE standards.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG and of UBS AG, and to the Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, available at ubs.com/governance and ubs.com/ubs-aggovernance, for more information\n- \u203a The SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance Directive is available at ser-ag.com/dam/downloads/regulation/listing/ directives/DCG-en.pdf, the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance at economiesuisse.ch/en/publications/ swiss-code-best-practice-corporate-governance and the NYSE rules at nyse.wolterskluwer.cloud/listed-company-manual\n\n## Differences from corporate governance standards relevant to US-listed companies\n\nThe  NYSE  standards  on  corporate  governance  require  foreign private  issuers  to  disclose  any  significant  ways  in  which  their corporate governance practices differ from those that have to be followed by domestic companies. Such differences are discussed below.\n\n## Responsibility of the Audit Committee regarding independent auditors\n\nOur  Audit  Committee  is  responsible  for  the  compensation, retention and oversight of independent auditors. It assesses the performance and qualifications of external auditors and submits proposals  for  appointment,  reappointment  or  removal  of independent auditors to the BoD. As required by the Swiss Code\n\nof Obligations, the BoD submits its proposals for a shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting (the AGM). Under NYSE standards  audit  committees  are  responsible  for  appointing independent auditors.\n\n## Discussion of risk assessment and risk management policies by the Risk Committee\n\nAs  per  the  Organization  Regulations  of  UBS  Group  AG  and UBS AG, the Risk Committee, instead of the Audit Committee, as per NYSE standards, oversees our risk principles and risk capacity on behalf of the BoD. The Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring our adherence to those risk principles and monitoring whether business divisions and control units maintain appropriate systems of risk management and control.\n\n## Supervision of the internal audit function\n\nAlthough under NYSE standards only audit committees supervise internal audit functions, the Chairman of the BoD (the Chairman) and the Audit Committee share the supervisory responsibility and authority with respect to the internal audit function.\n\n## Responsibility of the Compensation Committee for performance evaluations of senior management of UBS Group AG\n\nIn line with Swiss law, our Compensation Committee, together with the BoD, proposes for shareholder approval at the AGM the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the BoD, the maximum  aggregate  amount  of  fixed  compensation  for  the Group Executive Board (the GEB) and the aggregate amount of variable  compensation  for  the  GEB.  The  members  of  the Compensation Committee are elected by the AGM. Under NYSE standards it is the responsibility of compensation committees to evaluate senior management's performance and to determine and  approve,  as  a  committee  or  together  with  the  other independent directors, the compensation thereof.\n\n## Proxy statement reports of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee\n\nNYSE  standards  require  the  aforementioned  committees  to submit their reports directly to shareholders. However, under Swiss law all reports to shareholders, including those from the aforementioned committees, are provided to and approved by the BoD, which has ultimate responsibility to the shareholders.\n\n## Shareholder votes on equity compensation plans\n\nNYSE standards require shareholder approval for the establishing of  and  material  revisions  to  all  equity  compensation  plans. However, as per Swiss law, the BoD approves compensation plans. Shareholder approval is only mandatory if equity-based compensation plans require an increase in capital. No shareholder approval is required if shares for such plans are purchased in the market.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Board of Directors' in this section for more information about the BoD's committees\n- \u203a Refer to 'Share capital structure' in this section for more information about UBS Group AG's capital",

total share capital of UBS Group AG. At the same time, UBS had acquisition positions relating to 327,114,543 voting rights of UBS Group AG and disposal positions relating to 184,989,149 such rights, corresponding to 8.84% and 5.00% of the total voting rights of UBS Group AG, respectively. Of the disposal positions, 174,354,474 related to voting rights on shares deliverable in respect of employee awards. The calculation methodology for the acquisition and disposal positions is based on the Ordinance of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading, which states that all future potential share delivery obligations, irrespective of the contingent nature of the delivery, must be considered.\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nEmployee share ownership is encouraged and made possible in a variety of ways. Our Equity Plus Plan is a voluntary plan that provides eligible employees with the opportunity to purchase UBS Group AG shares at market value and receive, at no additional cost, one notional UBS Group AG share for every three shares purchased. The Equity Ownership Plan (the EOP) is a mandatory deferral plan for all employees with regulatory-driven deferral requirements or total compensation  greater  than  USD / CHF 300,000, excluding selected senior leaders. EOP recipients receive a portion of their deferred performance award in notional shares (and / or notional funds for Asset Management). Selected senior leaders receive the equity-based Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) instead of the EOP. Both the EOP and LTIP include provisions  that  allow  the  firm  to  reduce  or  fully  forfeit  the unvested deferred portion of an award if an employee commits certain harmful acts, and in most cases trigger forfeiture where employment has been terminated. To reinforce our emphasis on sustainable performance and risk management, and our focus on\n\nachieving growth ambitions, EOP and LTIP awards granted to certain employees will only vest if predetermined performance conditions are met.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, UBS employees held at least 7% of UBS shares outstanding (including approximately 5% in unvested notional shares from our compensation programs). These figures are based on known shareholding information from employee participation  plans,  personal  holdings  with  UBS  and  selected individual retirement plans. At the end of 2021, at least 30% of all employees held UBS shares through the firm's employee share participation plans.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Compensation' section on page 222 of this report for more information\n\n## Trading restrictions in UBS shares\n\nUBS employees with regular access to unpublished price-sensitive information about the firm are subject to specific restrictions in respect to UBS financial instruments, including, but not limited to, pre-clearance requirements and regular blackout periods. Such UBS  employees  are  not  permitted  to  trade  UBS  financial instruments in the period starting from the close of business in New York on the seventh business day of the final month of the financial quarter of UBS Group AG and ending on the day of the publication of the quarterly financial results.\n\n## Shares and participation certificates\n\nUBS Group AG has a single class of shares, which are registered shares in the form of uncertificated securities (in the sense of the Swiss Code of Obligations) and intermediary-held securities (in the sense of the Swiss Federal Act on Intermediated Securities).

As such, they can be traded and transferred across applicable borders, without the need for conversion, with identical shares traded on different stock exchanges in different currencies.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS shares' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section on page 178 of this report for more information\n\n## Distributions to shareholders\n\nThe decision to pay a dividend and the amount of any dividend depend on a variety of factors, including our profits, cash flow generation and capital ratios.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, the BoD intends to propose to shareholders for approval a dividend of USD 0.50 per share for the 2021 financial year. Shareholders whose shares are held through SIX SIS AG will receive dividends in Swiss francs, based on a public exchange  rate  on  the  day  prior  to  the  ex-dividend  date. Shareholders  holding  shares  through  The  Depository  Trust Company in New York and Computershare will be paid dividends in US dollars.\n\nIn compliance with Swiss tax law, 50% of the dividend will be paid out of retained earnings and the balance will be paid out of the capital contribution reserve. Dividends paid out of capital contribution reserves are not subject to Swiss withholding tax. The portion of the dividend paid out of retained earnings will be subject to a 35% Swiss withholding tax. For US federal income tax purposes, we expect that the dividend will be paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits.\n\nProvided  that  the  proposed  dividend  distribution  out  of retained earnings and out of the capital contribution reserve will\n\nbe  approved  at  the  AGM  on  6 April  2022,  the  payment  of USD 0.50 per share will be made on 14 April 2022 to holders of shares on the record date 13 April 2022. The shares will be traded ex-dividend as of 12 April 2022 and, accordingly, the last day on which the shares may be traded with entitlement to receive the dividend will be 11 April 2022.\n\nIn February 2021, the BoD launched a new three-year share buyback program. At the 2021 AGM, the shareholders authorized the BoD to buy back shares for cancellation purposes in an aggregate value of up to CHF 4 billion until the 2024 AGM. Any shares  bought  back  under  the  program  are  intended  to  be canceled by way of capital reduction, which will be subject to shareholder approval at one or several subsequent AGMs, and the acquisition and holding of such shares are not subject to the 10% threshold for UBS Group AG's own shares within the meaning of Art. 659 para. 1 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Since the start of this 2021 share repurchase program in February 2021 until 18 February 2022, we have bought back CHF 2.78 billion of shares. These shares are expected to be canceled by means of a capital reduction, to be proposed for shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM.\n\nLooking ahead, we intend to commence a new 2022 share buyback  program  of  up  to  USD 6  billion over two  years  and expect to execute up to USD 5 billion of share repurchases under both the existing 2021 and the new 2022 share buyback program by the end of 2022.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'UBS shares' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section on page 178 of this report for more information about the share repurchase programs",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders' participation rights\n\nWe  are  committed  to  shareholder  participation  in  decisionmaking processes. Our online voting platform offers registered shareholders  a  convenient  log-in  and  online  voting  process. Registered  shareholders  are  sent  personal  invitations  to  the general meetings. Together with the invitation materials, they receive a personal one-time password and a QR code to easily log in to the online voting platform, where they can enter their voting instructions or order an admission card for the general meeting.\n\nShareholders who choose not to receive the comprehensive invitation materials are informed of upcoming general meetings by a short letter containing a personal one-time password, a QR code for online voting and a reference to ubs.com/agm , where all information for the upcoming meeting is available.\n\nGeneral meetings offer shareholders the opportunity to raise questions for the BoD, GEB and internal and external auditors. Also,  prior  to  our  virtual  general  meetings,  we  offer  all shareholders the opportunity to contact us with questions, which are answered in writing or during the general meeting.\n\n## Voting rights, restrictions and representation\n\nWe place no restrictions on share ownership and voting rights. However, pursuant to general principles formulated by the BoD, nominee companies, which normally represent a large number of individual shareholders and may hold an unlimited number of shares, have voting rights limited to a maximum of 5% of all issued UBS Group AG shares. This is to avoid large shareholders being entered in UBS's share register via nominee companies so as to exercise influence without directly registering their shares with  UBS.  Securities  clearing  organizations,  such  as  The Depository Trust Company in New York, are not subject to this 5% voting limit.\n\nShareholders can exercise voting rights conferred by shares only if they are registered in our share register with voting rights. To register, shareholders must confirm that they have acquired UBS Group AG shares in their own name and for their own account. Nominee companies are required to sign an agreement confirming  their  willingness  to  disclose,  upon  our  request, individual beneficial owners holding more than 0.3% of all issued UBS Group AG shares.\n\nAll shareholders registered with voting rights are entitled to participate in general meetings. If they do not wish to attend in person, they may issue instructions to support, reject or abstain for each individual item on the meeting agenda, either by giving\n\ninstructions to an independent proxy in accordance with article 14 of the Articles of Association (the AoA) or by appointing another registered shareholder of their choice to vote on their behalf.  Alternatively,  registered  shareholders  may  issue  their voting  instructions  to  the  independent  proxy  electronically through our online voting platform. Nominee companies normally submit the proxy material to the beneficial owners and forward the collected votes to the independent proxy.\n\nIn 2021, physical attendance at the AGM was not possible, due to COVID-19-related restrictions in Switzerland, and voting rights could only be exercised through the independent proxy. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the BoD has decided to also hold the 2022 AGM without the physical participation of shareholders.\n\n- \u203a Refer to article 14 of the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG, available at ubs.com/governance , for more information about the issuing of instructions to independent voting right representatives\n\n## Statutory quorums\n\nMotions are decided at a general meeting by an absolute majority of the votes cast, excluding blank and invalid ballots. For the approval of certain specific issues, the Swiss Code of Obligations requires a positive vote from a two-thirds majority of the votes represented at the given general meeting, and from an absolute majority of the nominal value of shares represented thereat. Such issues  include  creating  shares  with  privileged  voting  rights, introducing restrictions on the transferability of registered shares, conditional and authorized capital increases and restricting or excluding shareholders' preemptive rights.\n\nThe  AoA  also  require  a  two-thirds  majority  of  votes represented  for  approval  of  any  change  to  their  provisions regarding the number of BoD members, any decision to remove one-quarter or more of the BoD members and any modification to the provision establishing this qualified quorum.\n\nVotes and elections are generally conducted electronically to ascertain the exact number of votes cast. Voting by a show of hands is possible if a clear majority is predictable. Shareholders representing at least 3% of the votes represented may request that a vote or election be carried out electronically or by written ballot. To allow shareholders to clearly express their views on all individual topics, each agenda item is separately put to a vote and BoD members are elected on a person-by-person basis.",

        "page_content": "## Convocation of general meetings of shareholders\n\nThe AGM must be held within six months of the close of the financial year (i.e., 31 December). In 2022, the AGM will take place on 6 April.\n\nExtraordinary  General  Meetings  (EGMs)  may  be  convened whenever  the  BoD  or  the  auditors  consider  it  necessary. Shareholders individually or jointly representing at least 10% of the share capital may at any time, including during an AGM, require, by way of a written statement, that an EGM be convened to address a specific issue they put forward.\n\nA personal invitation, including a detailed agenda, is made available to every registered shareholder at least 20 days ahead of each scheduled general meeting. The items on the agenda are also published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, as well as at ubs.com/agm.\n\n## Placing of items on the agenda\n\nPursuant  to  our  AoA,  shareholders  individually  or  jointly representing shares with an aggregate minimum nominal value of CHF 62,500 may submit proposals for matters to be placed on the agenda  for  consideration  at  the  next  general  meeting  of shareholders.\n\nAt the beginning of January, the invitation to submit such proposals is published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce and at ubs.com/agm. Requests for items to be placed on the agenda must include the actual motions to be put forward, together  with  a  short  explanation.  Such  requests  must  be submitted to the BoD 50 days prior to the general meeting of shareholders, including a statement from the depository bank confirming  the  number  of  shares  held  by  the  requesting shareholder(s) and that these shares are blocked from sale until the  end  of  the  general  meeting  of  shareholders.  The  BoD formulates  opinions  on  the  proposals,  which  are  published together with the motions.\n\n## Registrations in the share register\n\nThe share register of UBS Group AG, where around 190,000 shareholders are directly registered, is an internal, non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality, secrecy, privacy and data protection regulations protecting registered shareholders. In general, third parties and shareholders have no inspection rights with regard to data related to other shareholders. Disclosure of such data is permitted only in specific and limited instances. In line with the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, the disclosure of personal data as defined thereunder is only allowed with the consent of the registered shareholder and in cases where there is an overriding private or public interest or if explicitly provided for by  Swiss  law.  The  Swiss  Federal  Act  on  Financial  Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading contains specific reporting duties, such as in relation to significant shareholders (refer to 'Significant shareholders' in this section for more information). Disclosure may also be required or requested  by  a  court  of  a  competent  jurisdiction,  by  any regulatory body that regulates the conduct of UBS Group AG or by other statutory provisions.\n\nThe general rules for entry into our Swiss share register with voting rights are described in article 5 of our AoA. The same rules apply to our US transfer agent that operates the US share register for all UBS Group AG shares in a custodian account in the US, where some 230,000 US shareholders are indirectly registered via nominee companies. In order to determine the voting rights of each shareholder, our share register generally closes two business days prior to a general meeting. Our independent proxy agent processes  voting  instructions  from  shareholders  as  long  as technically possible, generally also until two business days before a general meeting. Such technical closure of our share register facilitates the determination of the actual voting rights of every shareholder that issued a voting instruction. Irrespective of this technical closure, shares that are registered in our share register are  never  immobilized  and  are  freely  tradable  at  any  time, irrespective of any issued voting instructions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to article 5 of the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG, available at ubs.com/governance , for more information about the general rules for entry into our Swiss share register",

The BoD has ultimate responsibility for the success of the Group and for delivering sustainable shareholder value within a framework of prudent and effective controls. It approves all financial statements and appoints and removes all GEB members.\n\nThe BoD of UBS AG, led by the Chairman, decides on the strategy of UBS AG upon recommendation by the President of its Executive  Board  and  exercises  the  ultimate  supervision  of management. Its ultimate responsibility for the success of UBS AG is exercised subject to the parameters set by the Group.\n\n## Members of the Board of Directors\n\nAt  the  AGM  on  8 April  2021,  Jeremy  Anderson,  William  C. Dudley, Reto Francioni, Fred Hu, Mark Hughes, Nathalie Rachou, Julie G. Richardson, Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong were reelected as members of the BoD. Beatrice Weder di Mauro did not stand for re-election; the biography of Ms. Weder di Mauro can be found on page 190 of the UBS Group AG Annual Report 2020, available under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors . Claudia B\u00f6ckstiegel and Patrick Firmenich were elected for their first terms.  At  that  same  AGM,  Axel  A.  Weber  was  re-elected Chairman,  and  Julie  G.  Richardson,  Reto  Francioni,  Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong were elected as members of the Compensation Committee. ADB Altorfer Duss & Beilstein AG was elected as independent proxy agent. Following his re-election, the BoD appointed Jeremy Anderson as Vice Chairman and Senior Independent Director of UBS Group AG.\n\nOn  20 November  2021,  the  BoD  announced  that  Colm Kelleher would be nominated for election to the BoD of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to succeed Axel A. Weber as Chairman at the forthcoming AGMs. Mr. Kelleher was the President of Morgan Stanley & Company, and responsible for Institutional Securities and Wealth Management from 2016 to 2019. In his 30-year career with Morgan Stanley, he held various senior management positions, including Chief Financial Officer during the financial crisis  in  2008.  In  addition,  the  BoD  announced  that  Lukas G\u00e4hwiler would be nominated for election to the BoD of UBS Group AG and UBS AG as Vice Chairman at the forthcoming AGMs. Having joined UBS in 2010 as a member of the GEB of UBS AG and President UBS Switzerland, Mr. G\u00e4hwiler stepped down from those roles in 2016 and has been Chairman of the board of directors of UBS Switzerland AG since 2017. He will step down from the board of directors of UBS Switzerland AG as of 5 April 2022.\n\nArticle 31 of our AoA limits the number of mandates that members  of  the  BoD  may  hold  outside  UBS  Group  to  four mandates in listed companies and five additional mandates in non-listed companies. Mandates in companies that are controlled by us or that control us are not subject to this limitation. In addition,  members  of  the  BoD  may  hold  no  more  than  10 mandates at UBS's request and 10 mandates in associations, charitable  organizations,  foundations,  trusts,  and  employee welfare foundations. As of 31 December 2021, no member of the BoD reached the thresholds described in article 31 of our AoA.\n\nThe following biographies provide information about the BoD members who were in office in 2021 and the Group Company Secretary. In addition to information  on  mandates,  the biographies  include  information  on  memberships  or  other activities or functions, as required by the SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance Directive.\n\nNo member of the BoD currently carries out or has carried out over the past three years operational management tasks within the Group; therefore, all members of the Board are non-executive members.\n\nAll members of UBS Group AG's BoD are also members of UBS AG's BoD, and committee membership is the same for both entities. The Senior Independent Director function relates only to UBS Group AG.\n\nIn 2021, UBS AG's BoD had three permanent committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Risk Committee. In addition to those permanent committees, UBS Group AG also had the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee.",

BoD members are limited to serving for a maximum of 10 consecutive terms of office; in exceptional circumstances the BoD may extend that limit.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Skills, expertise and training of the Board of Directors' in this section for more information\n\n## Organizational principles and structure\n\nFollowing each AGM, the BoD meets to appoint one or more Vice Chairmen, a Senior Independent Director, the BoD committee members (other than the Compensation Committee members, who  are  elected  by  the  shareholders)  and  the  respective committee Chairpersons. At the same meeting the BoD appoints the Group  Company  Secretary,  who,  pursuant  to  the Organization Regulations, acts as secretary to the BoD and its committees.\n\nPursuant to the AoA and the Organization Regulations, the BoD meets as often as business requires, but it must meet at least six times a year. Due to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, all meetings were organized as video calls, with the exception of the meeting  held  in  October  2021.  Additional  video  calls  were organized  during  the  reporting  period  to  facilitate  social engagement and interaction between the members of the BoD. During 2021, a total of 24 BoD meetings were held, 12 of which were attended by GEB members. Average participation in the BoD\n\nmeetings was 99%. In addition to the BoD meetings attended by GEB members, the Group CEO attended some of the meetings of the BoD without GEB participation. The meetings had an average duration of 130 minutes and covered both UBS Group AG and UBS AG. Additionally, 10 ad hoc calls were held, 6 of which were attended by GEB members. The BoD held a number of strategy workshops throughout the year, during which the results of the new CEO's in-depth strategy review were covered. These strategy workshops included deep dives on each business division and geographical region, and topics such as the definition of the purpose,  vision  and  strategic  imperatives,  as  well  as  the digitalization of the business, sustainable finance, cultural and behavioral  aspects,  including  agile  approaches  to  ways  of working. The strategy discussions were completed in October 2021, when the overarching strategy and implementation plans were agreed upon.\n\nAt the BoD meetings, each committee Chairperson provides the  BoD  with  an  update  on  current  activities  of  his  or  her committee and important committee issues.\n\nIn 2021, four UBS AG BoD meetings were held with members of the Executive Board in attendance. Standalone meetings are held regularly to discuss and agree on finance, risk, compliance, operational risk, regulatory and other topics related to UBS AG. We  also  continued  with  the  coordination  and  exchange  of information between UBS Group AG and its significant group entities. Joint meetings between the BoD of UBS Group AG and the boards of directors of the significant group entities, as well as between the respective chairs of the risk and audit committees, have been held. As in prior years, an annual workshop, attended by  independent  members  of  the  boards  of  the  Group  and significant group entities, was held.",

In 2022, this review concluded that the UBS BoD and committees operate effectively, in line with best practice, and set a high standard in comparison with leading international peers. The review also confirmed that the BoD agenda covers all important  and  relevant  topics  and  that  these  are  addressed professionally and in great depth. It further found that the BoD members are independent, highly committed and of the highest integrity, and that the Chairman provides effective leadership and direction. The review emphasized that the cooperation between the BoD and the GEB is based on mutual trust, respect and constructive dialogue. The mix of expertise in the BoD is broadbased and the quality of BoD members is high. The BoD and GEB have responded well to the economic environment, including successfully managing the firm through the COVID-19 pandemic and other significant challenges, while maintaining an appropriate focus on control and regulatory issues. The review highlights the successful CEO transition and onboarding and the well-planned and professionally executed Chairman succession process. No significant weaknesses were identified in the review, areas to be further focused on included the maintaining of a balanced  agenda  that  provides  sufficient  room  for  business performance, strategic review and growth initiatives.\n\n## BoD committees\n\nThe committees listed on the following pages assist the BoD in the performance of its responsibilities. These committees and their  charters  are  described  in  our  Organization  Regulations, available at ubs.com/governance. The committees meet as often as their business requires, but no less than four times a year in the case  of  the  Audit  Committee,  the  Risk  Committee  and  the Compensation Committee, and no less than two times a year in the case of the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee and  the  Governance  and  Nominating  Committee.  Topics  of common interest or affecting more than one committee are discussed at joint committee meetings.\n\nDuring 2021, a total of nine joint committee meetings were held for UBS Group AG (seven joint committee meetings were held simultaneously for UBS AG). The Risk Committee held two meetings  with  the  Compensation  Committee,  two  with  the Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee, and five with the Audit Committee.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n| Members in 2021           | Meeting attendance  without GEB 3   | Meeting attendance  without GEB 3   | Meeting attendance with GEB 4   | Meeting attendance with GEB 4   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Axel A.

As a group, members of the Audit Committee must have the necessary qualifications and skills to perform all their duties and together must possess financial literacy and experience in banking and risk management.\n\nThe Audit Committee itself does not perform audits; instead, it oversees the work of the external auditors, Ernst & Young Ltd, who in turn are responsible for auditing the annual financial statements of UBS Group AG and UBS AG and for reviewing the quarterly financial statements.\n\nIn particular, the Audit Committee monitors the integrity of the financial statements of UBS Group AG and UBS AG and any announcements related to financial performance, and reviews significant  financial  reporting  judgments  contained  in  them, before recommending their approval to the BoD or proposing any adjustments the Audit Committee considers appropriate.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  oversees  the  relationship  with,  and assesses the qualifications, expertise, effectiveness, independence and performance of, the external auditors and the lead audit partner,  and  supports  the  BoD  in  reaching  decisions  on  the appointment, reappointment or dismissal of the external auditors and the rotation of the lead audit partner.

The Chairperson and the committee continued to maintain regular contact with core supervisory authorities.\n\nAll Audit Committee members have accounting or related financial management expertise and, in compliance with the rules established pursuant to the 2002 US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, at least one member qualifies as a financial expert. The NYSE standards on corporate governance and Rule 10A-3 under the US Securities Exchange Act set more stringent independence requirements for members of audit committees than for the other members of the BoD. Throughout 2021, all members of the Audit Committee, in addition to satisfying our independence criteria, satisfied these requirements, in that they did not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or compensatory fees from any member of the Group other than in their capacity as a BoD member, did not hold, directly or indirectly, UBS Group AG shares in excess of 5% of the outstanding capital, and did not serve on the audit committees of more than two other public companies.",

        "page_content": "## Roles and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, Axel A. Weber will step down and Colm Kelleher will stand for election as the full-time Chairman of the BoD. The Chairman coordinates tasks within the BoD, calls BoD meetings and sets their agendas. He presides over all general meetings  of  shareholders  and  works  with  the  committee Chairpersons to coordinate the work of all BoD committees. Together  with  the  Group  CEO,  the  Chairman  undertakes responsibility for UBS's reputation, and is responsible for effective communication  with  shareholders  and  other  stakeholders, including government officials, regulators and public organizations. This is in addition to establishing and maintaining close working relationships with the Group CEO and other GEB members, and providing advice and support when appropriate.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Employees' in the 'How we create value for our stakeholders' section on page 44 and the fold-out pages of this report for information about our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors\n\nIn 2021, the Chairman met regularly with core supervisory authorities in all major locations where UBS is active. Meetings with important supervisory authorities were scheduled on an ad hoc or needs-driven basis.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities of the Vice Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director\n\nThe BoD appoints one or more Vice Chairmen and a Senior Independent Director. If the BoD appoints more than one Vice Chairman, at least one of them must be independent. Both the Vice Chairman and the Senior Independent Director support the Chairman with regard to his responsibilities and authorities and provide him with advice. In conjunction with the Chairman and the Governance and Nominating Committee, they facilitate good Group-wide corporate governance, as well as balanced leadership and control within the Group, the Board and the committees. Jeremy  Anderson  has  been  the  Vice  Chairman  and  Senior Independent Director since 2020 and it is planned that he will remain Senior Independent Director following the 2022 AGM. Lukas G\u00e4hwiler will be appointed as Vice Chairman following the 2022 AGM. The Vice Chairman is required to lead and has led meetings of the BoD in the temporary absence of the Chairman. Together with the Governance and Nominating Committee, he is tasked with the ongoing monitoring and the annual evaluation of the Chairman. He also represents UBS on behalf of the Chairman in meetings with internal or external stakeholders. The Senior Independent Director enables and supports communication and the flow of information among the independent BoD members. At least twice a year, he organizes and leads a meeting of the independent  BoD  members  without  the  participation  of  the Chairman. In 2021, two independent BoD meetings were held, covering both UBS Group AG and UBS AG, with an average participation rate of 81%  and  an  average  duration  of approximately 85 minutes. The Senior Independent Director also relays to the Chairman any issues or concerns raised by the independent BoD members and acts as a point of contact for shareholders  and  stakeholders  seeking  discussions  with  an independent BoD member.\n\n## Important business connections of independent members of the Board of Directors\n\nAs a global financial services provider and a major Swiss bank, we enter into business relationships with many large companies, including some in which our BoD members have management or independent board responsibilities. The Governance and Nominating Committee determines in each instance whether the nature of the Group's business relationship with such a company might  compromise  our  BoD  members'  capacity  to  express independent judgment.\n\nOur Organization Regulations require three-quarters of the UBS Group AG BoD members and one-third of those at UBS AG to be independent. For this purpose, independence is determined in accordance with FINMA  Circular 2017/1 'Corporate governance - banks' and the NYSE rules.\n\nIn  2021,  our  BoD  met  the  standards  of  the  Organization Regulations for the percentage of directors who are considered independent  under  the  criteria  described  above.  Since  our Chairman has a full-time contract with UBS Group AG, he is not considered independent. No other BoD member has a significant business connection to UBS or any of its subsidiaries. No BoD member currently carries out, or has carried out over the past three years, operational management tasks within the Group.\n\nAll  relationships  and  transactions  with  UBS  Group  AG's independent BoD members are conducted in the ordinary course of business and are on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons. All relationships  and  transactions  with  BoD  members'  associated companies are conducted at arm's length.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 31 Related parties' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section on page 397 of this report for more information\n\n## Checks and balances: Board of Directors and Group Executive Board\n\nWe operate under a strict dual board structure, as mandated by Swiss banking law. The separation of responsibilities between the BoD  and  the  GEB  is  clearly  defined  in  the  Organization Regulations. The BoD decides on the strategy of the Group, upon recommendations  by  the  Group  CEO,  and  exercises  ultimate supervision over management; whereas the GEB, headed by the Group  CEO,  has  executive  management  responsibility.  The functions of Chairman and Group CEO are assigned to two different people, leading to a separation of power. This structure establishes checks and balances and preserves the institutional independence of the BoD from the executive management of the Group, for which responsibility is delegated to the GEB, under the leadership of the Group CEO. No member of one board may simultaneously be a member of the other.\n\nSupervision and control of the GEB remain with the BoD. The authorities and responsibilities of the two bodies are governed by the AoA and the Organization Regulations.",

With a view to recruiting needs, the Governance and Nominating Committee uses a competencies and experience matrix to identify any gaps in the competencies considered most relevant to the BoD, taking into consideration the firm's business exposure, risk profile, strategy and geographic reach.\n\nWe  asked  our  BoD  members  to  select  their  four  key competencies from the following eight categories and to indicate whether they have ever been a CEO or chairperson of a listed company or a member of the executive board of such a company:\n\n## Key competencies\n\n- -banking (wealth management, asset management, personal and corporate banking) and insurance\n- -investment banking, capital markets\n- -finance, audit, accounting\n- -risk management, compliance and legal\n- -human resources management, including compensation\n- -technology, cybersecurity\n- -regulatory authority, central bank\n- -environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\n## Leadership experience\n\n- -experience as CEO or chairperson\n- -executive board leadership experience (e.g., as CFO, chief risk officer or COO of a listed company)\n\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee reviews these categories and ratings annually to confirm that the BoD continues to possess the most relevant experience and competencies to perform its duties.\n\nWith regard to the BoD composition after the 2021 AGM, members thereof identified all of the target competencies as being  their  key  competencies.  Particularly  strong  levels  of experience and expertise existed in these areas:\n\n- -financial services\n- -risk management, compliance and legal\n- -finance, audit, accounting\n\nFurthermore, 10 of the 12 BoD members have held or currently hold chairperson, CEO or other executive board-level leadership positions.\n\nMoreover, education remained an important priority for our BoD members.

Across all divisions and regions, an inclusive talent development and succession planning process is in place that aims to foster the personal development and Group-wide mobility of our employees. Although the recruiting process for BoD and GEB members takes into account a broad spectrum of factors, such as skills, backgrounds, experience and expertise, our approach  with  regard  to  diversity  considerations  does  not constitute a diversity policy within the meaning of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting, and Swiss law does not require UBS to maintain such a policy.\n\nIn 2021, the Chairman and the members of the BoD and the GEB  launched  several  strategic  initiatives  with  the  close involvement of the BoD and with the aim of further strengthening UBS. The succession plans for the GEB and the management layer below it are managed under the lead of the Group CEO. The BoD reviews and approves the succession plans of the GEB.\n\nFor  the  BoD,  the  Chairman  leads  a  systematic  succession planning process as illustrated in the chart below.\n\n## Board of Directors' succession planning process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur strategy and the business environment constitute the main drivers in our succession planning process for new BoD members, as they define the key competencies required on the BoD.

Both  external  and  internal  sources contribute to identifying suitable candidates. The Chairman and the members of the Governance and Nominating Committee meet with potential candidates and, with the support of the full BoD, nominations are submitted to the AGM for approval. New BoD members follow an in-depth onboarding process designed to enable them to integrate efficiently and become effective in their new  role.  Due  to  this  succession  planning  process,  the composition  of  the  BoD  is  in  line  with  the  demanding requirements of a leading global financial services firm.\n\nThe succession of both the CEO and Chairman, as well as of GEB members, was smoothly planned and is being carried out, demonstrating  the  strength  and  success  of  the  succession planning at UBS.",

The BoD also receives regular comprehensive reports, covering financial, capital, funding, liquidity, regulatory, compliance  and  legal  developments,  as  well  as  performance against plan and forecasts for the remainder of the year.

While safeguarding their independence, the external auditors closely coordinate their work with Group Internal Audit (GIA). The Audit Committee and, ultimately, the BoD supervise the effectiveness of audit work.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Board of Directors' in this section for more information about the Audit Committee\n\n## External independent auditors\n\nThe AGM in 2021 re-elected Ernst & Young Ltd (EY) as auditors for the Group for a one-year term of office. EY assumes virtually all auditing functions according to laws, regulatory requests and the AoA. Bob Jacob is the EY lead partner in charge of the overall coordination of the UBS Group financial and regulatory audits and the co-signing partner of the financial audit. In 2020, Maurice McCormick  became  the  lead  audit  partner  for  the  financial statement audit and has an incumbency limit of five years. In 2021,  Hannes  Smit  became  the  Lead  Auditor  to  the  Swiss Financial Market  Supervisory  Authority (FINMA)  with  an incumbency limit of seven years. Daniel Martin has been the cosigning  partner  for  the  FINMA  audit  since  2019,  with  an incumbency limit of seven years.\n\nDuring 2021, the Audit Committee held 13 meetings with the external auditors.\n\n## Review of UBS Group AG and UBS AG audit engagement\n\nEU rules require UBS Europe SE to rotate its external auditor in the financial year 2024. In connection with this required change, and in  consideration  of  governance  best  practices,  the  Board  of Directors considered whether it would propose to shareholders a rotation of the Group auditor concurrent with the change at UBS Europe SE. Under the direction of the Audit Committee, UBS conducted  a  formal  review  of  the  Group  audit  engagement including soliciting proposals from potential auditors. Based on the results of this assessment, the Board of Directors has decided to retain Ernst & Young as the Group's external auditor.\n\n## Audit effectiveness assessment\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the performance, effectiveness and independence of the external auditors on an annual basis. The  assessment  is  generally  based  on  interviews  with  senior management and survey feedback from stakeholders across the Group. Assessment criteria include quality of service delivery, quality and competence of the audit team, value added as part of the audit, insightfulness, and the overall relationship with EY. Based on its own analysis and the assessment results, including feedback received as part of the review of the Group audit engagement described above, the Audit Committee concluded that EY's audit has been effective.\n\n## Fees paid to external independent auditors\n\nUBS Group AG and its subsidiaries (including UBS AG) paid the following fees (including expenses) to their external independent auditors.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD million                                                                                                                                    | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             |\n| Audit                                                                                                                                          |                      |                      |\n| Global audit fees                                                                                                                              | 5533                 | 53                   |\n| Additional services classified as audit (services required by law or statute, including work of a non-recurring nature mandated by regulators) | 88                   | 10                   |\n| T Toottaall  aauuddiitt 1 1                                                                                                                    | 6611                 | 64                   |\n| Non-audit                                                                                                                                      |                      |                      |\n| Audit-related fees                                                                                                                             | 99                   | 8                    |\n| of which: assurance and attestation services                                                                                                   | 44                   | 3                    |\n| of which: control and performance reports                                                                                                      | 55                   | 5                    |\n| of which: consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards                                                                 | 00                   | 0                    |\n| Tax fees                                                                                                                                       | 11                   | 1                    |\n| All other fees                                                                                                                                 | 00                   | 0                    |\n| T Toottaall  nnoonn--aauuddiitt 1 1                                                                                                            | 1100                 | 9                    |\n\n- 1 1 Total audit and non-audit fees amounted to USD 72 million for UBS Group AG consolidated as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: USD 73 million), of which USD 43 million related to UBS AG consolidated (31 December 2020: USD 46 million).",

        "page_content": "## Special auditors for potential capital increases\n\nAt the AGM on 8 April 2021, BDO AG was reappointed as special auditors for a three-year term of office. Special auditors provide audit  opinions  in  connection  with  potential  capital  increases independently from other auditors.\n\n## Services performed and fees\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees all services provided to UBS by the external auditors. For services requiring the approval from the Audit Committee, a preapproval may be granted either for a specific  mandate  or  in  the  form  of  a  blanket  preapproval authorizing a limited and well-defined type and scope of services.\n\nThe fees (including expenses) paid to EY are set forth in the table on the previous page. In addition, EY received USD 34.1 million in 2021 (USD 32.7 million in 2020) for services performed on  behalf  of  our  investment  funds,  many  of  which  have independent fund boards or trustees.\n\nAudit work includes all services necessary to perform the audit for the Group in accordance with applicable laws and generally accepted auditing standards, as well as other assurance services that conventionally only the auditor can provide. These include statutory  and  regulatory  audits,  attestation  services  and  the review of documents to be filed with regulatory bodies. The additional services classified as audit in 2021 included several engagements for which EY was mandated at the request of FINMA.\n\nAudit-related work consists of assurance and related services traditionally performed by auditors, such as attestation services related  to  financial  reporting,  internal  control  reviews  and performance standard reviews, as well as consultation concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.\n\nTax work involves services performed by professional staff in EY's tax division and includes tax compliance and tax consultation with respect to our own affairs.\n\n'Other'  services  are  permitted  services,  which  include technical IT security control reviews and assessments.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nGIA performs the internal auditing role for the Group. It is an independent  function  that  provides  expertise  and  insights  to confirm controls are functioning correctly and highlight where UBS needs to better manage current and emerging risks. In 2021, it operated with an average headcount of 586 full-time equivalent employees.\n\nGIA  supports  the  BoD  in  discharging  its  governance responsibilities by taking a dynamic approach to audit, issue assurance and risk assessment, calling attention to key risks in order to drive action to prevent unexpected loss or damage to the firm's reputation. To support the achievement of UBS's objectives,\n\nGIA independently, objectively and systematically assesses the:\n\n- (i) soundness of the Group's risk and control culture;\n- (ii) reliability and  integrity of financial and  operational information,  including  whether  activities  are  properly, accurately  and  completely  recorded,  and  the  quality  of underlying data and models; and\n- (iii) design, operating effectiveness and sustainability of:\n- -processes to define strategy and risk appetite, as well as the overall adherence to the approved strategy;\n- -governance processes;\n- -risk management, including whether risks are appropriately identified and managed;\n- -internal controls, specifically whether they are commensurate with the risks taken;\n- -remediation activities; and\n- -processes to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies, and the Group's constitutional documents and contracts.\n\nAudit reports that include significant issues are provided to the Group  CEO,  relevant  GEB  members  and  other  responsible management. The Chairman, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the BoD are regularly informed of such issues.\n\nIn  addition,  GIA  provides  independent  assurance  on  the effective  and  sustainable  remediation  of  control  deficiencies within its mandate, taking a prudent and conservative risk-based approach and assessing at the issue level whether the root cause and the potential exposure for the firm have been holistically and sustainably  addressed.  GIA  also  cooperates  closely  with  risk control functions and internal and external legal advisors on investigations into major control issues.\n\nTo ensure GIA's independence from management, the Head GIA  reports  to  the  Chairman  of  the  BoD  and  to  the  Audit Committee, which assesses annually whether GIA has sufficient resources to perform its function, as well as its independence and performance.  In  the  Audit  Committee's  assessment,  GIA  is sufficiently  resourced  to  fulfill  its  mandate  and  complete  its auditing  objectives.  GIA's  role,  position,  responsibilities  and accountability are set out in our Organization Regulations and the Charter for GIA, available at ubs.com/governance. The Charter also  applies  to  UBS  AG's  internal  audit  function.  GIA  has unrestricted  access  to  all  accounts,  books,  records,  systems, property  and  personnel,  and  must  be  provided  with  all information  and  data  that  it  needs  to  fulfill  its  auditing responsibilities. GIA also conducts special audits at the request of the Audit Committee, or other BoD members, committees or the Group CEO in consultation with the Audit Committee.\n\nGIA enhances the efficiency of its work through coordination and close cooperation with the external auditors.",

We aim to communicate our strategy and results in a manner that enables stakeholders to gain a good understanding of how our Group operates, what our growth prospects are, and the risks that our businesses and our strategy entail. We assess feedback from analysts and investors on a regular basis and, where appropriate, reflect this in our disclosures. To continue achieving these goals, we apply the following principles in our financial reporting and disclosure:\n\n- -transparency that enhances the understanding of economic drivers and builds trust and credibility;\n\n220\n\n- -consistency  within  each  reporting  period  and  between reporting periods;\n- -simplicity that allows readers to gain a good understanding of the performance of our businesses;\n- -relevance, by  focusing  not  only  on  what  is  required  by regulation  or  statute  but  also  on  what  is  relevant  to  our stakeholders; and\n- -best practice that leads to improved standards.\n\nWe regard the continuous improvement of our disclosures as an ongoing commitment.\n\n## Financial reporting policies\n\nWe report our Group's results for each financial quarter, including a breakdown of results by business division and disclosures or key developments relating to risk management and control, capital, liquidity  and  funding  management.

If there is a major reorganization  of  our  business  divisions  or  if  changes  to accounting standards or interpretations lead to a material change in  the  Group's  reported  results,  our  results  are  restated  for previous periods as required by applicable accounting standards. These  restatements  show  how  our  results  would  have  been reported on the new basis and provide clear explanations of all relevant changes.\n\n## US disclosure requirements\n\nAs  a  foreign  private  issuer,  we  must  file  reports  and  other information,  including  certain  financial  reports,  with  the  US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the US federal securities laws.

These reports are available at ubs.com/investors and on the SEC's website, sec.gov.\n\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15e) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been carried out, under the supervision of management, including the Group CEO, the Group CFO and the Group Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Group CEO and the Group CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were  effective as of 31 December 2021. No significant changes have been made to our internal controls or to other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Consolidated financial statements' section on page 267 of this report for more information",

Richardson Chairperson of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe Board of Directors (the BoD) and I wish to thank you for your support once again at last year's Annual General Meeting (the AGM) and for sharing your views on our compensation practices over the past year. As the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, I am pleased to present our Compensation Report for 2021.\n\nThe arrival of our new CEO in late 2020 and the launch of our purpose in early 2021 resulted in a review of our Total Reward Principles and compensation framework to ensure that they are fully aligned  with  our  purpose  and  strategic  imperatives. Throughout  2021,  the  BoD  Compensation  Committee  also continued to oversee that reward reflects performance, that risktaking is appropriate and that employee interests are aligned with those of our stakeholders. Following these reviews, we applied selected enhancements to our principles while keeping our overall compensation framework broadly unchanged, as we concluded that it still remains well suited to support us in achieving our ambitions for the Group and that it provides strong alignment with shareholders' interests. Nevertheless, we have updated our Group-wide  performance  management  approach,  including\n\nevolving our Group Executive Board (GEB) performance review to reflect our strategic refresh, digital initiatives and elevated focus on  sustainability.  The  restructured  approach  fosters  an  even greater focus on GEB priorities and the success of the overall Group by assessing all GEB members against Group financial targets.\n\n## Strategy execution\n\nWe made significant progress in delivering on our strategic vision and putting clients at the center of all we do. The benefits of delivering our ecosystem to clients in a seamless way as One UBS are visible in our financial performance for 2021.\n\nOur clients continued to put their trust in us, as was evident from  the  ongoing  momentum  in  flows  and  volume  growth throughout the year. Together with favorable market conditions and investor sentiment, this led to growth across the firm. Our business momentum, our focus on fueling growth and disciplined execution led to strong financial results.\n\nSustainability is core to our purpose and ecosystem; to help us maximize our impact and direct capital to where it is needed most, we are focusing on three key areas to drive the sustainability transition:  Planet,  People  and  Partnerships.  As  a  result,  our sustainability focus and impact investing assets grew 78% in 2021 and amounted to USD 251 billion. Furthermore, UBS was again named as a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and we are proud to be recognized once again for our industry leadership in the Environmental dimension.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Financial and operating performance' in our Annual Report 2021 for further details about our Group and business division performance\n\n## Alignment to purpose\n\n- -Our purpose articulates why we do what we do, and why it matters. Our culture impacts how we do things, and it is firmly grounded in our three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors. We refreshed our three keys to success in 2021 to reflect our purpose, client promise and strategic imperatives, and to help ensure that our culture advances our strategic goals.\n- -For the past decade, those keys have defined how we work together and what we stand for, as a firm and as individuals. They continue to drive daily business decisions and are integrated into our people management processes, including hiring, performance management, compensation, promotion, talent development, training, and succession planning.\n- -Following the launch of the purpose, we reviewed our Total Reward Principles, performance management approach, and compensation framework to ensure they are fully aligned with our purpose and strategic imperatives. While we made modest adjustments, no fundamental changes were made to our compensation framework for 2021 as a result of our review.\n- -Fair and effective people management processes are key for our long-term success. Our global performance management approach underwent a comprehensive review in 2021 as part of our broader strategic refresh. Consequently, we made changes to our year-end review, objective-setting and employee feedback processes that aim to support our strategic priorities, to reinforce our high performance culture and to be simpler and more transparent. Additionally, our GEB performance review process includes more tangible measurement on quantitative outcomes and a greater focus on strategy, digitalization and sustainability matters.\n\nFind out more: ubs.com/global/en/our-firm/our-purpose",

        "page_content": "Advisory vote\n\n## 2021 key compensation themes\n\nThe feedback we seek from our shareholders on compensationrelated topics is very important to us, as we are committed to maintaining a strong link between the interests of our employees and those of our shareholders. We continued engaging with shareholders during 2021 and received overall positive feedback about our compensation framework.\n\nThe text below summarizes key compensation themes for 2021 and provides answers to the questions we most frequently receive from shareholders.\n\n## Summary of 2021 key compensation themes / responses to frequently asked questions\n\n## How was the loss resulting from the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business reflected in the compensation process?\n\nDespite  our  excellent  financial  performance  in  2021,  our reputation and financial results were negatively impacted by a significant USD 861 million pre-tax loss that we incurred in the first half of 2021 related to the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business.\n\nWe conducted a thorough review of the event and its root causes, and took decisive actions reflecting the significance of the event and its impact on our shareholders and reputation. The outcomes of the review and the actions taken by management were reviewed by the Joint Risk and Compensation Committees, as well as other internal governance bodies, as appropriate.\n\nThe  2021  Group  performance  award  pool  was  reduced significantly  as  a  consequence  of  this  event.  Our  funding approach for the performance award pool resulted in a direct and substantial reduction, which was supplemented by an additional and  significant  negative  adjustment  to  the  pool.  Overall, compensation was reduced by an amount equivalent to over half of  the  post-tax  loss.  This  reduction  had  a  direct  impact  on compensation for business and control functions, as well as for the Group Executive Board (the GEB).\n\nThe GEB performance award pool had a proportionally larger downward  adjustment  than  the  Group  pool,  to  reflect  the accountability of the GEB for the event. The GEB per-capita performance pool decreased in an otherwise exceptionally good financial year.\n\nOn an individual level, we conducted a detailed accountability review of employees involved in the event. The fact-finding for the review was supported by external legal counsel, as well as our internal investigation functions. The accountability review covered 30 employees, including relevant individuals in the GEB. The outcomes  of  the  review  impacted  performance  reviews  and compensation decisions substantially, where appropriate.\n\n## How  do  the  refreshed  financial  targets  announced  in February 2022 impact compensation?\n\nThe compensation decisions for 2021 reflect the achievements relative to the 2021 objectives that were set in early 2021 and consider the previous externally communicated targets. Similarly, we have set objectives for 2022 that consider the refreshed targets as communicated in February 2022.\n\nIn addition, for our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for 2021 performance, we have reviewed the three-year average return on common equity tier 1 (RoCET1) performance metric to reflect our strategic return ambitions, our revised financial targets and cost of capital.\n\nSpecifically, for our awards granted in early 2022 for 2021 performance,  the  required  performance  threshold  for  the minimum payout has been raised to 8%, from 6% in prior-year awards, to reflect our new financial targets. The required RoCET1 performance  for  a  maximum  payout  is  set  at  18%,  which represents the upper end of our target range. The raised threshold also increases the mid-point of the payout thresholds to better reflect our cost of capital. The linear payout design between threshold and maximum level supports our growth ambitions and our  focus  on  delivering  sustainable  performance  without encouraging excessive risk-taking.",

        "page_content": "## How does UBS support diversity and pay fairness?\n\nEnsuring fair treatment and strengthening our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) are vital to our sustainable business success. We find diverse teams better understand and relate to the needs of our equally diverse clients. Through the diversity of our employees' backgrounds and experiences, we drive innovation and better decision making.\n\nGender  diversity  is  a  key  priority  for  the  firm.  We  are particularly focused on increasing the representation of women at senior management levels. We take a multi-pronged approach in this respect, analyzing and adapting various factors that support the hiring, development and retention of women at all levels.\n\nIncreasing the ethnic minority diversity of our workforce, and a related commitment to support underrepresented talent and communities, is also a top priority across all business divisions and regions. We focus on four areas: accountability and transparency; investing in our talent; improving our culture; and leveraging our business strengths in underrepresented communities.\n\nCompensating  employees  fairly  and  consistently  is  key  to ensuring equal opportunities. We pay for performance, and we take  pay  equity  seriously.  A  strong  commitment  to  both  is embedded  in  our  compensation  policies,  and  we  regularly conduct both internal reviews and independent external audits as quality  checks.  Additionally,  these  reviews  also  allow  us  to maintain  our  certification  status  from  the  EQUAL-SALARY Foundation for our equal pay practices in Switzerland, the US, the UK, Hong Kong SAR and Singapore.\n\n## How is litigation considered in the compensation process?\n\nLitigation  and  regulatory  matters,  and  their  resolution  and remediation,  are  taken  into  consideration  throughout  the compensation  decision-making  process.  The  Compensation Committee distinguishes between current matters, where the underlying issues are within the responsibility of management, and  legacy  matters,  where  management  is  accountable  for resolving them but not responsible for the underlying issue.\n\nCurrent matters have a direct impact on the performance award pool, individual performance assessments and resulting compensation decisions, as well as the payout of deferred awards.\n\nFor legacy matters, the Compensation Committee seeks to incentivize management to resolve these matters in the best interest of shareholders and we hold management accountable for  the  effective  and  efficient  resolution  of  these  matters. Therefore,  the  performance  and  compensation  assessment reflects management's responsibility for achieving a resolution without creating an incentive to settle inappropriately or take excessive risks on such matters. In addition, the use of RoCET1, which  includes  both  current  and  legacy  matters,  in  our performance assessment for GEB performance, as well as the LTIP design, supports the focus on ensuring the cost of litigation matters has in our compensation plans a direct impact on the compensation  awarded  to  and  realized  by  our  most  senior leaders, including the GEB.\n\n## What progress has been made on resolving the French cross-border matter and how is this reflected in GEB compensation?\n\nIn December 2021, UBS filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court regarding the decision of the Court of Appeal relating to the French cross-border matter. This matter remains ongoing and was considered in the decision-making process for our 2021 performance award pool.\n\nThe use of the RoCET1 metric aims to ensure the cost of litigation matters, including the French cross-border matter, has an ongoing and direct impact on the compensation awarded and realized  by  our  most  senior  leaders,  including  the  GEB. Additionally, when determining the 2019 performance award pool,  the  impact  of  the  French  cross-border  matter  was considered in our decision making.\n\nFurthermore, as outlined in our 2019 Compensation Report, up to CHF 7.9 million, or 30%, of the 2019 LTIP awards at grant for GEB members active in March 2017, as well as the Chairman of the BoD's unvested share award, continues to be at risk and directly linked to the final resolution of the French cross-border matter. In addition, a malus clause allows the Compensation Committee to assess any new information that becomes available in the future and to retrospectively reduce the 2019 LTIP award by up to the full amount if such new information would have impacted  our  compensation  decision  in  2019.  This  matter continues to be ongoing and, once resolved, the final outcome will be reflected in the final amounts delivered to relevant current and former employees.\n\n## Impact of litigation matters on the LTIP\n\nLong-T erm Incentive Plan (L TIP)\n\n## LTIP design (all years)\n\nAdded measure for 2019 LTIP award (GEB members active in March 2017)\n\n## Performance metric\n\n(RoCET1 directly impacted by litigation costs)\n\n## Fact-based adjustment\n\n(up to CHF 7.3 million of the 2019 LTIP at grant is directly linked to the fi nal resolution of the French cross-border matter)\n\n(As disclosed in the Compensation Report 2019.)\n\n## Malus adjustment\n\n(2019 LTIP award may be reduced based on new information that would have impacted the compensation for 2019)",

In 2021, we revised the Group CEO and GEB scorecards and further enhanced the link between  ESG  and  compensation  by  introducing  explicit sustainability objectives under 'Strategic & Growth' in the nonfinancial goal category. These sustainability objectives are linked to  our  priorities,  and  their  progress  is  measured  via  robust quantitative metrics and  qualitative criteria. Sustainability objectives are individually assessed for each GEB member, and consequently directly impact their performance assessments and compensation decisions.\n\nIn addition, in the performance award pool funding across the Group, ESG is also reflected through an assessment of progress made toward targets linked to our focus areas of Planet, People (including progress made toward our diversity ambitions) and Partnerships, alongside other key dimensions.\n\nTherefore  ESG  is  taken  into  consideration  when  the Compensation Committee assesses not only what results were achieved but also how they were achieved.\n\nFor 2021, we established robust and concrete targets, and made good progress toward achieving them. We continue to increase our focus on this topic.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Environmental, Social and Governance considerations' in the 'Compensation philosophy and governance' section of this report for more information\n\n## How does UBS promote and support the health and wellbeing of employees?\n\nSupporting employee health and well-being remained a priority in 2021. We are committed to helping employees thrive in their current  roles  and  deliver  sustainable  performance  over  time. Regular 'pulse' surveys gauged employees' views on remote work, stress, communication and other aspects. Resources to support  holistic  well-being  featured  a  bespoke  eLearning curriculum, physical and mental health initiatives, volunteering opportunities,  increased  certain  local  benefits  offerings,  and financial education events.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n\n## How does UBS respond to the increasing competition for talent?\n\nWe  continue  to  see  increasing  competition  for  talent.  These pressures  come  from  our  direct  competitors  but  also  other organizations including technology, consulting and new entrants or disruptors, such as fintech firms. As a recognized employer of choice, we continue to broaden and deepen our talent pools through ongoing talent development and continued investment in our employees. We take careful consideration to reflect pay for performance  and  competitive  pay  in  our  decision  making. Furthermore, as our compensation approach includes substantial deferral, we balance incentivizing performance with retention in order to promote a sustainable workforce.",

This decrease in an otherwise exceptionally good financial  year contrasts with the Group pool increase of 10%.

In addition to the  base salaries, it also includes role-based allowances in response to EU Capital Requirements  Directive IV, estimated standard contributions to retirement benefit plans, and other benefits. The  proposed amount provides flexibility in light of potential changes of GEB composition or roles,  competitive considerations where potential additional role-based allowances may be required, and  other factors (e.g., changes in FX rates or benefits). |\n| BoD  compensation          | The Board of Directors proposes a  maximum aggregate amount of  compensation of CHF 13,000,000  for the members of the Board of  Directors for the period from the  2022 AGM to the 2023 AGM. | The proposed amount is unchanged compared with the previous period and includes the total  compensation of the nominated Chairman and Vice Chairman.

In 2021, following the launch of our purpose, we reviewed our Total Reward Principles and compensation framework to confirm they are fully aligned with our purpose and support our strategic imperatives.\n\nThis ensures that the interests of our employees are aligned with those of our clients and other stakeholders.\n\nTherefore, our compensation approach supports our capital strength and risk management, and provides for simplification and  efficiency.  It  encourages  employees  to  focus  on  client centricity, connectivity and sustainable impact in everything we do. Moreover, we reward behaviors that help build and protect the firm's reputation, specifically accountability with integrity, collaboration and innovation. Compensation for each employee is  based  on  individual,  team,  business  division  and  Group performance, within the context of the markets in which we operate.\n\n## Total Reward Principles\n\nOur Total Reward Principles apply to all employees globally, but vary in certain locations according to local legal requirements and regulations and practices. The table below provides a summary of our Total Reward Principles.\n\n| Support our purpose and strategy                                                     | Our compensation approach supports the firm's purpose and strategy, fosters engagement among  employees and aligns their long-term interests with those of clients and stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Attract, retain and connect a diverse, talented  workforce                           | We embrace a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusiveness.

In this way, our investment in a connected workforce supports the  sustainability of the organization.                                                                                                                    |\n| Apply a pay-for-performance approach to  support development and our ways of working | The setting of clear objectives and a thorough evaluation of what was achieved and how it was  achieved, combined with effective communication, promote clarity, accountability and establish a  strong link between pay and performance. This approach emphasizes our Behaviors, which are  accountability with integrity, collaboration and innovation. |\n| Reinforce sustainable growth and support long- term value creation                   | Compensation is appropriately balanced between fixed and variable elements and delivered over an  appropriate period to support our growth ambitions and sustainable performance.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Support risk awareness and appropriate risk- taking                                  | Our compensation structure encourages employees to have a focus on risk management and behave  consistently with the firm's risk framework and appetite, thereby anticipating and managing risks  effectively to protect our capital and reputation.                                                                                                      |\n\n## Our Total Reward approach\n\nAt UBS, we apply a holistic Total Reward approach, generally consisting of fixed compensation (base salary and role-based allowances, if applicable), performance awards, pension contributions  and  benefits.  Our  Total  Reward  approach  is structured to support sustainable results and growth ambitions.\n\nFor  employees  whose  total  compensation  exceeds  certain levels, performance awards are delivered in a combination of cash, deferred contingent capital awards and deferred sharebased awards.\n\nA substantial portion of performance awards is deferred and vests over a five-year period (or longer for certain regulated employees).  This  deferral  approach  supports  alignment  of employee and investor interests, our capital base and the creation of sustainable shareholder value.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Compensation elements for all employees' in the 'Group compensation' section of this report for more information\n\nNote: illustrative\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Compensation Committee consists of independent BoD members, who are elected annually by shareholders at the AGM, and  is  responsible  for  governance  and  oversight  of  our compensation process and practices. This includes the alignment between  pay  and  performance,  and  ensuring  that  the compensation framework supports appropriate risk awareness and management, as well as appropriate risk-taking. In 2021, to additionally support the connection between the Compensation Committee  and  the  Risk  Committee,  the  Compensation Committee  Chairperson  was  also  a  member  of  the  Risk Committee.\n\nAnnually,  and  on  behalf  of  the  BoD,  the  Compensation Committee:\n\n- -reviews our Total Reward Principles;\n- -approves key features of the compensation framework and plans  for  the  non-independent  Board  members  and  GEB members;\n- -reviews performance award funding throughout the year and proposes, upon proposal of the Group CEO, the final annual Group performance award pool for BoD approval;\n- -upon proposal of the Group CEO, reviews the performance framework of the other GEB members;\n- -upon proposal of the Group CEO, proposes the performance assessments and the individual total compensation for the other GEB members for approval by the BoD;\n- -upon proposal of the Chairman, proposes financial and nonfinancial performance targets and objectives for the Group CEO  and  the  Group  CEO's  performance  assessment  for approval by the Board;\n- -approves the total compensation for the Chairman and the non-independent Board members;\n- -proposes,  upon  proposal  of  the  Chairman,  the  total compensation for the Group CEO for approval by the Board;\n- -proposes to the BoD the maximum aggregate amounts of BoD compensation and GEB fixed compensation and the aggregate amount of variable compensation for the GEB for approval by the general meeting of the shareholders;\n- -upon proposal of the Chairman, proposes the remuneration / fee framework for independent Board members for approval by the Board;\n\n- -upon proposal of the Chairman and Group CEO, approves the remuneration / fee frameworks for external supervisory board members of Significant Group Entities and be informed of remuneration / fee frameworks for external supervisory board members of Significant Regional Entities; and\n- -proposes to the BoD for approval the annual compensation report and approves other material public disclosures on UBS compensation matters.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is required to meet at least four times each year. All meetings in 2021 were held in the presence of the Chairman and the Group CEO and most were attended by external advisors. Individuals, including the Chairman and the Group CEO, are not permitted to attend a meeting or participate in a discussion on their own performance and compensation.\n\nAfter the meetings, the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee reports to the BoD on the Compensation Committee's activities and discussions and, if necessary, submits proposals for approval by the full BoD. Compensation Committee meeting minutes are also sent to all members of the BoD.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, the members of the Compensation Committee  were  Julie  G.  Richardson  (Chairperson),  Reto Francioni, Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Board of Directors' in the 'Corporate governance' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information\n\n## External advisors\n\nThe Compensation Committee may retain external advisors to support it in fulfilling its duties. In 2021, HCM International Ltd. (HCM) provided independent advice on compensation matters. HCM holds no other mandates with UBS. Additionally, Willis Towers Watson provided the Compensation Committee with data on market trends and pay levels. Various subsidiaries of Willis Towers Watson provide similar information to Human Resources in relation to compensation for employees. Willis Towers Watson holds no other compensation-related mandates with UBS.\n\n## The Risk Committee's role in compensation\n\nThe Risk Committee, a committee of the BoD, works closely with the Compensation Committee to ensure that our compensation framework appropriately reflects risk awareness and management, and ensures appropriate risk-taking. It supervises and sets appropriate risk management and risk control principles and  is  regularly  briefed  on  how  risk  is  factored  into  the compensation process. It also monitors the involvement of Group Risk Control and Compliance and Operational Risk in compensation and reviews risk-related aspects of the compensation process.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/governance for more information",

In 2021, we revised the Group CEO and GEB scorecards and further enhanced the link between  ESG  and  compensation  by  introducing  explicit sustainability objectives under 'Strategic & Growth' in the nonfinancial goal category. These sustainability objectives are linked to  our  priorities,  and  their  progress  is  measured  via  robust quantitative  metrics  and  qualitative  criteria.  The  table  below provides an overview of our metrics and progress achieved in 2021. Sustainability objectives are individually assessed for each GEB member, and consequently directly impact their performance assessments and compensation decisions.\n\nIn addition, in the performance award pool funding across the Group, ESG is also reflected through an assessment of progress made against targets linked to our focus areas of Planet, People (including progress made against our diversity ambitions) and Partnerships, alongside other key dimensions. Therefore ESG is taken into consideration when the Compensation Committee assesses not only what results were achieved but also how they were achieved.\n\nFor 2021, we established robust and concrete targets, and made good progress toward achieving them. We continue to increase our focus on this topic.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'GEB performance assessments' in the 'Compensation for GEB members' section of this report for more information about the GEB performance measurement process\n- \u203a Refer to 'Our focus on sustainability and climate,' 'Employees' and 'Society' in the 'How we create value for our stakeholders' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/gri for more information about ESG-related topics\n\n## Fair pay and pay for performance\n\nCompensating employees fairly and consistently is key to ensuring equal opportunities. We pay for performance, and we take pay equity seriously. A strong commitment to both is embedded in our compensation policies, and we conduct both internal reviews and independent external audits as quality checks. If we uncover gaps that  cannot  be  explained  by  business  factors  or  appropriate personal  factors  -  such  as  experience,  role,  responsibility, performance or location - we explore the root causes of those gaps and address them.\n\nAdditionally, our regular monitoring and review processes also allow us to maintain our certification status with the EQUALSALARY Foundation for our equal pay practices in Switzerland, the US,  the  UK,  Hong  Kong  SAR  and  Singapore.  The  firm  also successfully completed an equal pay analysis in Switzerland in 2020, as required by the Swiss Federal Act on Gender Equality. The results of the analysis confirmed that we are fully compliant with Swiss equal pay standards. These holistic certifications are a testament to our  well-established  equal  opportunity  environment  and  the strength of our human resources practices, including performance and reward. In 2021, we continued to monitor pay fairness and addressed any unexplained gaps to ensure that all employees are paid fairly.",

We find diverse teams better understand and relate to the needs of our equally diverse clients. Through  the  diversity  of  our  employees' backgrounds and experiences, we drive innovation and better decision making. Our aim, therefore, is to shape a diverse and inclusive organization that is innovative, provides outstanding service to our clients and offers equitable opportunities so that every employee can thrive.\n\nUBS is a strong supporter of the UN Standards of Conduct for Business  anti-discrimination  guidelines.  Additionally,  we  are signatories to the UN-backed Women's Empowerment Principles, the UK's Women in Finance Charter and Race at Work Charter, and the Corporate Call to Action in the US. Philosophically, we take a broad approach to DE&I, focusing on a range of aspects, including inclusive leadership, age, gender, race and ethnicity, LGBTQ+, disability, and veterans. Building inclusive leadership skills,  increasing  gender  and  ethnic  diversity,  and  equitable policies and practices were our leading priorities in 2021.\n\nGender diversity is a key priority for the firm. We are particularly focused on increasing the representation of women at senior management levels. We take a multi-pronged approach in this respect, analyzing and adapting various factors that support the hiring, development and retention of women at all levels. For example, our interviews for open roles are expected to include qualified diverse candidates, and our interview questions seek to gauge inclusive leadership competencies for executive roles.\n\nTo ensure we are making progress, we hold ourselves and our leaders accountable. For example, in early 2020 we publicly stated our aspiration to have 30% of all Director and above roles held by women by 2025. At the end of 2021, that figure stood at 26.7%, up from 26.0% in 2020. As of 31 December 2021, 25% of GEB members were female and we expect to increase this ratio to 33% in early 2022 after the designated Group Chief Financial Officer joins the firm. In addition, 27% of senior managers who reported directly to the Group Executive Board (the GEB) in 2021 were female. These aspirations are considered in the determination of the annual performance award pool and are included in the explicit sustainability objectives under 'Strategic & Growth' for the GEB, as outlined in the table on the previous page.\n\nIncreasing the ethnic minority diversity of our workforce, and a related commitment to support underrepresented talent and communities, is also a top priority across all business divisions and regions. We focus on four areas: accountability and transparency; investing in our talent; improving our culture; and leveraging our business strengths in underrepresented communities.\n\nWe take a country-by-country approach, in close collaboration with relevant business and jurisdictional entities. This is because legislation, legal requirements and progress toward racial and ethnic equality vary significantly across the locations in which we do business. In the short term, the largest share of our efforts is focused on Switzerland, the US and the UK. In Switzerland, we began collecting ethnicity data on a voluntary basis in 2021, aimed at understanding the current representation within our local  workforce.  Our  2025  aspiration  is  to  achieve  a  26% representation of ethnic minorities at Director level and above in the UK and the US. As of the end of 2021, our representation was 20.1% in the US and 21.3% in the UK.\n\nOur  employee  networks  are  strong  partners  in  our  ethnic diversity strategy.  Throughout  2021,  our  ethnicity-focused MOSAIC networks globally facilitated numerous events for staff in every region to increase awareness and personal accountability along with specialized educational sessions for network members. In addition, a community of more than 480 Diversity and Inclusion Ambassadors acts as a resource for employee advice and coaching on conversations about various diversity and inclusion-related topics.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring a workplace where employees are fairly treated, with equitable employment and advancement opportunities for all. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind, including sexual harassment, and we take measures to prevent all forms of harassment, bullying, victimization and retaliation. Our policies, procedures, employee and line manager education, and awareness materials all encourage employees to raise concerns, which they may do openly or anonymously. An internal antiharassment  officer  appointed  by  the  Group  Head  Human Resources provides an independent view of the firm's various processes  and  procedures  to  prevent  harassment  and  sexual misconduct.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/diversity for additional information about our priorities, commitments and progress, and the Sustainability Report 2021, available from 11 March 2022 under 'Annual reporting' at ubs.com/investors , for our management practices and detailed employee data, including gender- and regionspecific data\n- \u203a Refer to 'Employees' in the 'How we create value for our stakeholders' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information.",

        "page_content": "## Performance award pool funding\n\nOur compensation philosophy focuses on balancing performance with appropriate risk-taking, retaining talented employees and shareholder returns. Our overall performance award pool funding percentage reduces as financial performance increases. In years of strong financial performance, this prevents excessive compensation and results in an increased proportion of profit before performance awards being available for distribution to shareholders or growing the Group's capital. In years where performance declines, the performance award pool will generally decrease; however, the funding percentage may increase.\n\nOur performance award pool funding framework is based on Group and business division performance, including achievements against defined performance measures. In assessing performance, we also consider industry peers, market competitiveness of our results and pay position, as well as progress against our strategic objectives,  including  returns,  risk-weighted  assets  and  cost efficiency. The Risk and Compliance functions support our holistic reflection and consideration of the financial and non-financial impact (including reputation) of risk matters. We further consider the firm's risk profile and culture, the extent to which operational risks and audit issues have been identified and resolved, and the success of risk reduction initiatives including significant events.\n\nThe funding for Group Functions is linked to overall Group performance  and  reflects  headcount,  workforce  location  and demographics.  For  each  functional  area  quantitative  and\n\nqualitative assessments evaluate service quality, risk management and financial achievements. Our decisions also balance consideration of financial performance with a range of factors, including DE&I and other ESG metrics, the impact of litigation, regulatory costs, the effect of changes in financial accounting standards, capital returns, and relative total shareholder return.\n\nBefore making its final proposal to the BoD, the Compensation Committee  considers  the  CEO's  proposals  and  can  apply  a positive or negative adjustment to the performance award pool. For example, despite our excellent financial results in 2021, our reputation and financial results were negatively impacted by a loss related to the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business. As a consequence, the 2021 Group performance award pool was reduced significantly. Our funding approach for the performance  award  pool  resulted  in  a  direct  and  substantial reduction, which was supplemented by a significant negative adjustment to the pool.\n\nTaking into consideration the above proposals and factors, over  the  past  nine  years  the  Compensation  Committee  has approved adjustments to the performance award pool, resulting in downward adjustments in all but one year.\n\n- \u203a Refer to '2021 Group performance outcomes' in the 'Group compensation' section of this report\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Group performance' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information about our results",

GEB members must reach their minimum shareholding requirements within five years from their appointment and retain it throughout their tenure. The total number of UBS shares held by a GEB member consists of any vested or unvested shares and any privately held shares. GEB\n\nmembers may not sell any UBS shares before they reach the minimum ownership thresholds mentioned below. At the end of 2021, all GEB members met their share ownership requirements, except for those appointed within the last four years, who still have time to build up and meet the required share ownership.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, our GEB members held shares with an aggregate value of approximately USD 191 million, demonstrating their commitment to our strategy and alignment with shareholders.\n\nShare ownership requirements\n\n| Group CEO         | min. 1,000,000 shares   | Must be built up within five years from their appointment and retained throughout   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other GEB members | min. 500,000 shares     | Must be built up within five years from their appointment and retained throughout   |\n\n## GEB base salary and role-based allowance\n\nEach GEB member receives a fixed base salary, which is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. The 2021 annual base salary for the Group CEO role was CHF 2.5 million and has remained unchanged since 2011. The other GEB members each received  a  base  salary  of  CHF 1.5  million  (or  local  currency equivalent), also unchanged since 2011.\n\nOver the course of 2021, two GEB members held a UK Senior Management Function (SMF) role for one of our UK entities. In addition to base salary, role-based allowances were part of their fixed compensation.\n\nAt the AGM, shareholders are asked to approve the maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation for GEB members for the following financial year.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Supplemental information' section of this report for more information about MRTs and SMFs\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Say-on-pay' section of this report for more information about the AGM vote on fixed compensation for the GEB\n\n## Caps on the GEB performance award pool\n\nThe size of the GEB performance award pool may not exceed 2.5% of the Group profit before tax. This limits the overall GEB compensation based on the firm's profitability.\n\nFor 2021, the Group's profit before tax was USD 9.5 billion and the total GEB performance award pool was CHF 79.8 million. The GEB performance award pool as a percentage of Group profit before tax was 0.9%, well below the 2.5% cap.\n\nIn line with the individual compensation caps on the proportion of fixed pay to variable pay for all GEB members (introduced in 2013), the Group CEO's granted performance award is capped at five times his fixed compensation. Granted performance awards of other GEB members are capped at seven times their fixed compensation (or two times for GEB members who are also Material  Risk  Takers  (MRTs)).  For  2021,  performance  awards granted to GEB members and the Group CEO were, on average, 3.2 times their fixed compensation  (excluding one-time replacement awards, benefits and contributions to retirement plans).\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Performance award pool funding' in the\n- 'Compensation philosophy and governance' section of this\n- report for more information\n\n## GEB employment contracts and severance terms\n\nGEB members' employment contracts do not include severance terms  or  supplementary  pension  plan  contributions  and  are subject to a notice period of at least six months. A GEB member leaving  UBS  before  the  end  of  a  performance  year  may  be considered for a performance award. Such awards are subject to approval by the BoD, and ultimately by the shareholders at the AGM.\n\n## Benchmarking for GEB members\n\nWhen recommending performance awards for the Group CEO and  the  other  GEB  members,  the  Compensation  Committee reviews the respective total compensation for each role against a financial industry peer group. The peer group is selected based on comparability of their size, business mix, geographic presence and the  extent  to  which  they  compete  with  us  for  talent.  The Compensation  Committee  considers  our  peers'  strategies, practices and pay levels, as well as their regulatory environment; it also periodically reviews other firms' pay levels or practices, including  both  financial  and  non-financial  sector  peers  as applicable. The total compensation for a GEB member's specific role  considers  the  compensation  paid  by  our  peers  for  a comparable  role  and  performance  within  the  context  of  our organizational profile. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and approves the peer group composition.\n\nThe table below presents the composition of our peer group as  approved  by  the  Compensation  Committee  for  the  2021 performance year.\n\n| Bank of America   | Goldman Sachs      |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Barclays          | HSBC               |\n| BlackRock         | JPMorgan Chase     |\n| BNP Paribas       | Julius Baer        |\n| Citigroup         | Morgan Stanley     |\n| Credit Suisse     | Standard Chartered |\n| Deutsche Bank     | State Street       |",

        "page_content": "## GEB performance assessments\n\nFor 2021, we have further enhanced the performance assessment for GEB members to ensure it is fully aligned with the firm's new purpose and strategic objectives. We assess GEB members against a set of Group financial targets, non-financial objectives and Behaviors. Under the non-financial objectives we introduced the new categories of Core Job, which covers job-specific, risk and people objectives, as well as Strategic & Growth, which covers strategy, digital and ESG objectives. The restructured approach fosters an even greater focus on GEB priorities and the success of the Group overall among all GEB members, and strengthens the understanding and importance of interdependence within and\n\nacross the GEB. At the same time, it creates stronger individual accountability, and further increases the focus on core activities.\n\nThe Compensation Committee exercises its judgment with respect to the performance achieved relative to the prior year, the strategic plan and competitors, and considers the Group CEO's proposals. The Compensation Committee's proposals are subject to approval by the BoD.\n\nThe Compensation Committee, and then the full BoD, follows a similar process for the Group CEO, except that the proposal comes from the Chairman of the BoD.\n\n## Overview of the GEB compensation determination process\n\nThe compensation for the Group CEO and the other GEB members is governed by a rigorous process under Compensation Committee and BoD oversight. The chart below shows how compensation for all GEB members is determined.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is involved at all stages of the performance and total compensation decision-making process for  the Group CEO and the other GEB members, for review and approval by the BoD.\n\n## Objective setting\n\n## Compensation determination\n\nFinancial targets are based on Group performance measures.\n\nNon-financial objectives are related to core job, strategic and growth.\n\nBehaviors objectives are related to the three UBS Behaviors of accountability with integrity, collaboration and innovation.\n\nFinancial targets weight: 60% Non-financial objectives weight: 30% Behavior objectives weight: 10%\n\nTogether with the BoD Chairman, proposes performance targets and objectives for the Group CEO for approval by the BoD.\n\nTogether with the Group CEO, reviews the performance framework for the other GEB members.\n\nWhen determining actual pay levels, the Compensation Committee factors in:\n\n- -  financial performance;\n- -  performance assessment;\n- -  relative performance versus peers; and\n- -  compensation market benchmarks and trends.\n\nFinal compensation decisions for GEB members consider the Group CEO's proposal  (the Group CEO makes no proposal on his own awards).\n\nProposes to the BoD:\n\n- -  together with the BoD Chairman, the total compensation for the Group CEO; and\n- -  together with the Group CEO, the individual total compensation for the other GEB members.\n\nThe final decision on the aggregate amount is  subject to shareholder approval.\n\n## Performance assessment\n\nFinancial results are assessed quantitatively based on full-year financial results versus predetermined targets and plan figures.\n\nNon-financial objectives are assessed predominantly based on achievements relative to quantitative key performance indicators.\n\nBehaviors objectives are assessed qualitatively.\n\nThe achievements of non-financial measures and Behaviors are determined in three performance categories, outlined on the next page. The total of all weighted achievement scores cannot exceed 100%.\n\nTogether with the BoD Chairman, propose the Group CEO's performance assessment for approval by the BoD.\n\nTogether with the Group CEO, propose the performance assessments of the other GEB members for approval by the BoD.\n\n## Decision-making pr ocess\n\n## Role of the Compensation Committee",

He led the Group toward stronger client centricity and improved the delivery of the bank's ecosystem  to  clients.  He  also  delivered  a  successful  strategic refresh in 2021 and re-positioned the bank's sustainability efforts.\n\nMr. Hamers successfully led the development of the purpose statement, established the client promise, and  strategic imperatives, including development of concrete transformation initiatives to position the firm for future growth. He was the most important  ambassador  for  the  firm's  refreshed  culture  and behavior program.\n\nFurthermore, Ralph Hamers continuously displayed high risk awareness and set a strong and consistent tone from the top to promote an effective risk culture. He also demonstrated strong leadership  and  accountability  in  dealing  with  the  loss  event resulting from the default of a US-based client of our prime brokerage business.\n\nAdditionally, the BoD recognized that Mr. Hamers personally championed the drive towards becoming more digital across the organization, along with his continuous push for technology as a differentiator for both clients and employees.\n\nThe BoD acknowledged that Mr. Hamers also championed key changes across the organization to further promote agile ways of working,  simplification  and  empowerment.  He  continued  to increase the Group's focus on delivering against diversity and ethnicity ambitions.\n\nMr. Hamers demonstrated strong leadership on ESG topics, including  establishing  a  group-wide  sustainability  and  impact organization. He drove the definition of a net-zero framework and focused  the  organization  on  delivering  against  select  UN Sustainable Development goals, as well as establishing ambitions and making progress on key focus areas, including Planet, People and Partnerships.\n\nThe table below illustrates the assessment criteria used to evaluate the achievements of Mr. Hamers in 2021.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Weight   | Performance measures              | 2021 targets   | 2021  results   | Achieve- ment 2   | Weighted assess- ment   | 2021 commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 20%      | Reported Group Profit  before Tax | USD 6.9bn      | USD 9.5bn       | 100% 2            | 20%                     | - Profit before tax increased 16% to USD 9.5 billion,  reflecting strong business momentum with income up  in all regions and good cost control.

Mr. Hamers acted as a  role model  in accepting  ownership and accountability .

        "page_content": "## Group compensation\n\n## Compensation elements for all employees\n\nAll elements  of  pay  are  considered  when  making  our compensation decisions. We regularly review our principles and compensation framework in order to remain competitive and aligned with stakeholders. In 2021, we made no material changes to  our  overall  framework.  We  will  continue  to  review  our approach to salaries and performance awards, considering market developments, our performance and our commitment to deliver sustainable returns to shareholders.\n\n## Base salary and role-based allowance\n\nEmployees' fixed compensation (e.g., base salary) reflects their level of skill, role and experience, as well as local market practice. Base salaries are usually paid monthly or fortnightly, in line with local market practice. We offer competitive base salaries that reflect  location,  function  and  role.  Salary  increases  generally consider promotions, skill set, performance and overall responsibility.\n\nIn addition to base salary, and as part of fixed compensation, some  employees  may  receive  a  role-based  allowance.  This allowance is a shift in the compensation mix between fixed and variable compensation, not an increase in total compensation. It reflects the market value of a specific role and is fixed, nonforfeitable compensation. Unlike salary, a role-based allowance is paid only if the employee is in a specific role. Similar to previous years, 2021 role-based allowances consisted of a cash portion and, where applicable, a blocked UBS share award.\n\n## Pensions and benefits\n\nWe  offer  certain  benefits  for  all  employees,  such  as  health insurance and retirement benefits. These vary depending on the employee's location and are reviewed periodically for competitiveness. Pension contributions and pension plans also vary in accordance with local requirements and market practice. However, pension plan rules in any one location are generally the same for all employees, including management.\n\nGEB members' pension contributions and benefits are in line with local practices for other employees. There are no enhanced or supplementary pension contributions for the GEB.\n\n## Performance award\n\nMost of our employees are eligible for an annual performance award.  The  level  of  this  award,  where  applicable,  generally depends  on  the  firm's  overall  performance,  the  employee's business division, team and individual performance, and behavior, reflecting their overall contribution to the firm's results. These awards are in line with applicable local employment conditions and at the discretion of the firm.\n\nIn addition to the firm's Pillars and Principles, Behaviors related to accountability with integrity, collaboration and innovation are part of the performance management approach. Therefore, when assessing performance, we consider not only what was achieved but also how it was achieved.",

        "page_content": "Advisory vote\n\nCorporate governance and compensation | Compensation\n\n## Our deferred compensation plans\n\nTo reinforce our emphasis on sustainable performance and risk management, and our focus on achieving growth ambitions, we deliver  part  of  our  employees'  annual  variable  compensation through  deferred  compensation  plans.  We  believe  that  our approach,  with  a  single  incentive  decision  and  a  mandatory deferral,  is  transparent  and  well  suited  to  implementing  our compensation philosophy and delivering sustainable performance.  This  aligns  the  interests  of  our  employees  and shareholders and appropriately links compensation to longer-term sustainable performance.\n\nOur mandatory deferral approach applies to all employees with regulatory-driven deferral requirements or total compensation greater than USD / CHF 300,000. Certain regulated employees, such as Senior Management Functions (SMFs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), are subject to additional requirements (e.g., an additional  non-financial  conduct-related  performance  metric under the LTIP, more stringent deferral requirements, additional blocking periods). In addition, SMFs and MRTs receive 50% of their cash portion in the form of immediately vested shares, which are blocked for 12 months after grant.\n\n## Variable compensation elements by employee category\n\nDeferred compensation elements\n\n| Employee category                                  | Cash   | LTIP   | EOP   | DCCP   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|--------|\n| GEB and selected senior management                 |        |        |       |        |\n| Asset Management senior management                 |        |        | 1     |        |\n| Employees subject to  mandatory deferral framework |        |        | 1     |        |\n\n- 1 AM employees and selected AM senior staff in investment areas receive AM EOP (notional funds) instead of EOP (notional shares) in order to align their compensation more closely with industry standards. AM employees in  non-investment areas receive both EOP and AM EOP in their plan mix.\n\nThe deferred amount increases at higher marginal rates in line with the value of the performance award. The effective deferral rate therefore depends on the amount of the performance award and the amount of total compensation.\n\nWe believe our deferral regime has one of the longest vesting periods in the industry. The weighted average deferral period (for non-regulated employees) is 4.4 years for GEB members and ranges from 3.5 to 4 years for employees below GEB level. Additionally,  from  time  to  time,  we  may  utilize  alternative deferred compensation arrangements to remain competitive in specific business areas.\n\nTo  further  promote  sustainable  performance,  all  of  our deferred compensation plans include employment conditions and malus conditions. These enable the firm to reduce or fully forfeit unvested deferred awards under certain circumstances, pursuant to performance and harmful acts provisions. In addition, forfeiture is triggered in cases where employment has been terminated for cause.\n\nOur share delivery obligations related to notional share awards are satisfied by delivering treasury shares, which are purchased in the market, to employees at vesting.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 28 Employee benefits: variable compensation' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Supplemental information' section of this report for more information about MRTs and SMFs",

        "page_content": "## Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe LTIP is a mandatory deferral plan for senior leaders of the Group (i.e., GEB members and selected senior management). For the 2021 performance year, we granted LTIP awards to 117 employees at a fair value of 67.7% of maximum. The value was calculated by an independent third party using a well-established valuation methodology.\n\nThe performance metrics of the share-based LTIP awards are average  return  on  CET1  capital  (RoCET1)  and  relative  total shareholder return (rTSR) over a three-year performance period starting on 1 January in the year of grant. Performance outcomes and actual payout levels will be disclosed at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe three-year average RoCET1 performance metric reflects our strategic return ambitions and considers our revised financial targets, as well as our cost of capital as outlined below:\n\n- -the required RoCET1 performance for a maximum payout is set at 18%, which represents the upper end of our target range;\n- -the required performance threshold for the minimum payout has been raised to 8% from 6% in prior-year awards to reflect our new financial targets communicated in February 2022, increasing the mid-point of the payout thresholds to better reflect our cost of capital; and\n- -the linear payout design between threshold and maximum level  supports  our  growth  ambitions  and  our  focus  on delivering  sustainable  performance  without  encouraging excessive risk-taking.\n\nThe rTSR performance metric over the three-year period further aligns the interests of employees with those of shareholders:\n\n- -the metric compares the total shareholder return (the TSR) of UBS  with  the  TSR  of  an  index  consisting  of  listed  Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) as determined by the Financial Stability Board (excluding UBS Group);\n- -the G-SIBs are independently defined and reflect companies with  a  comparable  risk  profile  and  impact  on  the  global economy;\n\n## LTIP payout illustration\n\n- - The final number of notional shares vesting will vary based on the achievement versus the performance metrics.\n- - Linear payout between threshold and maximum performance.\n- - Vesting levels are a percentage of the maximum opportunity of the LTIP and cannot exceed 100%.\n- - Full forfeiture for performance below the predefined threshold levels.\n- - SMFs and UK MRTs are subject to an additional non-financial metric based on a conduct assessment with a potential downward adjustment of up to 100% of the entire award.\n\n| Performance metric:  average RoCET1 (50% of award)   | Performance metric:  average RoCET1 (50% of award)   | Performance metric:  average RoCET1 (50% of award)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold (<8%)                                | Threshold (8%) up to maximum (<18%)                  | Maximum and above (>18%)                             |\n| Full forfeiture (payout 0%)                          | Partial vest (payout between 33% and <100%)          | Full vest (payout 100%)                              |\n\n| Performance metric:  rTSR vs G-SIBs index (50% of award)   | Performance metric:  rTSR vs G-SIBs index (50% of award)   | Performance metric:  rTSR vs G-SIBs index (50% of award)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Below threshold (<-25 pps)                                 | Threshold (-25 pps) up to  maximum (+25 pps)               | Maximum and above (>+25 pps)                               |\n| Full forfeiture (payout 0%)                                | Partial vest (payout between 33% and <100%)                | Full vest (payout 100%)                                    |\n\n- -the  index,  which  includes  publicly  traded  G-SIBs,  is  equal weighted, calculated in Swiss francs and maintained by an independent index provider, so as to ensure independence of the TSR calculation; and\n- -the payout interval of \u00b125 percentage points versus the index performance demonstrates our ambition of delivering attractive relative returns to shareholders.

For the 2021 performance year, we granted EOP awards to 4,228 employees.\n\nDelivering sustainable performance is a key objective for UBS, and  we  therefore  link  EOP  award  vesting  with  minimum performance thresholds over a multi-year time horizon. Our EOP creates a direct link with shareholder returns as a notional equity award and have no upward leverage. This approach promotes growth and sustainable performance.\n\nEOP  awards  generally  vest  over  three  years.  For  certain employee populations, EOP awards can be adjusted downwards, including  to  zero,  based  on  the  average  RoCET1  over  the applicable performance period. The Compensation Committee sets the minimum future performance threshold and may adjust the  award  if  the  performance  metric  does  not  reflect  a  fair measure of performance.\n\nAsset Management employees receive some or all of their EOP in the form of notional funds to align their compensation more closely with industry standards. This plan is generally delivered in cash and vests over five years.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Vesting of outstanding awards granted in prior years subject to performance conditions' in the 'Supplemental information' section of this report for more information\n\n## Deferred Contingent Capital Plan\n\nThe DCCP is a key component of our compensation framework and supports alignment of the interests of our senior employees with those of our stakeholders.\n\nAll employees subject to deferral requirements receive DCCP awards.  For  the  2021  performance  year,  we  granted  DCCP awards to 4,303 employees.\n\nDCCP  awards  vest  in  full  after  five  years  (longer  deferral periods may apply for regulated employees). DCCP awards bear notional interest paid annually (except as limited by regulation for MRTs), subject to review and confirmation by the Compensation Committee. The notional interest rate for grants in 2022 was 3.7% for awards denominated in Swiss francs and 5.7% for awards denominated in US dollars. These interest rates are based on the current market rates for similar AT1 capital instruments issued by UBS Group.\n\nAwards are forfeited if a viability event occurs, i.e., if FINMA notifies the firm that the DCCP awards must be written down to mitigate the risk of an insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS or if the firm receives a commitment of extraordinary support from the public sector that is necessary to prevent such an event. DCCP awards are also written down for GEB members if the Group's CET1 capital ratio falls below 10% and for all other employees if it falls below 7%.\n\nIn addition, GEB members forfeit 20% of DCCP awards for each loss-making year during the vesting period. This means 100% of the award is subject to risk of forfeiture. The forfeiture features of DCCP create a strong alignment with our debt holders and support the sustainability of the firm.\n\nOver the last five years, USD 1.7 billion of DCCP awards have been issued, contributing to the Group's total loss-absorbing capacity  (TLAC).  Therefore,  DCCP  awards  not  only  support competitive pay but also provide a loss absorption buffer that protects the firm's capital position. The following table illustrates the contribution of the DCCP to our AT1 capital and the effect on our TLAC ratio.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Supplemental information' section of this report for more information about performance award and personnelrelated expenses\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Supplemental information' section of this report for more information about longer vesting and clawback periods for MRTs and SMFs\n\nDCCP replicates many of the features of the loss-absorbing bonds that we issue to investors and may be paid at vesting in cash or, at the discretion of the firm, a perpetual, marketable additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instrument. Employees can elect to have their DCCP awards denominated in Swiss francs or US dollars.\n\n## Contribution of the Deferred Contingent Capital Plan to our loss-absorbing capacity 1\n\n| USD million, except where indicated                                                                        | 3 311..1122..2211   | 31.12.20   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|\n| Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (DCCP), eligible as high-trigger loss-absorbing additional tier 1 capital | 1 1,,773300         | 1,875      |\n| DCCP contribution to the total loss-absorbing capacity ratio (%)                                           | 00..66              | 0.6        |\n\n- 1 1 Refer to 'Bondholder information' at ubs.com/investors for more information about the capital instruments of UBS Group AG and UBS AG both on a consolidated and a standalone basis.",

        "page_content": "## Replacement awards and forfeitures\n\nIn line with industry practice, our compensation framework and plans include provisions generally requiring reduction / forfeiture of a terminated employee's unvested or deferred awards. In particular, these provisions apply if the terminated employee joins another financial services organization and / or violates restrictive covenants, such as solicitation of clients or employees.\n\nConversely, to support talent acquisition, and consistent with industry practice, we may offer replacement awards to attract senior  candidates  by  offsetting  deferred  compensation  being forfeited at their previous employer as a result of joining UBS. When  making  such  awards,  we  aim  to  match  the  previous employer's terms and conditions for the awards to be forfeited upon joining UBS. The total 2021 forfeitures of USD 258 million of previously awarded deferred compensation offset the 2021 total sign-on payments, replacement payments and guarantees of USD 137 million.\n\nBarbara Levi succeeded Markus Diethelm as Group General Counsel effective 1 November 2021. Consistent with the terms of the  original  awards  and  included  in  the  above  figures,  she received replacement awards for compensation forfeited at her previous  employer  as  a  result  of  joining  UBS.  Ms.  Levi's replacement payment had a total value of CHF 7,081,474 and consisted  of  an  EOP  share  award  representing  430,732  UBS shares (denominated in Swiss francs), a deferred cash award as well as replacement of cash items. The deferred portion of the award will vest in various installments between 2022 and 2027. These replacement awards are subject to UBS's harmful acts provisions.\n\n## Other variable compensation components\n\nTo support hiring and retention, particularly at senior levels, we may offer other compensation components, such as:\n\n- -retention payments to key employees to induce them to stay, particularly during critical periods for the firm, such as a sale or wind-down of a business;\n- -on a limited basis, guarantees may be required to attract individuals with certain skills and experience - these awards are fixed incentives subject to our standard deferral rules and limited to the first full year of employment;\n- -award grants to employees hired late in the year to replace performance awards that they would have earned at their previous employers, but have foregone by joining UBS - these awards are generally structured with the same level of deferral as for employees at a similar level at UBS; and\n- -in exceptional cases, candidates may be offered a sign-on award to increase the chances of them accepting our offer.\n\nThese other variable compensation components are subject to a comprehensive governance process, which may involve the Compensation Committee, depending on the amount or type of such payments.\n\nBelow-GEB level employees who are made redundant may receive severance payments. Our severance terms comply with the applicable  local  laws  (legally  obligated  severance).  In  certain locations, we  may  provide  severance  packages  that  are negotiated with our local social partners and may go beyond the applicable  minimum  legal  requirements  (standard  severance). Such  payments  are  governed  by  location-specific  severance policies. In addition, we may make severance payments that exceed legally obligated or standard severance payments where we believe these are aligned with market practice and appropriate under the circumstances (supplemental severance). GEB members do not receive severance payments.\n\n## Sign-on payments, replacement payments, guarantees and severance payments\n\n|                                                           | T Toottaall  22002211   | o off  wwhhiicchh::  nnoonn--ddeeffeerrrreedd   c caasshh   | of which: deferred  compensation  awards   | T Toottaall  22002200   | N Nuummbbeerr  ooff  bbeenneeffiicciiaarriieess   | N Nuummbbeerr  ooff  bbeenneeffiicciiaarriieess   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| USD million, except where indicated                       |                         |                                                             |                                            |                         | 2 2002211                                         | 2020                                              |\n| TToottaall  ssiiggnn--oonn  ppaayymmeennttss 1 1          | 2266                    | 1188                                                        | 8                                          | 20                      | 222266                                            | 99                                                |\n| of which: Key Risk Takers 2                               | 99                      | 44                                                          | 5                                          | 2                       | 66                                                | 3                                                 |\n| T Toottaall  rreeppllaacceemmeenntt  ppaayymmeennttss 3 3 | 9944                    | 1111                                                        | 83                                         | 58                      | 331100                                            | 200                                               |\n| of which: Key Risk Takers 2                               | 3344                    | 55                                                          | 29                                         | 17                      | 1122                                              | 13                                                |\n| T Toottaall  gguuaarraanntteeeess 3 3                     | 1177                    | 1111                                                        | 6                                          | 16                      | 4400                                              | 32                                                |\n| of which: Key Risk Takers 2                               | 22                      | 11                                                          | 1                                          | 5                       | 11                                                | 2                                                 |\n| T Toottaall  sseevveerraannccee  ppaayymmeennttss 1 1,,44 | 116600                  | 220000 5 5                                                  | 0                                          | 134                     | 11,,447777                                        | 1,019                                             |\n| of which: Key Risk Takers 2                               | 33                      | 00                                                          | 0                                          | 0                       | 1100                                              | 0                                                 |\n\n## Forfeitures 1\n\n|                                     | T Toottaall  22002211   | Total 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|\n| USD million, except where indicated |                         |              |\n| T Toottaall  ffoorrffeeiittuurreess | 225588                  | 145          |\n| of which: former GEB members        | 2233                    | 0            |\n| of which: Key Risk Takers 2         | 88                      | 6            |",

It also includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to vesting requirements. 4 4 Estimates as of 31 December 2021 and 2020. Actual amounts to be expensed in future periods may vary, e.g., due to forfeiture of awards. 5 5 Represents estimated post-vesting transfer restriction and permanent forfeiture discounts. 6 6 Included in expenses deferred to future periods is an amount of USD 121 million (2020: USD 74 million) in interest expense related to the Deferred Contingent Capital Plan.

Performance  award expenses for 2021 decreased 1% to USD 3.2 billion, reflecting increased performance award expenses accrued in the\n\nperformance  year,  offset  by  lower  expenses  related  to  prior performance years, as 2020 included additional expenses that resulted from modifying the terms of certain outstanding deferred compensation  awards.

Weber, the BoD determines, among other things, the strategy for the Group, based on recommendations by the Group CEO, exercises ultimate supervision over management and appoints all GEB members.\n\nThe Chairman leads all general meetings and BoD meetings and works with the committee chairpersons to coordinate their work. Together with the Group CEO, the Chairman is responsible for effective communication with shareholders and stakeholders, including  clients,  government  officials,  regulators  and  public organizations. The Chairman works closely with the Group CEO and other GEB members, providing advice and support when appropriate,  and  continues  to  strengthen  and  promote  our culture through the three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors.\n\nThe Chairman's total compensation for the period from AGM to AGM is contractually fixed without any variable component. For the current period from the 2021 AGM to the 2022 AGM, his total compensation was CHF 4.9 million, excluding benefits and pension fund contributions. The Chairman's total compensation\n\nfor the current period consisted of a cash payment of CHF 3.5 million and a share component of CHF 1.4 million consisting of 72,939  UBS  shares  at  CHF 19.194  per  share.  The  share component aligns the Chairman's pay with the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThus, Mr. Weber's total reward, including benefits and pension fund contributions, for his service as Chairman for the current period, was CHF 5,224,913.\n\nThe Chairman's employment agreement does not provide for severance terms or supplementary contributions to pension plans. The benefits for the Chairman are in line with local practices for UBS  employees.  The  Chairperson  of  the  Compensation Committee proposes and the Compensation Committee approves the Chairman's compensation annually for the upcoming AGMto-AGM period, taking into consideration fee or compensation levels for comparable roles based on our core financial industry peers and other relevant leading Swiss companies included in the Swiss Market Index.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Board of Directors' in the 'Corporate governance' section of our Annual Report 2021 for more information about the responsibilities of the Chairman\n\n## Audited |\n\n## Compensation details and additional information for non-independent BoD members\n\n| CHF, except where indicated   |                                                       |             |                       |                                                   |                    | USD (for reference)   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Name, function 1              | F Foorr  tthhee  ppeerriioodd   A AGGMM  ttoo  AAGGMM | Base salary | Annual share  award 2 | Contributions to retirement plans and  benefits 3 | T Toottaall 4 4    | Total 4,5             |\n| Axel A.

Independent BoD members  do  not  receive  performance  awards,  severance payments, benefits or pension contributions.\n\nIn the current period, the roles of Senior Independent Director and Vice Chairman are both held by one BoD member, but the additional fee is only paid once. Independent BoD members must use a minimum of 50% of their fees to purchase UBS shares, which are blocked for four years, and they may elect to use up to 100% of their fees to purchase blocked UBS shares. In all cases, the number of shares is calculated based on the average closing price of the 10 trading days leading up to and including the grant date.\n\nAt  each  AGM,  shareholders  are  invited  to  approve  the aggregate amount of BoD remuneration, including compensation for the Chairman, which applies until the next AGM. The tables below and on the following page provide details on the fee structure for the independent BoD members.\n\nThe fee structure for independent BoD members is reviewed annually based on the Chairman's proposal to the Compensation Committee, which in turn submits a proposal to the BoD for approval. In our regular review of the BoD fee structure, we concluded  that  our  overall  approach  for  independent  BoD member compensation remains appropriate and thus unchanged.\n\n## Remuneration framework for independent BoD members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CHF                                            | 2021 AGM to 2022 AGM   | 1       | Pay mix            | Delivery     | Delivery             |           |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------|--------------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Fixed base fee                                 | 300,000                | 300,000 |                    |              |                      |           |\n| Additional fees                                |                        |         | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n| Senior Independent Director / Vice Chairman    | 150,000                | 150,000 | shares             |              |                      | 50%       |\n| Additional committee fees                      | Chair                  | Member  | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n| Audit Committee                                | 300,000                | 200,000 | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n| Compensation Committee                         | 200,000                | 100,000 | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n| Governance and Nominating Committee            |                        | 100,000 | Cash               | Up to  50%   |                      | At  least |\n| Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee |                        | 50,000  | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n| Risk Committee                                 | 350,000                | 200,000 | Blocked            |              |                      | At  least |\n|                                                |                        |         | AGM- to-AGM period | grant   year | year 1 year 2 year 3 | year 4    |",

This includes employees that work in front-office roles, logistics and control functions. Identifying KRTs globally is part of our risk control framework and an important element in ensuring we incentivize only appropriate risk-taking.  For  2021,  in  addition  to  GEB  members,  699 employees  were  classified  as  KRTs  throughout  UBS  Group globally,  including  all  employees  with  a  total  compensation exceeding USD / CHF 2.5 million (Highly Paid Employees), who may not have been identified as KRTs during the performance year.\n\nIn  line  with  regulatory  requirements,  the  performance  of employees identified as KRTs during the performance year is evaluated by the control functions. In addition, KRTs' performance awards are subject to a mandatory deferral rate of at least 50%, regardless of whether the deferral threshold has been met (excluding KRTs with de minimis performance awards below a pre-determined threshold where standard deferral rates apply). A KRT's deferred compensation award will only vest if the Group performance conditions are met. Consistent with all other employees, the deferred portion of a KRT's compensation is also subject to forfeiture or reduction if the KRT commits harmful acts.\n\n## Fixed and variable compensation for Key Risk Takers 1\n\n|                                                                  | T Toottaall  ffoorr  22002211   | T Toottaall  ffoorr  22002211   | N Noott  ddeeffeerrrreedd   | N Noott  ddeeffeerrrreedd   | D Deeffeerrrreedd 2 2   | D Deeffeerrrreedd 2 2   | Total for 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|\n| USD million, except where indicated                              | A Ammoouunntt                   | % %                             | A Ammoouunntt               | % %                         | A Ammoouunntt           | % %                     | Amount           |\n| TToottaall  ccoommppeennssaattiioonn                             |                                 |                                 |                             |                             |                         |                         |                  |\n| Amount                                                           | 11,,556611                      | 110000                          | 889955                      | 5577                        | 666666                  | 4433                    | 1,400            |\n| Number of beneficiaries                                          | 669999                          |                                 |                             |                             |                         |                         | 647              |\n| F Fiixxeedd  ccoommppeennssaattiioonn 3 3,,44                    | 447777                          | 3311                            | 447777                      | 110000                      | 00                      | 00                      | 417              |\n| Cash-based                                                       | 447744                          | 3300                            | 447744                      |                             |                         |                         | 417              |\n| Equity-based                                                     | 33                              | 00                              | 33                          |                             |                         |                         | 1                |\n| V Vaarriiaabbllee  ccoommppeennssaattiioonn                      | 11,,008844                      | 6699                            | 441188                      | 3399                        | 666666                  | 6611                    | 983              |\n| Cash 5                                                           | 441188                          | 2277                            | 441188                      |                             |                         |                         | 365              |\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) / Equity Ownership  Plan (EOP) 6 | 442233                          | 2277                            |                             |                             | 442233                  |                         | 404              |\n| Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (DCCP) 6                        | 224433                          | 1166                            |                             |                             | 224433                  |                         | 213              |",

Year-to-year reconciliations would also need to consider the impacts of additional items including off-cycle awards, FX movements, population changes, and dividend equivalent reinvestments. 2 2 Refer to 'Note 28 Employee benefits: variable compensation' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of the Annual Report 2021 for more information. 3 3 GEB members and KRTs who are also MRTs do not receive dividend and interest payments. Accordingly, the amounts for the EOP / LTIP reflect the fair value of the non-dividend-bearing awards and for the DCCP the fair value of the granted non-interest-bearing awards. 4 4 Where applicable, amounts are translated into US dollars at the performance award currency exchange rate. LTIP values reflect the fair value awarded at grant. 5 5 Takes into account the ex-post implicit adjustments, given the share price movements since grant. Where applicable, amounts are translated from award currency into US dollars using FX rates as of 31 December 2021. LTIP values reflect the fair value awarded at grant. 6 6 Valued at distribution price and FX rate for all awards distributed in 2021.\n\nThe table below shows the value of actual ex-post explicit and implicit adjustments to outstanding deferred compensation in the 2021 financial year for GEB members and KRTs.\n\nEx-post adjustments occur after an award has been granted. Explicit  adjustments  occur  when  we  adjust  compensation  by forfeiting deferred awards. Implicit adjustments are unrelated to\n\nany action taken by the firm and occur as a result of price movements that affect the value of an award.\n\nThe total value of ex-post explicit adjustments made to UBS share awards in 2021, based on the approximately 8.1 million shares forfeited during 2021, is a reduction of USD 142 million.\n\n## GEB and KRTs ex-post explicit and implicit adjustments

2021 (which may differ from the expense recognized in the income statement in accordance with IFRS). The 2020 data is valued using the share price on 31 December 2020 (USD 14.13). For LTIP the forfeited units reflect the fair value awarded at grant. For the notional funds awarded to Asset Management employees under the EOP, this represents the forfeiture credits recognized in 2021 and 2020. For the DCCP, the fair value at grant of the forfeited awards during the year is reflected. 2 2 Ex-post implicit adjustments for UBS shares are calculated based on the difference between the weighted average grant date fair value and the share price at year-end. The amount for notional funds is calculated using the mark-to-market change during 2021 and 2020. For the GEB member who was appointed to the GEB during 2021, awards have been fully reflected in the GEB entries.",

        "page_content": "Advisory vote\n\nCorporate governance and compensation | Compensation\n\n## Material Risk Takers\n\nFor relevant EU- or UK-regulated entities, we identify individuals who are deemed to be Material Risks Takers (MRTs) based on local regulatory requirements, including the respective EU Commission Delegated  Regulation,  the  fifth  iteration  of  the  EU  Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and equivalent UK requirements, as applicable. This group consists of senior management, risk takers, selected staff in control or support functions and certain highly-compensated employees. For 2021, UBS identified 683 MRTs in relation to its relevant EU or UK entities.\n\nVariable  compensation  awarded  to  MRTs  is  subject  to additional  deferral  and  other  requirements.  These  include  a maximum variable to fixed compensation ratio of 200% based on approval through relevant shareholder votes, a minimum deferral rate of 40% or 60% (depending on role / variable compensation level) on performance awards and delivery of at least 50% of any upfront performance award in UBS shares that are vested but blocked for 12 months after grant.\n\nDeferred  awards  granted  to  MRTs  under  UBS's  deferred compensation plans for their performance in 2021 are subject to 6- or 12-month blocking periods post vesting and do not pay out dividends or interest during the deferral period.\n\nFor up to seven years after grant, performance awards granted to MRTs are subject to clawback provisions, which allow the firm to claim repayment of both the upfront and the vested deferred element of any performance award if an individual is found to have contributed substantially to significant financial losses for the Group or corporate structure in scope, a material downward restatement of disclosed results, or engaged in misconduct and / or failed to take expected actions that contributed to significant reputational harm.\n\nLTIP awards granted to UK MRTs and SMFs are subject to an additional non-financial conduct-related metric as required by UK regulation.\n\n## UK Senior Managers and Certification Regime\n\nThe Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) of the UK  Prudential  Regulation  Authority  and  Financial  Conduct Authority requires that individuals with specified responsibilities, performing certain significant functions and / or those in certain other identified categories be designated as SMFs.\n\nSubject  to  de  minimis  and  other  compensation-related considerations,  variable  compensation  awards  made  to  SMFs must comply with specific requirements, including longer deferral, blocking and clawback periods. The deferral period for SMFs is seven years, with the deferred performance awards vesting no faster than pro rata from years 3 to 7, except those who have total compensation below GBP 500,000 and variable incentive accounting for less than 33% of total compensation, for whom a five-year deferral period (instead of a seven-year period) applies. Such awards are also subject to a 12-month blocking period post vesting. The clawback policy for SMFs permits clawback for up to 10 years from the date of performance award grants (applicable if an individual is subject to an investigation at the end of the initial seven-year clawback period). All SMFs are also MRTs and, as such, subject to the same prohibitions on dividend and interest payments.\n\n## Control functions and Group Internal Audit\n\nOur control functions must be independent in order to monitor risk  effectively.  Therefore,  their  compensation  is  determined separately from the revenue areas that they oversee, supervise or monitor. Their performance award pool is based not on the performance of these businesses, but on the performance of the Group as a whole. We also consider other factors, such as how effectively the function has performed and our market position. Decisions on individual compensation for the senior managers of the  control  functions  are  made  by  the  function  heads  and approved by the Group CEO. Decisions on individual compensation for the members of Group Internal Audit (GIA) are made by the Head GIA and approved by the Chairman. Following a proposal by the Chairman, total compensation for the Head GIA is approved by the Compensation Committee.",

Variable compensation includes cash performance awards paid in 2022 for the 2021 performance year, amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in previous years and the cost of deferred awards granted  to  employees  that  are  eligible  for  retirement  in  the context of the compensation framework at the date of grant.\n\nThe performance award pool reflects the value of performance awards granted relating to the 2021 performance year, including awards that are paid out immediately and those that are deferred. To determine our variable compensation expenses, the following adjustments are required in order to reconcile the performance\n\naward pool to the expenses recognized in the Group's financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS:\n\n- -reduction for expenses deferred to future periods (amortization of unvested awards granted in 2022 for the 2021 performance year) and accounting adjustments; and\n- -addition for 2021 amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in prior years.\n\nAs a large part of compensation consists of deferred awards, the amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in prior years forms a significant part of the IFRS expenses in both 2021 and 2022.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 6 Personnel expenses' and 'Note 28 Employee benefits: variable

        "page_content": "## Provisions of the Articles of Association related to compensation\n\nSwiss say-on-pay provisions give shareholders of companies listed in Switzerland significant influence over board and management compensation. At UBS, this is achieved by means of an annual binding say-on-pay vote in accordance with the following provisions of the Articles of Association (the AoA).\n\n## Say on pay\n\nIn line with article 43 of the AoA of UBS Group AG, the General Meeting approves proposals from the BoD in relation to: a) the maximum aggregate amount of compensation of the BoD for the period until the next AGM;\n\nb) the maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation of the GEB for the following financial year; and c) the aggregate amount of variable compensation of the GEB for the preceding financial year.\n\nThe BoD may submit for approval by the General Meeting deviating or additional proposals relating to the same or different periods. If the General Meeting does not approve a proposal from the BoD, the BoD will determine, taking into account all relevant factors, the respective (maximum) aggregate amount or (maximum) partial amounts and submit the amount(s) so determined for approval by the General Meeting. UBS Group AG or companies controlled by it may pay or grant compensation prior to approval by the General Meeting, subject to subsequent approval.\n\n## Principles of compensation\n\nIn line with articles 45 and 46 of the AoA of UBS Group AG, compensation of the members of the BoD includes base remuneration and may include other compensation elements and benefits. Compensation of the members of the BoD is intended to recognize the responsibility and governance nature of their role, to attract and retain qualified individuals, and to ensure alignment with shareholders' interests.\n\nCompensation of the members of the GEB includes fixed and variable compensation elements. Fixed compensation includes the base salary and may include other compensation elements and benefits. Variable compensation elements are governed by financial and non-financial performance measures that take into account the performance of UBS Group AG and / or parts thereof, targets in relation to the market, other companies or comparable benchmarks, short- and long-term strategic objectives, and / or individual targets. The BoD or, where delegated to it, the Compensation Committee determines the respective performance measures, the overall and individual performance targets, and their achievement. The BoD or, where delegated to it, the Compensation Committee aims to ensure alignment with sustainable performance and appropriate risk-taking through adequate deferrals, forfeiture conditions, caps on\n\ncompensation, harmful acts provisions and similar means with regard to parts of or all of the compensation. Parts of variable compensation are subject to a multi-year vesting period.\n\nAdditional amount for GEB members appointed after the vote on the aggregate amount of compensation by the AGM\n\nIn line with article 46 of the AoA of UBS Group AG, if the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved by the General Meeting is not sufficient to also cover the compensation of a person who becomes a member of or is being promoted within the GEB after the General Meeting has approved the compensation, UBS Group AG, or companies controlled by it, is authorized to pay or grant each such GEB member a supplementary amount during the compensation period(s) already approved. The aggregate pool for such supplementary amounts per compensation period cannot exceed 40% of the average of total annual compensation paid or granted to the GEB during the previous three years.\n\n- \u203a Refer to ubs.com/governance for more information",

The audit was limited to the information according to articles 14 - 16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation in Stock Exchange Listed Companies (Ordinance) contained in the following tables labeled 'audited' of the compensation report: Approved fixed compensation, Total compensation for GEB members,  Compensation  details  and  additional  information  for  non-independent  BoD  members,  Total payments to BoD members, Remuneration details and additional information for independent BoD members, Loans granted to GEB members, Loans granted to BoD members and Compensation paid to former BoD and GEB members .\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibility\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and overall fair presentation of the compensation report in accordance with Swiss law and the Ordinance. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the compensation report. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the compensation report complies with Swiss law and articles 14 - 16 of the Ordinance.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence on the disclosures made in the compensation report with regard to compensation, loans and credits in accordance with articles 14 - 16 of the Ordinance. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatements in the compensation report, whether due to fraud or error. This audit also includes evaluating the reasonableness of the methods applied to value components of compensation, as well as assessing the overall presentation of the compensation report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the compensation report for the year ended 31 December 2021 of UBS Group AG complies with Swiss law and articles 14 - 16 of the Ordinance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Ltd\n\nMaurice McCormick Licensed audit expert (Auditor in charge)\n\nJan Marxfeld Licensed audit expert",

In our opinion, UBS Group AG and subsidiaries ('the Group') maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Group as of 31 December 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021, and the related notes and our report dated 4 March 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  in  the  accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Ltd Basel, 4 March 2022",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group at 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2021, in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Group's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated 4 March 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's Board of Directors. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.",

We also independently challenged key judgments in relation to a sample of fair value adjustments.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosures regarding fair value measurement (within Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's deferred tax assets ('DTA') were USD 8,876 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). DTAs are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which, the deductible  temporary differences or the carryforward of unused tax losses within the loss carryforward period can be utilized. There is significant judgment exercised when estimating future taxable income that is not based on the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Management's estimate of\n\nAt 31 December 2021, as explained in Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group held financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value of USD 345,010 million and USD 300,916 million, including financial instruments that did not trade in active markets. These instruments are reported within the following accounts: financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading, derivative financial instruments, financial assets at fair value not held for trading, debt issued designated at fair value, and other financial liabilities designated at fair value. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the Group used valuation techniques, modelling assumptions, and estimates of unobservable market inputs which required significant management judgment.\n\nAuditing management's judgments and assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of these instruments was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of valuation techniques, key modelling assumptions and significant unobservable inputs. Auditing the valuation of complex or illiquid instruments at fair value included consideration of any incremental risks arising from the impact of the current economic environment on valuation techniques and inputs. The valuation techniques that required especially complex judgement were comprised of  discounted  cash  flow  and  earnings-based  valuation  techniques.  Highly  judgmental modelling assumptions result from a range of different models or model calibrations used by market participants. Valuation inputs which were particularly complex and subjective included those with a limited degree of observability and the extrapolation, interpolation or calibration of curves using limited and proxy data points. Examples of such inputs included unobservable credit spreads and bond prices, volatility, and correlation.",

Estimating future profitability is inherently subjective as it is sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict. Specifically, some of the more subjective key macro-economic assumptions used included gross  domestic  product  growth  rates,  equity  market  performance,  and  interest  rate expectations.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls over DTA valuation, which included the assumptions used in developing the strategic plans and estimating future taxable income.\n\nWe assessed the completeness and accuracy of the data used for the estimations of future taxable income. This included recalculating the outputs of models applied to the recognition process for DTAs.\n\nWe involved specialists to assist in assessing the key economic assumptions embedded in the strategic plans. We compared key assumptions used to forecast future taxable income to externally available historical and prospective data and assumptions, and assessed the sensitivity of the outcomes using reasonably possible changes in assumptions.\n\nWe  also  assessed  management's  disclosure  regarding  recognized  and  unrecognized deferred tax assets (within Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Legal provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters (legal provisions) were USD 2,798 million. As explained in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that is exposed to significant litigation and similar risks arising from disputes and regulatory proceedings. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes may be difficult to predict. These uncertainties inherently affect the amount and timing of potential outflows with respect to the legal provisions which have been established and contingent liabilities.\n\nAuditing management's assessment of legal provisions and contingent liabilities was complex and judgmental due to the significant subjectivity involved in management's estimate of the amount and probability that an outflow of resources will be required for existing legal matters, including a material matter related to the cross-border wealth management business (Note 18b.1). In particular, these legal provisions are based on management's estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.",

Our procedures included testing management's review of the accuracy of the inputs to the estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWhere appropriate, we assessed the methodologies on which the provision amounts were based  with  the  involvement  of  specialists,  recalculated  the  provisions  and  tested  the underlying information. We inspected internal and external legal analyses of the matters supporting  the  judgmental  aspects  impacted  by  legal  interpretations.  We  obtained correspondence directly from external legal counsel to assess the information provided by management and performed inquiries with external counsel as necessary.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding legal provisions and contingent liabilities (within Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nDescription of the Matter\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's allowances and provisions for expected credit losses ('ECL') were USD 1,165 million. As explained in Notes 1, 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, ECL is recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income,  fee  and  lease receivables, financial guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments. ECL is also recognized on the undrawn portion of revolving revocable credit lines, which include the Group's credit card limits and master credit facilities. The allowances and provisions for ECL consists of exposures that are in default which are individually evaluated for impairment (stage 3), as well as losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (stage 1 and stage 2). Management's ECL estimates represent the difference between contractual cash flows and those the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate. The method used to calculate ECL is based on a combination of the following principal factors: probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the allowances and provisions for ECL was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of forward-looking economic scenarios that form the basis of the ECL calculation, their probability weightings, and the credit risk models used to estimate stage 1 and stage 2 ECL. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the complexity with its continuing impact on the economic environment in 2021. As a result, ECL estimation requires higher  management  judgement,  specifically  within  the  following  two  areas:  (i)  scenario selection, including assumptions about the scenario severity, the form and shape of the recovery pattern, and the number of scenarios necessary to sufficiently cover the bandwidth of potential outcomes, as well as related scenario weights and post-model adjustments; and, (ii) credit risk models, since the output from historic data based models may not be indicative of current or future conditions.\n\nAdditionally, auditing the measurement of individual ECL for stage 3 was complex due to the high degree of judgment involved in management's process for estimating ECL based on assumptions. These assumptions take into account expected future cash flows from collateral and  other  credit  enhancements  or  expected  payouts  from  bankruptcy  proceedings  for",

We evaluated management's methodologies and governance controls for developing and monitoring the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings assigned to them, and related post-model adjustment. Supported by specialists, we assessed the key macroeconomic variables used in the forward-looking scenarios, such as real gross domestic product growth, unemployment rate, interest rates and house price indices, and evaluated the modelled correlation and translation of those macroeconomic factors to the ECL estimate.  We  further  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  post-model  adjustments by considering management's governance process, assumptions used and sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe  also obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness of controls over credit risk models used in the ECL estimate, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of model input data, calculation logic, and output data used in the overall ECL calculation. With the support of specialists, on a sample basis, we performed  an  evaluation  of  management's  models  and  tested  the  model  outcomes  by inspecting model documentation, reperforming model calculations, and comparing data used as inputs to management's forecast to external sources, among other procedures.\n\nFor the measurement of stage 3, we obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process, including an evaluation of the assumptions used by management regarding the future cash flows from debtors' continuing operations and/or the liquidation of collateral. Supported by specialists in certain areas, we additionally tested collateral valuation, cash flow assumptions and exit strategies by performing inquiries of management, inspecting underlying documents, such as loan contracts, financial statements, covenants, budgets and business plans, and by reperforming discounted cash flow calculations among other procedures, on a sample basis .\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosures regarding financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement (within Notes 1, 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ernst & Young Ltd\n\nWe have served as the Group's auditor since 1998.\n\nBasel, Switzerland\n\n4 March 2022",

These instruments are reported within the following accounts: financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading, derivative financial instruments, financial assets at fair value not held for trading, debt issued designated at fair value, and other financial liabilities designated at fair value. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the Group used valuation techniques, modelling assumptions, and estimates of unobservable market inputs which required significant management judgment.\n\nAuditing management's judgments and assumptions used in the estimation of the fair value of  these  instruments  was  complex  due  to  the  highly  judgmental  nature  of  valuation techniques, key modelling assumptions and significant unobservable inputs. Auditing the valuation of complex or illiquid instruments at fair value included consideration of any incremental risks arising from the impact of the current economic environment on valuation techniques  and  inputs.  The  valuation  techniques  that  required  especially  complex judgement  were  comprised  of  discounted  cash  flow  and  earnings-based  valuation techniques. Highly judgmental modelling assumptions result from a range of different models or model calibrations used by market participants. Valuation inputs which were particularly complex and subjective included those with a limited degree of observability and the extrapolation, interpolation or calibration of curves using limited and proxy data points. Examples of such inputs included unobservable credit spreads and bond prices, volatility, and correlation.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness of the controls over management's financial instruments valuation processes, including controls over market data inputs, model and methodology governance, and valuation adjustments.\n\nWe tested the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and the inputs used in those models, as outlined above, by performing an independent revaluation of certain complex or illiquid financial assets and liabilities with the support of specialists, using independent models and inputs, and comparing inputs to available market data among other procedures. We also independently challenged key judgments in relation to a sample of fair value adjustments.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosures regarding fair value measurement (within Notes 1 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Recognition of deferred tax assets\n\nArea of focus\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's deferred tax assets ('DTA') were USD 8,876 million (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). DTAs are recognized to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available, against which, the deductible temporary differences or the carryforward of unused tax losses within the loss carryforward period can be utilized. There is significant judgment exercised when estimating future taxable income that is not based on the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Management's",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOur audit response\n\nestimate of future taxable profits is based on its strategic plan that is sensitive to the assumptions made in estimating future taxable income.\n\nAuditing management's assessment of the realizability of the Group's DTAs was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of estimating future taxable profits over the life of the underlying tax loss carryforwards. Estimating future profitability is inherently subjective as it is sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which are difficult to predict. Specifically, some of the more subjective key macro-economic assumptions used included gross  domestic  product  growth  rates,  equity  market  performance,  and  interest  rate expectations.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design,  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness  of  management's  controls  over  DTA  valuation,  which  included  the assumptions used in developing the strategic plans and estimating future taxable income.\n\nWe assessed the completeness and accuracy of the data used for the estimations of future taxable income. This included recalculating the outputs of models applied to the recognition process for DTAs.\n\nWe involved specialists to assist in assessing the key economic assumptions embedded in the strategic plans. We compared key assumptions used to forecast future taxable income to externally available historical and prospective data and assumptions, and assessed  the  sensitivity  of  the  outcomes  using  reasonably  possible  changes  in assumptions.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding recognized and unrecognized deferred tax assets (within Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Legal provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nArea of focus\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters (legal provisions) were USD 2,798 million. As explained in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that is exposed to significant litigation and similar risks arising from disputes and regulatory proceedings. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes may be difficult to predict. These uncertainties inherently affect the amount and timing of potential outflows with respect to the legal provisions which have been established and contingent liabilities.\n\nAuditing management's assessment of legal provisions and contingent liabilities was complex and judgmental due to the significant subjectivity involved in management's estimate of the amount and probability that an outflow of resources will be required for existing legal matters, including a material matter related to the cross-border wealth management business (Note 18b.1). In particular, these legal provisions are based on management's estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.",

Our procedures included testing management's review of the accuracy of the inputs to the estimation of the amount and likelihood of the occurrence of certain scenarios.\n\nWhere appropriate, we assessed the methodologies on which the provision amounts were based with the involvement of specialists, recalculated the provisions and tested the underlying information. We inspected internal and external legal analyses of the matters supporting  the  judgmental  aspects  impacted  by  legal  interpretations.  We  obtained correspondence directly from external legal counsel to assess the information provided by management and performed inquiries with external counsel as necessary.\n\nWe also assessed management's disclosure regarding legal provisions and contingent liabilities (within Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nArea of focus\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's allowances and provisions for expected credit losses ('ECL') were USD 1,165 million. As explained in Notes 1, 9 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements, ECL is recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, fee and lease receivables,  financial  guarantees  and  irrevocable  loan  commitments.  ECL  is  also recognized on the undrawn portion of revolving revocable credit lines, which include the Group's credit card limits and master credit facilities. The allowances and provisions for ECL  consists  of  exposures  that  are  in  default  which  are  individually  evaluated  for impairment (stage 3), as well as losses inherent in the loan portfolio that are not specifically identified (stage 1 and stage 2). Management's ECL estimates represent the difference between contractual cash flows and those the Group expects to receive, discounted at the effective interest rate. The method used to calculate ECL is based on a combination of the following principal factors: probability of default ('PD'), loss given default ('LGD') and exposure at default ('EAD').\n\nAuditing management's estimate of the allowances and provisions for ECL was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of forward-looking economic scenarios that form the basis of the ECL calculation, their probability weightings, and the credit risk models used to estimate stage 1 and stage 2 ECL. The COVID-19 pandemic also contributed to the complexity with its continuing impact on the economic environment in 2021. As a result, ECL estimation requires higher management judgement, specifically within the following two areas: (i) scenario selection, including assumptions about the scenario severity, the form and shape of the recovery pattern, and the number of scenarios necessary to sufficiently cover the bandwidth of potential outcomes, as well as related scenario weights and post-model adjustments; and, (ii) credit risk models, since the output from historic data based models may not be indicative of current or future conditions.\n\nAdditionally, auditing the measurement of individual ECL for stage 3 was complex due to the high degree of judgment involved in management's process for estimating ECL based on assumptions. These assumptions take into account expected future cash flows from collateral  and  other  credit  enhancements  or  expected  payouts  from  bankruptcy",

We evaluated management's methodologies and governance controls for developing and monitoring the economic scenarios used and the probability weightings assigned to them, and related post-model adjustment.

The Group continues to invest in its IT systems and is dependent on such technologies to meet client needs and business requirements, including the effectiveness of its IT general controls ('ITGCs') relevant to IT logical access and change management.\n\nAuditing management's ITGCs relevant to IT logical access and change management was complex as the Group is a multi-location organization with a significant number of IT infrastructure and applications relevant to financial reporting.",

acquired and disposed of by the Investment Bank in its capacity as a market-maker with regard to UBS shares and related derivatives, and to hedge certain issued structured debt instruments. These acquisitions and disposals are reported based on the sum of the net monthly movements. 3 3 Reflects the payment of an ordinary cash dividend of USD 0.37 (2020: USD 0.73, 2019: CHF 0.70) per dividend-bearing share. From 2020 onward, Swiss tax law effective 1 January 2020 requires that Switzerland-domiciled companies with shares listed on a stock exchange pay no more than 50% of dividends from capital contribution reserves, with the remainder required to be paid from retained earnings. 4 4 Mainly relates to the establishment of a banking partnership with Banco do Brasil. In 2020, UBS issued a 49.99% stake in UBS Brasil Servi\u00e7os in exchange for exclusive access to Banco do Brasil's corporate clients. Upon completion of the transaction in 2020, equity attributable to non-controlling interests increased by USD 115 million, with no material effect on equity attributable to shareholders. 5 5 Reflects the cancellation of 156,632,400 shares purchased under UBS's 2018-2021 share repurchase program as approved by shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. For shares repurchased from 2020 onward, Swiss tax law effective 1 January 2020 requires Switzerland-domiciled companies with shares listed on a Swiss stock exchange to reduce capital contribution reserves by at least 50% of the total capital reduction amount exceeding the nominal value upon cancellation of the shares. 6 6 Includes the effects related to the launch of UBS's new operational partnership entity with Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc.

2018-2021 share repurchase program as approved by shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. 2 2 The weighted average shares outstanding for basic EPS are calculated by taking the number of shares at the beginning of the period, adjusted by the number of shares acquired or issued during the period, multiplied by a time-weighted factor for the period outstanding. As a result, balances are affected by the timing of acquisitions and issuances during the period. 3 3 The weighted average number of shares for notional employee awards with performance conditions reflects all potentially dilutive shares that are expected to vest under the terms of the awards. 4 4 Reflects potential shares that could dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not dilutive for the periods presented.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\n## a) Material accounting policies\n\nThis Note describes the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements (the Financial Statements) of UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries (UBS or the Group). On 24 February 2022, the Financial Statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the IASB), and are presented in US dollars (USD).\n\nDisclosures marked as audited in the 'Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report form an integral part of the Financial Statements. These disclosures relate to requirements under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures , and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , and are not repeated in this section.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  described  in  this  Note  have  been applied consistently in all years presented unless otherwise stated in Note 1b.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nPreparation of these Financial Statements under IFRS requires management to apply judgment and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expenses  and  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities, and may involve significant uncertainty at the time they are made. Such estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information. UBS  regularly  reassesses  such  estimates  and assumptions, which encompass historical experience, expectations of the future and other pertinent factors, to determine their continuing relevance based on current conditions, updating them as necessary. Changes in those estimates and assumptions may have a significant effect on the Financial Statements. Furthermore, actual results may differ significantly from UBS's estimates, which could result in significant losses to the Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for.\n\nThe following areas contain estimation uncertainty or require critical judgment and have a significant effect on amounts recognized in the Financial Statements:\n\n- -expected credit loss measurement (refer to item 2g in this Note and to Note 20);\n- -fair value measurement (refer to item 2f in this Note and to Note 21);\n- -income taxes (refer to item 6 in this Note and to Note 8);\n- -provisions and contingent liabilities (refer to item 9 in this Note and to Note 18);\n- -post-employment benefit plans (refer to item 5 in this Note and to Note 27);\n- -goodwill (refer to item 8 in this Note and to Note 13); and\n- -consolidation of structured entities (refer to item 1 in this Note and to Note 29).\n\n## 1) Consolidation\n\nThe Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company (UBS Group AG) and its subsidiaries, presented as  a  single  economic  entity;  intercompany  transactions  and balances have been eliminated. UBS consolidates all entities that it controls, including structured entities (SEs), which is the case when it has: (i) power over the relevant activities of the entity; (ii) exposure to an entity's variable returns; and (iii) the ability to use its power to affect its own returns.\n\nConsideration  is  given  to  all  facts  and  circumstances  to determine whether the Group has power over another entity, i.e., the current ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity when decisions about those activities need to be made.\n\nSubsidiaries, including SEs, are consolidated from the date when control is gained and deconsolidated from the date when control ceases. Control, or the lack thereof, is reassessed if facts and circumstances indicate that there is a change to one or more elements required to establish that control is present.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The amount of any non-controlling interest is measured at  the  non-controlling  interest's  proportionate  share  of  the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 29 for more information\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nEach  individual  entity  is  assessed  for  consolidation  in  line  with  the aforementioned consolidation principles. The assessment of control can be complex and requires the use of significant judgment, in particular in determining whether UBS has power over the entity. As the nature and extent of UBS's involvement is unique for each entity, there is no uniform consolidation outcome by entity. Certain entities within a class may be consolidated while others may not. When carrying out the consolidation assessment, judgment is exercised considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the nature and activities of the investee, as well as the substance of voting and similar rights.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 29 for more information",

        "page_content": "## 2) Financial instruments\n\n## a. Recognition\n\nUBS recognizes financial instruments when it becomes a party to contractual provisions of an instrument. UBS applies settlement date accounting to all standard purchases and sales of nonderivative financial instruments.\n\nIn transactions where UBS acts as a transferee, to the extent the financial asset transfer does not qualify for derecognition by the transferor, UBS does not recognize the transferred instrument as its asset.\n\nUBS also acts in a fiduciary capacity, which results in it holding or  placing  assets  on  behalf  of  individuals,  trusts,  retirement benefit plans and other institutions. Unless these items meet the definition of an asset and the recognition criteria are satisfied, they are not recognized on UBS's balance sheet and the related income is excluded from the Financial Statements.\n\nClient cash balances associated with derivatives clearing and execution services are not recognized on the balance sheet if, through  contractual  agreement,  regulation  or  practice,  UBS neither obtains benefits from nor controls such cash balances.\n\n## b. Classification, measurement and presentation\n\n## Financial assets\n\nAll financial instruments are on initial recognition measured at fair value and classified as measured at amortized cost, fair value through  other  comprehensive  income  (FVOCI)  or  fair  value through  profit  or  loss  (FVTPL).  For  financial  instruments subsequently measured at amortized cost or FVOCI, the initial fair value is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nWhere the contractual terms of a debt instrument result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the  principal  amount  outstanding,  the  debt  instrument  is classified as measured at amortized cost if it is held within a business model that has an objective of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, or at FVOCI if it is held within a business  model  with  the  objective  being  achieved  by  both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.\n\nAll other financial assets are measured at FVTPL, including those held for trading or those managed on a fair value basis, except for derivatives designated in a hedge relationship, in which case hedge accounting requirements apply (refer to item 2j in this Note for more information).\n\nBusiness model assessment and contractual cash flow characteristics\n\nUBS determines the nature of a business model by considering the way financial assets are managed to achieve a particular business objective.\n\nIn  assessing  whether  contractual  cash  flows  are  SPPI,  the Group considers whether the contractual terms of the financial asset contain a term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows arising over the life of the instrument.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nDebt  issued  measured  at  amortized  cost  includes  contingent capital instruments containing contractual provisions under which the principal amounts would be written down or converted into equity upon either a specified common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio breach  or  a  determination  by  the  Swiss  Financial  Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) that a viability event has occurred. Such contractual provisions are not derivatives, as the underlying is deemed to be a non-financial variable specific to a party to the contract.\n\nIf a debt were to be written down or converted into equity in a future period, it would be partially or fully derecognized, with the difference between its carrying amount and the fair value of any equity issued recognized in the income statement.\n\nA gain or loss is recognized in Other income when debt issued is subsequently repurchased for market-making or other activities. A subsequent sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss UBS  designates  certain  issued  debt  instruments  as  financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, on the basis that such financial instruments include embedded derivatives and / or are managed on a fair value basis (refer to the table below for more information),  in  which  case  bifurcation  of  the  embedded derivative  component  is  not  required.  Financial  instruments including embedded derivatives arise predominantly from the issuance of certain structured debt instruments.\n\n## Measurement and presentation\n\nAfter initial recognition, UBS classifies, measures and presents its financial  assets  and  liabilities  in  accordance  with  IFRS  9,  as described in the table on the following pages.",

        "page_content": "## c. Loan commitments and financial guarantees\n\nLoan commitments are arrangements to provide credit under defined terms and conditions. Irrevocable loan commitments are classified as: (i) derivative loan commitments measured at fair value through profit or loss; (ii) loan commitments designated at fair value through profit or loss; or (iii) loan commitments not measured at fair value. Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require UBS to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for an incurred loss because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a specified debt instrument.\n\n## d. Interest income and expense\n\nInterest  income  and  expense  are  recognized  in  the  income statement  based  on  the  effective  interest  method.  When calculating  the  effective  interest  rate  (the  EIR)  for  financial instruments (other than credit-impaired financial instruments), UBS estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the instrument, but not expected credit losses, with the EIR applied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortized cost of a financial liability. However, when a financial asset becomes credit-impaired after initial recognition, interest income is determined by applying the EIR to the amortized cost of the  instrument,  which  represents  the  gross  carrying  amount adjusted for any credit loss allowance.\n\nUpfront  fees,  including  fees  on  loan  commitments  not measured at fair value where a loan is expected to be issued, and direct costs are included within the initial measurement of a financial instrument measured at amortized cost or FVOCI and recognized over the expected life of the instrument as part of its EIR.\n\nFees related to loan commitments where no loan is expected to be issued, as well as loan syndication fees where UBS does not retain a portion of the syndicated loan or where UBS does retain a portion of the syndicated loan at the same effective yield for comparable risk as other participants, are included in Net fee and commission income and either recognized over the life of the commitment or when syndication occurs.\n\n## \u203a Refer to item 3 in this Note for more information\n\nInterest income on financial assets, excluding derivatives, is included in interest income when positive and in interest expense when negative. Similarly, interest expense on financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, is included in interest expense, except when interest rates are negative, in which case it is included in interest income.\n\n- \u203a Refer to item 2b in this Note and Note 3 for more information\n\n## e. Derecognition\n\n## Financial assets\n\nUBS derecognizes a transferred financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, if the purchaser has received substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or a significant part of the risks and rewards combined with a practical ability to sell or pledge the asset.\n\nWhere financial assets have been pledged as collateral or in similar arrangements,  they  are  considered  to  have  been transferred if the counterparty has received the contractual rights to the cash flows of the pledged assets, as may be evidenced by, for example, the counterparty's right to sell or repledge the assets. In transfers where control over the financial asset is retained, UBS continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined by the extent to which it is exposed to changes  in  the  value  of  the  transferred  asset  following  the transfer.\n\nCertain OTC derivative contracts and most exchange-traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing counterparties and exchanges are considered to be settled on a daily basis, as the payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis represents legal or economic settlement, which results in derecognition of the associated derivatives.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 22 and Note 23 for more information\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nUBS derecognizes a financial liability when it is extinguished, i.e., when  the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is  discharged, canceled  or  expires.  When  an  existing  financial  liability  is exchanged for a new one from the same lender on substantially different  terms,  or  the  terms  of  an  existing  liability  are substantially modified, the original liability is derecognized and a new liability recognized with any difference in the respective carrying amounts recognized in the income statement.\n\n## f. Fair value of financial instruments\n\nUBS accounts for a significant portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price on the measurement date that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or in the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 21 for more information",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe use of valuation techniques, modeling assumptions and estimates of unobservable market inputs in the fair valuation of financial instruments requires significant judgment and could affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Valuation techniques that rely more heavily on unobservable inputs and sophisticated models inherently require a higher level of judgment and may require adjustment to reflect factors that market participants would consider in estimating fair value, such as close-out costs, which are presented in Note 21d.\n\nUBS's governance framework over fair value measurement is described in Note 21b, and UBS provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated effects arising from changing significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 financial instruments to reasonably possible alternative assumptions in Note 21g.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 21 for more information\n\n## g. Allowances and provisions for expected credit losses\n\nECL are recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost,  financial  assets  measured  at  FVOCI,  fee  and  lease receivables,  financial  guarantees,  and  loan  commitments  not measured at fair value. ECL are also recognized on the undrawn portion  of  committed  unconditionally  revocable  credit  lines, which include UBS's credit card limits and master credit facilities, as UBS is exposed to credit risk because the borrower has the ability  to  draw  down  funds  before  UBS  can  take  credit  risk mitigation actions.\n\n## Recognition of expected credit losses\n\nECL are recognized on the following basis:\n\n- -Stage 1 instruments: Maximum 12-month ECL are recognized from initial recognition, reflecting the portion of lifetime cash shortfalls that would result if a default occurs in the 12 months after the reporting date, weighted by the risk of a default occurring.\n- -Stage 2  instruments:  Lifetime  ECL  are  recognized  if  a significant  increase  in  credit  risk  (an  SICR)  is  observed subsequent to the instrument's initial recognition, reflecting lifetime  cash  shortfalls  that  would  result  from  all  possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument, weighted by the risk of a default occurring. When an SICR is no longer observed, the instrument will move back to stage 1.\n- -Stage 3 instruments: Lifetime ECL are always recognized for credit-impaired financial instruments, as determined by the occurrence of one or more loss events, by estimating expected cash  flows  based  on  a  chosen  recovery  strategy.  Creditimpaired  exposures  may  include  positions  for  which  no allowance has been recognized, for example because they are expected to be fully recoverable through collateral held.\n- -Changes  in  lifetime  ECL  since  initial  recognition  are  also recognized for assets that are purchased or originated creditimpaired (POCI). POCI financial instruments include those that are purchased at a deep discount or newly originated with a defaulted counterparty; they remain a separate category until derecognition.\n\nAll or part of a financial asset is written off if it is deemed uncollectible or forgiven. Write-offs reduce the principal amount of a claim and are charged against related allowances for credit losses. Recoveries, in part or in full, of amounts previously written off are generally credited to Credit loss (expense) / release .\n\nECL are recognized in the income statement in Credit loss (expense) / release . A corresponding ECL allowance is reported as a decrease in the carrying amount of financial assets measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. For financial assets that are measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not reduced, but an accumulated  amount  is  recognized  in Other  comprehensive income . For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines, provisions for ECL are presented in Provisions.\n\n## Default and credit impairment\n\nUBS  applies  a  single  definition  of  default  for  credit  risk management purposes, regulatory reporting and ECL, with a counterparty classified as defaulted based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Credit policies for distressed assets' in the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Measurement of expected credit losses\n\nIFRS 9 ECL reflect an unbiased, probability-weighted estimate based on loss expectations resulting from default events. The method used to calculate ECL applies the following principal factors: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Parameters are generally determined on an individual financial asset level. Based on the materiality of the portfolio, for credit card exposures and personal account overdrafts in Switzerland, a portfolio approach is applied that derives an average PD and LGD for the entire portfolio. PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation are point-in-time (PIT)-based for key portfolios and consider both current conditions and expected cyclical  changes.  For  material  portfolios,  PDs  and  LGDs  are determined for different scenarios, whereas EAD projections are treated as scenario independent.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the ECL-relevant parameters, UBS leverages its Pillar 1 internal ratings-based (IRB) models that are also used in determining expected loss (EL) and risk-weighted assets  under  the  Basel III  framework  and  Pillar 2  stress  loss models. Adjustments have been made to these models and IFRS 9-related  models  have  been  developed  that  consider  the complexity, structure and risk profile of relevant portfolios and take account of the fact that PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation  are  PIT-based,  as  opposed  to  the  corresponding Basel III through-the-cycle (TTC) parameters. All models that are relevant for measuring expected credit losses are subject to UBS's model validation and oversight processes.",

PIT PDs are derived from TTC PDs and scenario forecasts. The modeling is region-, industry- and client  segment-specific  and  considers  both  macroeconomic scenario dependencies and client-idiosyncratic information.\n\nExposure  at  default: EAD  represents  an  estimate  of  the exposure to credit risk at the time of a potential default occurring, considering expected repayments, interest payments  and accruals, discounted at the EIR. Future drawdowns on facilities are considered through a credit conversion factor (a CCF) that is reflective of historical drawdown and default patterns and the characteristics of the respective portfolios.\n\nLoss given default: LGD represents an estimate of the loss at the time of a potential default occurring, taking into account expected future cash flows from collateral and other credit enhancements, or expected  payouts  from  bankruptcy  proceedings  for  unsecured claims and, where applicable, time to realization of collateral and the seniority of claims. LGD is commonly expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Estimation of expected credit losses\n\n## Number of scenarios and estimation of scenario weights\n\nDetermination of probability-weighted ECL requires evaluating a range  of  diverse  and  relevant  future  economic  conditions, especially  with  a  view  to  modeling  the  non-linear  effect  of assumptions about macroeconomic factors on the estimate.\n\nTo  accommodate  this  requirement,  UBS  uses  different economic  scenarios  in  the  ECL  calculation.  Each  scenario  is represented by a specific scenario narrative, which is relevant considering the exposure of key portfolios to economic risks, and for  which  a  set  of  consistent  macroeconomic  variables  is determined. The estimation of the appropriate weights for these scenarios is predominantly judgement-based. The assessment is based on a holistic review of the prevailing economic or political conditions, which may exhibit different levels of uncertainty. It takes into account the impact of changes in the nature and severity of the underlying scenario narratives and the projected economic variables.\n\nThe determined weights constitute the probabilities that the respective set of macroeconomic conditions will occur and not that the chosen particular narratives with the related macroeconomic variables will materialize.\n\n## Macroeconomic and other factors\n\nThe range of macroeconomic, market and other factors that is modeled  as  part  of  the  scenario  determination  is  wide,  and historical information is used to support the identification of the key factors. As the forecast horizon increases, the availability of information decreases, requiring an increase in judgment. For cycle-sensitive PD and LGD determination purposes, UBS projects the relevant economic factors for a period of three years before reverting, over a specified period, to cycle-neutral PD and LGD for longer-term projections.\n\nFactors relevant for ECL calculation vary by type of exposure. Regional and client-segment characteristics are generally taken into account, with specific focus on Switzerland and the US, considering UBS's key ECL-relevant portfolios.\n\nFor  UBS,  the  following  forward-looking  macroeconomic variables represent the most relevant factors for ECL calculation:\n\n- -GDP growth rates, given their significant effect on borrowers' performance;\n- -unemployment rates, given their significant effect on private clients' ability to meet contractual obligations;\n- -house price indices, given their significant effect on mortgage collateral valuations;\n- -interest rates, given their significant effect on counterparties' abilities to service debt;\n- -consumer  price  indices,  given  their  overall  relevance  for companies' performance, private clients' purchasing power and economic stability; and\n- -equity indices, given that they are an important factor in our corporate rating tools.\n\n## Scenario generation, review process and governance\n\nA team of economists, who are part of Group Risk Control, develop the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions with involvement from a broad range of experts.\n\nThe scenarios, their weight and the key macroeconomic and other factors are subject to a critical assessment by the IFRS 9 Scenario Sounding Sessions and ECL Management Forum, which include senior management from Group Risk and Group Finance. Important aspects for the review include whether there may be particular credit risk concerns that may not be capable of being addressed systematically and require post-model adjustments for stage allocation and ECL allowance.\n\nThe  Group  Model  Governance  Committee,  as  the  highest authority under UBS's model governance framework, ratifies the decisions taken by the ECL Management Forum.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 20 for more information\n\n## ECL measurement period\n\nThe period for which lifetime ECL are determined is based on the maximum contractual period that UBS is exposed to credit risk, taking  into  account  contractual  extension,  termination  and prepayment  options.  For  irrevocable  loan  commitments  and financial guarantee contracts, the measurement period represents the maximum contractual period for which UBS has an obligation to extend credit.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nAdditionally, some financial instruments include both an ondemand loan and a revocable undrawn commitment, where the contractual cancellation right does not limit UBS's exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, as the client has the ability to draw down funds before UBS can take risk-mitigating actions. In such cases UBS is required to estimate the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. This applies to UBS's credit card limits, which do not have a defined contractual maturity date, are callable  on  demand  and  where  the  drawn  and  undrawn components are managed as one exposure. The exposure arising from UBS's credit card limits is not significant and is managed at a portfolio level, with credit actions triggered when balances are past due. An ECL measurement period of seven years is applied for credit card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 balances, as a proxy for the period that UBS is exposed to credit risk.\n\nCustomary master credit agreements in the Swiss corporate market also include on-demand loans and revocable undrawn commitments.  For  smaller  commercial  facilities,  a  risk-based monitoring (RbM) approach is in place that highlights negative trends as risk events, at an individual facility level, based on a combination of continuously updated risk indicators. The risk events trigger additional credit reviews by a risk officer, enabling informed credit decisions to be taken. Larger corporate facilities are not subject to RbM, but are reviewed at least annually through a  formal  credit  review.  UBS  has  assessed  these  credit  risk management practices and considers both the RbM approach and formal credit reviews as substantive credit reviews resulting in a re-origination of the given facility. Following this, a 12-month measurement period from the reporting date is used for both types of facilities as an appropriate proxy of the period over which UBS is exposed to credit risk, with 12 months also used as a lookback  period  for  assessing  SICR,  always  from  the  respective reporting date.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nFinancial  instruments  subject  to  ECL  are  monitored  on  an ongoing  basis.  To  determine  whether  the  recognition  of  a maximum  12-month  ECL  continues  to  be  appropriate,  an assessment is made as to whether an SICR has occurred since initial recognition of the financial instrument, applying both quantitative and qualitative factors.\n\nPrimarily,  UBS  assesses  changes  in  an  instrument's  risk  of default on a quantitative basis by comparing the annualized forward-looking  and  scenario-weighted  lifetime  PD  of  an instrument determined at two different dates:\n\n- -at the reporting date; and\n- -at inception of the instrument.\n- If, based on UBS's quantitative modeling, an increase exceeds\n\na set threshold, an SICR is deemed to have occurred and the instrument is transferred to stage 2 with lifetime ECL recognized.\n\nThe threshold applied varies depending on the original credit quality of the borrower, with a higher SICR threshold set for those instruments with a low PD at inception. The SICR assessment based on PD changes is made at an individual financial asset level. A high-level overview of the SICR trigger, which is a multiple of the annualized remaining lifetime PIT PD expressed in rating downgrades, is provided in the 'SICR thresholds' table below. The actual SICR thresholds applied are defined on a more granular level by interpolating between the values shown in the table.\n\nSICR thresholds\n\n| Internal rating at origination  of the instrument   |   Rating downgrades / SICR trigger |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| 0-3                                                 |                                  3 |\n| 4-8                                                 |                                  2 |\n| 9-13                                                |                                  1 |\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more details about UBS's internal grading system\n\nIrrespective of the  SICR  assessment  based  on  default probabilities, credit risk is generally deemed to have significantly increased for an instrument if the contractual payments are more than  30  days  past  due.  For  certain  less  material  portfolios, specifically the Swiss credit card portfolio, the 30-day past due criterion is used as the primary indicator of an SICR. Where instruments are transferred to stage 2 due to the 30-day past due criterion, a minimum period of six months is applied before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered. For instruments in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland that are between 90 and 180 days past due but have not been reclassified to stage 3, a one-year period is applied before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered.\n\nAdditionally, based on individual counterparty-specific indicators, external market indicators of credit risk or general economic conditions, counterparties may be moved to a watch list, which is used as a secondary qualitative indicator for an SICR. Exception management is further applied, allowing for individual and collective adjustments on exposures sharing the same credit risk characteristics to take account of specific situations that are not otherwise fully reflected.\n\nIn general, the overall SICR determination process does not apply to Lombard loans, securities financing transactions and certain other asset-based lending transactions, because of the risk management  practices  adopted,  including  daily  monitoring processes with strict margining. If margin calls are not satisfied, a position is closed out and classified as a stage 3 position. In exceptional cases, an individual adjustment and a transfer into stage 2 may be made to take account of specific facts.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nCredit risk officers are responsible for the identification of an SICR, which for accounting purposes is in some respects different from internal credit risk management processes. This difference mainly arises because ECL  accounting  requirements  are instrument-specific,  such  that  a  borrower  can  have  multiple exposures allocated to different stages, and maturing loans in stage 2 will migrate to stage 1 upon renewal irrespective of the actual credit risk at that time. Under a risk-based approach, a holistic counterparty credit assessment and the absolute level of risk at any given date will determine what risk-mitigating actions may be warranted.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe calculation of ECL requires management to apply significant judgment and make estimates and assumptions that can result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL recognized.\n\n## Determination of a significant increase in credit risk\n\nIFRS 9 does not include a definition of what constitutes an SICR, with UBS's assessment considering qualitative and quantitative criteria. An IFRS 9 ECL Management Forum has been established to review and challenge the SICR results.\n\n## Scenarios, scenario weights and macroeconomic variables\n\nECL reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount, which UBS determines by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. Management selects forward-looking scenarios that include relevant macroeconomic variables  and  management's  assumptions  around  future  economic conditions. IFRS 9 Scenario Sounding Sessions, in addition to the IFRS 9 ECL Management Forum, are in place to derive, review and challenge the scenario selection and weights, and to determine whether any additional post-model adjustments are required that may significantly affect ECL.\n\n## ECL measurement period\n\nLifetime ECL are generally determined based upon the contractual maturity of the transaction, which significantly affects ECL. For credit card limits and Swiss callable master credit facilities, judgment is required, as UBS must determine the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. A seven-year period is applied for credit card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 positions, and a 12-month period applied for master credit facilities.\n\n## Modeling and post-model adjustments\n\nA number of complex models have been developed or modified to calculate ECL,  with  additional  post-model  adjustments  required  which  may significantly affect ECL. The models are governed by UBS's model validation controls and approved by the Group Model Governance Committee (the GMGC).  The  post-model  adjustments  are  approved  by  the  ECL Management Forum and endorsed by the GMGC.\n\n- A  sensitivity  analysis  covering  key  macroeconomic  variables,  scenario weights and SICR trigger points on ECL measurement is provided in Note 20f.\n- \u203a Refer to Note 20 for more information\n\n## h. Restructured and modified financial assets\n\nWhen payment default is expected, or where default has already occurred, UBS may grant concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that it would not consider in the normal course of its business, such as preferential interest rates, extension of maturity, modifying  the  schedule  of  repayments,  debt  /  equity  swap, subordination, etc. When a concession or forbearance measure is granted, each case is considered individually and the exposure is generally classified as being in default. Forbearance classification will  remain  until  the  loan  is  collected  or  written  off,  nonpreferential conditions superseding preferential conditions are granted  or  until  the  counterparty  has  recovered  and  the preferential conditions no longer exceed UBS's risk tolerance.\n\nModifications result in an alteration of future contractual cash flows and can occur within UBS's normal risk tolerance or as part of a credit restructuring where a counterparty is in financial difficulties. The restructuring or modification of a financial asset could lead to a substantial change in the terms and conditions, resulting in the original financial asset being derecognized and a new financial asset being recognized. Where the modification does not result in a derecognition, any difference between the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original EIR and the existing gross carrying amount of the given financial asset is recognized in the income statement as a modification gain or loss.\n\n## i. Offsetting\n\nUBS presents financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet net if (i) it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and (ii) it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Netted positions include, for example, certain derivatives and repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions with various counterparties, exchanges and clearing houses.\n\nIn assessing whether UBS intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously, emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of operational settlement mechanics  in  eliminating  substantially  all  credit  and  liquidity exposure between the counterparties. This condition precludes offsetting on the balance sheet for substantial amounts of UBS's financial assets and liabilities, even though they may be subject to enforceable netting arrangements. Repurchase arrangements and securities financing transactions are presented net only to the extent that the settlement mechanism eliminates, or results in insignificant, credit and  liquidity  risk, and  processes  the receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 22 for more information",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\n## j. Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, unless stated otherwise below, where the criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. If a hedge relationship no longer meets  the  criteria  for  hedge  accounting,  hedge  accounting  is discontinued. Voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting is permitted under IAS 39 but not under IFRS 9.\n\n## Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets\n\nThe fair value change of the hedged item attributable to a hedged risk is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item, and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges of portfolio interest rate risk related to loans designated under IAS 39\n\nPrior to discontinuation in December 2021, the fair value change of the hedged item attributable to a hedged risk is reflected within Other  financial  assets  measured  at  amortized  cost or Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges of FX risk related to debt instruments\n\nThe fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in the measurement of the hedged item and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The foreign currency basis  spread  of  cross-currency  swaps  designated  as  hedging derivatives is excluded from the designation and accounted for as a cost of hedging with amounts deferred in Other comprehensive income within Equity . These amounts are released to the income statement over the term of the hedged item.\n\n## Discontinuation of fair value hedges\n\nDiscontinuations for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item result in an adjustment to the carrying amount, which is amortized to the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value adjustment or deferred cost of hedging amount is recognized immediately in the income statement as part of any derecognition gain or loss.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n\nFair value gains or losses associated with the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for cash flow repricing risk are recognized initially in Other comprehensive income within Equity and reclassified to the income statement in the periods when  the  hedged  forecast  cash  flows  affect  profit  or  loss, including discontinued hedges for which forecast cash flows are expected to occur. If the forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, the deferred gains or losses are immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nGains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of a hedge are recognized directly in Other comprehensive income within Equity, while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective and / or undesignated portion (for example, the interest element  of  a  forward  contract)  are  recognized  in  the  income statement. Upon disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized in Equity associated with the entity is reclassified to Other income .\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nUBS  can  continue  hedge  accounting  during  the  period  of uncertainty before existing interest rate benchmarks are replaced with alternative risk-free interest rates. During this period, UBS can assume that the current benchmark rates will continue to exist,  such  that  forecast  transactions  are  considered  highly probable  and  hedge  relationships  remain,  with  little  or  no consequential  impact  on  the  financial  statements.  Upon replacement of existing interest rate benchmarks by alternative risk-free interest rates expected in 2021 and beyond, UBS will apply the requirements of Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2).\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1b for more information\n\n## 3) Fee and commission income and expenses\n\nUBS  earns  fee  income  from  the  diverse  range  of  services  it provides to its clients. Fee income can be divided into two broad categories: fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time, such as management of clients' assets, custody services and certain advisory services; and fees earned from  point-in-time  services,  such  as  underwriting  fees,  dealcontingent merger and acquisitions fees, and brokerage fees (e.g.,  securities  and  derivatives  execution  and  clearing).  UBS recognizes fees earned from point-in-time services when it has fully provided the service to the customer. Where the contract requires services to be provided over time, income is recognized on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.\n\nConsideration received is allocated to the separately identifiable performance obligations in a contract. Owing to the nature  of  UBS's  business,  contracts  that  include  multiple performance obligations are typically those that are considered to include a series of similar performance obligations fulfilled over time  with  the  same  pattern  of  transfer  to  the  client,  e.g., management  of  client  assets  and  custodial  services.  As  a consequence, UBS is not required to apply significant judgment in allocating the consideration received across the various performance obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\nPoint-in-time  services  are  generally  for  a  fixed  price  or dependent on deal size, e.g., a fixed number of basis points of trade size, where the amount of revenue is known when the performance  obligation  is  met.  Fixed  over-time  fees  are recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Custodial and asset management fees can be variable through reference to the size of the customer portfolio. However, they are generally  billed  on  a  monthly  or  quarterly  basis  once  the customer's portfolio size is known or known with near certainty and  therefore  also  recognized  ratably  over  the  performance period. UBS does not recognize performance fees related to management of clients' assets or fees related to contingencies beyond UBS's control until such uncertainties are resolved.\n\nUBS's fees are generally earned from short-term contracts. As a result, UBS's contracts do not include a financing component or result in the recognition of significant receivables or prepayment assets.  Furthermore,  due  to  the  short-term  nature  of  such contracts, UBS has not capitalized any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract or generated any significant contract assets or liabilities.\n\nUBS presents expenses primarily in line with their nature in the income  statement,  differentiating  between  expenses  that  are directly attributable to the satisfaction of specific performance obligations associated with the generation of revenues, which are generally presented within Total operating income as Fee and commission expense , and those that are related to personnel, general and administrative expenses, which are presented within Total operating expenses . For derivatives execution and clearing services (where UBS acts as an agent), UBS only records its specific fees in the income statement, with fees payable to other parties not recognized as an expense but instead directly offset against the associated income collected from the given client.\n\n- Refer to Note 4 for more information, including the\n- \u203a disaggregation of revenues\n\n## 4) Share-based and other deferred compensation plans\n\nUBS recognizes expenses for deferred compensation awards over the period that the employee is required to provide service to become  entitled  to  the  award.  Where  the  service  period  is shortened, for example in the case of employees affected by restructuring programs or mutually agreed termination provisions, recognition of such expense is accelerated to the termination date. Where no future service is required, such as for employees who are eligible for retirement or who have met certain age and length-of-service criteria, the services are presumed to have been received  and  compensation  expense  is  recognized  over  the performance year or, in the case of off-cycle awards, immediately on the grant date.\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nShare-based compensation expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date of grant, taking into account the terms and conditions inherent in the award,  including,  where  relevant,  dividend  rights,  transfer restrictions in effect beyond the vesting date, market conditions, and non-vesting conditions.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, fair value is not remeasured unless the  terms  of  the  award  are  modified  such  that  there  is  an incremental increase in value. Expenses are recognized, on a pertranche basis, over the service period based on an estimate of the number of instruments expected to vest and are adjusted to reflect the actual outcomes of service or performance conditions.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, forfeiture events resulting from a breach of a non-vesting condition (i.e., one that does not relate to  a  service  or  performance  condition)  do  not  result  in  any adjustment to the share-based compensation expense.\n\nFor cash-settled share-based awards, fair value is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense recognized equals the cash distributed.\n\n## Other deferred compensation plans\n\nCompensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recognized on a per-tranche or straight-line basis, depending on the nature of the plan. The amount recognized is measured based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the plan and is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense recognized equals the cash or the fair value of respective financial instruments distributed.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 28 for more information",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\n## 5) Post-employment benefit plans\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  specify  an  amount  of  benefit  that  an employee will receive, which usually depends on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. The defined benefit liability recognized in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation, measured using the projected unit credit method, less the fair value of the plan's assets at the balance sheet date, with changes resulting from remeasurements recorded immediately in Other comprehensive income . If the fair value of the plan's assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits  available  in  the  form  of  refunds  from  the  plan  or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Calculation of the net defined benefit obligation or asset takes into account the specific features of each plan, including risk sharing between employee  and  employer,  and  is  calculated  periodically  by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe net defined benefit liability or asset at the balance sheet date and the related personnel expense depend on the expected future benefits to be provided, determined using a number of economic and demographic assumptions. A range of assumptions could be applied, and different assumptions could significantly alter the defined benefit liability or asset and pension expense recognized. The most significant assumptions include life expectancy, discount rate, expected salary increases, pension increases and interest credits on retirement savings account balances. Sensitivity analysis for reasonable possible movements in each significant assumption for UBS's post-employment obligations is provided in Note 27.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 27 for more information\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nA  defined  contribution  plan  pays  fixed  contributions  into  a separate entity from which post-employment and other benefits are paid. UBS has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts  if  the  plan  does  not  hold  sufficient  assets  to  pay employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Compensation expense is recognized when the employees have rendered services in exchange for contributions. This is generally in the year of contribution. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## 6) Income taxes\n\nUBS is subject to the income tax laws of Switzerland and those of the non-Swiss jurisdictions in which UBS has business operations.\n\nThe Group's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes represent taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period or previous periods.\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognized  for  temporary  differences between  the  carrying  amounts  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future periods and are measured using the applicable tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.\n\nDeferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources, the most significant being: (i) tax losses that can be carried forward to be used against profits in future years; and (ii) temporary differences that  will  result  in  deductions  against  profits  in  future  years. Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these differences can be used. When an entity or tax group has a history of recent losses, deferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet that reflect the expectation that certain items will give rise to taxable income in future periods.\n\nDeferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when: (i) they arise in the same tax reporting group; (ii) they relate to the same tax authority; (iii) the legal right to offset exists; and (iv) they are intended to be settled net or realized simultaneously.\n\nCurrent  and  deferred  taxes  are  recognized  as  income  tax benefit or expense in the income statement, except for current and deferred taxes recognized in relation to: (i) the acquisition of a subsidiary (for which such amounts would affect the amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition); (ii) gains and losses on the sale of treasury shares (for which the tax effects are recognized directly in Equity ); (iii) unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments that are classified at FVOCI; (iv) changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges; (v) remeasurements of defined benefit plans; or (vi) certain foreign currency translations of foreign operations. Amounts relating to points (iii) through  (vi) above  are  recognized  in Other comprehensive income within Equity .\n\nUBS reflects the potential effect of uncertain tax positions for which acceptance by the relevant tax authority is not considered probable by adjusting current or deferred taxes, as applicable, using either the most likely amount or expected value methods, depending on which method is deemed a better predictor of the basis on which, and extent to which, the uncertainty will be resolved.",

UBS considers the performance of its businesses and the accuracy of historical forecasts and other factors when evaluating the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, including the remaining tax loss carry-forward period, and its assessment of expected future taxable profits in the forecast period  used  for  recognizing  deferred  tax  assets.  Estimating  future profitability and business plan forecasts is inherently subjective and is particularly sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions.\n\nForecasts are reviewed annually, but adjustments may be made at other times, if required. If recent losses have been incurred, convincing evidence is required to prove there is sufficient future profitability given the value of UBS's deferred tax assets may be affected, with effects primarily recognized through the income statement.\n\nIn addition, judgment is required to assess the expected value of uncertain tax positions and the related probabilities, including interpretation of tax laws, the resolution of any income tax-related appeals and litigation.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 8 for more information\n\n## 7) Property, equipment and software\n\nProperty,  equipment  and  software  is  measured  at  cost  less accumulated  depreciation  and  impairment  losses.  Software development costs are capitalized only when the costs can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic benefits will  arise.  Depreciation  of  property,  equipment  and  software begins when they are available for use and is calculated on a straight line basis over an asset's estimated useful life.\n\nProperty, equipment and software are generally tested for impairment  at  the  appropriate  cash-generating  unit  level, alongside goodwill and intangible assets as described in item 8 in this Note. An impairment charge is recognized for such assets if the  recoverable  amount  is  below  its  carrying  amount.  The recoverable amounts of such assets, other than property that has a market price, are generally determined using a replacement cost approach  that  reflects  the  amount  that  would  be  currently required by a market participant to replace the service capacity of the asset. If such assets are no longer used, they are tested individually for impairment.\n\n## \u203a Refer to Note 12 for more information\n\n## 8) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the fair value  of  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities acquired that arises in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period, or when indicators of impairment exist. UBS tests goodwill for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment.\n\nAn impairment charge is recognized in the income statement if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nUBS's methodology for goodwill impairment testing is based on a model that is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: (i) forecasts of earnings available to shareholders in years one to three; (ii) changes in the discount rates; and (iii) changes in the long-term growth rate.\n\nEarnings available to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan approved by the Board of Directors.  The  discount  rates  and  growth  rates  are  determined  using external information, and also considering inputs from both internal and external analysts and the view of management.\n\nThe key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of each cash-generating unit are tested for sensitivity by applying reasonably possible changes to those assumptions.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Notes 2 and 13 for more information\n\n## 9) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, and are generally  recognized  in  accordance  with  IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , when: (i) UBS has a present obligation as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe majority of UBS's provisions relate to litigation, regulatory and  similar  matters,  restructuring,  and  employee  benefits. Restructuring provisions are generally recognized as a consequence of management agreeing to materially change the scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted, including  changes  in  management  structures.  Provisions  for employee  benefits  relate  mainly  to  service  anniversaries  and sabbatical  leave,  and  are  recognized  in  accordance  with measurement principles set out in item 4 in this Note. In addition, UBS presents expected credit loss allowances within Provisions if they relate to a loan commitment, financial guarantee contract or a revolving revocable credit line.\n\nIAS 37 provisions are measured considering the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\nWhen conditions required to recognize a provision are not met, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the likelihood of an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed for possible obligations that arise from past events the existence of which will be confirmed only by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of UBS.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1  Summary of material accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nRecognition of provisions often involves significant judgment in assessing the  existence  of  an  obligation  that  results  from  past  events  and  in estimating the probability, timing and amount of any outflows of resources. This is particularly the case for litigation, regulatory and similar matters, which, due to their nature, are subject to many uncertainties, making their outcome difficult to predict.\n\nThe amount of any provision recognized is sensitive to the assumptions used and there could be a wide range of possible outcomes for any particular matter.\n\nManagement regularly reviews all the available information regarding such matters, including legal advice, to assess whether the recognition criteria for provisions have been satisfied and to determine the timing and amount of any potential outflows.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 18 for more information\n\n## 10) Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the reporting entity at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, all monetary assets, including those at FVOCI, and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the closing exchange rate. Translation differences  are  reported  in Other  net  income  from  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss .\n\nNon-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.\n\nUpon consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into US dollars, UBS's presentation currency, at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and income and expense items and other comprehensive income are translated at the average rate for the period. The resulting foreign currency\n\ntranslation differences are recognized in Equity and reclassified to the income statement when UBS disposes of, partially or in its entirety, the foreign operation and UBS no longer controls the foreign operation.\n\nShare capital issued, share premium and treasury shares held are translated at the historic average rate, with the difference between the historic average rate and the spot rate realized upon repayment of share capital or disposal of treasury shares reported as Share premium. Cumulative amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income in  respect  of  cash  flow  hedges  and  financial  assets measured at FVOCI are translated at the closing exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates, with any translation effects adjusted through Retained earnings .\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 33 for more information\n\n## 11) Equity, treasury shares and contracts on UBS Group AG shares\n\n## UBS Group AG shares held (treasury shares)\n\nUBS  Group  AG  shares  held  by  the  Group,  including  those purchased as part of market-making activities, are presented in Equity as Treasury  shares at  their  acquisition  cost  and  are deducted from Equity until they are canceled or reissued. The difference between the proceeds from sales of treasury shares and their weighted average cost (net of tax, if any) is reported as Share premium .\n\n## Net cash settlement contracts\n\nContracts involving UBS Group AG shares that require net cash settlement, or provide the counterparty or UBS with a settlement option that includes a choice of settling net in cash, are classified as derivatives held for trading.",

        "page_content": "## b) Changes in accounting policies, comparability and other adjustments\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , and IFRS Practice Statement 2, Making Materiality Judgements\n\nEffective from 1 January 2021, UBS early adopted amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements , and IFRS Practice Statement 2, Making Materiality Judgements , issued by IASB in February 2021. The disclosure of material accounting policies in Note 1a has been refined through adopting these amendments.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 ( Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 )\n\nOn  1 January  2021,  UBS  adopted Interest  Rate  Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) , addressing a number of issues in financial reporting areas that arise when interbank offered rates (IBORs) are reformed or replaced. The amendments provide a practical expedient that permits certain changes in the contractual cash flows of debt instruments  attributable  to  the  replacement  of  IBORs  with alternative reference rates (ARRs) to be accounted  for prospectively by updating a given instrument's effective interest rate  (EIR),  provided  (i)  the  change  is  necessary  as  a  direct consequence  of  IBOR  reform  and  (ii)  the  new  basis  for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis. UBS has adopted the amendments, which had no material effect on the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe  amendments  also  provide  various  hedge  accounting reliefs, with the following adopted by UBS:\n\n- -Designate  an  ARR  as  a  non-contractually  specified  risk component, even if it is not separately identifiable at the date when it was designated, provided UBS can reasonably expect that it will meet the requirements within 24 months of the first designation and the risk component is reliably measurable. As of  31 December  2021,  the  principal  ARRs  that  UBS  has designated as the hedged risk in fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments, mortgages and cash flow hedges of forecast transactions were the Secured Overnight Financing  Rate  (SOFR),  the  Swiss  Average  Rate  Overnight (SARON) and the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).\n- -Amend hedge documentation for the fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments for which the hedged risk changed due to IBOR reform, which allowed UBS to continue the hedge relationship in accordance with the requirements of the phase 2 amendment.\n- -The cash flow hedges of IBOR forecast transactions in Swiss francs and pounds sterling were discontinued and replaced with new ARR designations in December 2021. The amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the ARR on which the hedged future cash flows will be based. Amounts will be released to the income statement when the forecast ARR cash flows affect the income statement or are no longer expected to occur.\n- \u203a Refer to Note 26 for more information\n\nThe  amendments  also  introduced  additional  disclosure requirements  regarding  the  Group's  management  of  the transition to alternative benchmark rates, its progress as at the reporting date and the risks to which it is exposed arising from financial instruments because of the transition.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 25 for more information\n\n## c) International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations to be adopted in 2022 and later and other changes\n\n## IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts , which sets out the accounting requirements for contractual rights and obligations  that  arise  from  insurance  contracts  issued  and\n\nreinsurance contracts held. IFRS 17 is effective from 1 January 2023. UBS is assessing the standard, but does not expect it to have a material effect on the Group's financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2a  Segment reporting\n\nUBS's  businesses  are  organized  globally  into  four  business divisions:  Global  Wealth  Management,  Personal  &  Corporate Banking, Asset Management and the Investment Bank. All four business divisions are supported by Group Functions and qualify as reportable segments for the purpose of segment reporting. Together with Group Functions, the four business divisions reflect the management structure of the Group.\n\n- -Global  Wealth  Management provides  financial  services, advice and solutions to private clients, in particular in the ultra high net worth and high net worth segments. Its offering ranges from investment management to estate planning and corporate  finance  advice,  in  addition  to  specific  wealth management products and services. The business division is managed globally across the regions.\n- -Personal & Corporate Banking serves its private, corporate, and  institutional  clients'  needs,  from  basic  banking  to retirement, financing, investments and strategic transactions, in  Switzerland,  through  its  branch  network  and  digital channels.\n- -Asset Management is a large-scale and diversified global asset  manager.  It  offers  investment  capabilities  and  styles across all major traditional and alternative asset classes, as well as advisory support to institutions, wholesale intermediaries and wealth management clients globally.\n- -The Investment  Bank provides  a  range  of  services  to institutional, corporate  and  wealth  management  clients globally, to help them raise capital, grow their businesses, invest and manage risks. Its offering includes advisory services, facilitating clients raising debt and equity from the public and private  markets  and  capital  markets,  cash  and  derivatives trading across equities and fixed income, and financing.\n- -Group Functions is made up of the following major areas: Group  Services  (which  consists  of  Technology,  Corporate Services,  Human  Resources,  Finance,  Legal,  Risk  Control, Compliance, Regulatory & Governance, Communications & Branding  and  Group  Sustainability  and  Impact),  Group Treasury and Non-core and Legacy Portfolio.\n\nFinancial information about the four business divisions and Group Functions is presented separately in internal management reports  to  the  Group  Executive  Board  (the  GEB),  which  is considered the 'chief operating decision maker' pursuant to IFRS 8, Operating Segments .\n\nUBS's internal accounting policies, which include management accounting policies and service level agreements, determine the revenues and expenses directly attributable to each reportable segment.  Transactions  between  the  reportable  segments  are carried out at internally agreed rates and are reflected in the operating results of the reportable segments. Revenue-sharing agreements  are  used  to  allocate  external  client  revenues  to reportable  segments  where  several  reportable  segments  are involved in the value creation chain. Total intersegment revenues for the Group are immaterial, as the majority of the revenues are allocated  across  the  segments  by  means  of  revenue-sharing agreements.  Interest  income  earned  from  managing  UBS's consolidated equity is allocated to the reportable segments based on average attributed equity and currency composition. Assets and liabilities of the reportable segments are funded through and invested with Group Functions, and the net interest margin is reflected in the results of each reportable segment.\n\nSegment assets are based on a third-party view and do not include intercompany balances. This view is in line with internal reporting to the GEB. If one operating segment is involved in an external transaction together with another operating segment or Group Functions, additional criteria are considered to determine the segment that will report the associated assets. This will include a consideration of which segment's business needs are being addressed by the transaction and which segment is providing the funding and / or resources. Allocation of liabilities follows the same principles.\n\nNon-current assets disclosed for segment reporting purposes represent assets that are expected to be recovered more than 12 months after the reporting date, excluding financial instruments, deferred tax assets and post-employment benefits.",

The allocation of operating income to these regions reflects, and is consistent with,  the  basis  on  which  the  business  is  managed  and  its performance is evaluated. These allocations involve assumptions and judgments that management considers to be reasonable, and may be refined to reflect changes in estimates or management structure. The main principles of the allocation methodology are that client revenues are attributed to the domicile of the given\n\nclient  and  trading  and  portfolio  management  revenues  are attributed to the country where the risk is managed. This revenue attribution  is  consistent  with  the  mandate  of  the  regional Presidents. Certain revenues, such as those related to Non-core and Legacy Portfolio in Group Functions, are managed at a Group level. These revenues are included in the Global line.\n\nThe geographic analysis of non-current assets is based on the location of the entity in which the given assets are recorded.\n\n## For the year ended

These included Swiss tax expenses of USD 714 million and nonSwiss tax expenses of USD 1,284 million.\n\nThe  Swiss  tax  expenses  included  current  tax  expenses  of USD 680 million related to taxable profits of UBS Switzerland AG and other Swiss entities. They also included deferred tax expenses of  USD 34  million,  which  reflect  movements  in  temporary differences.\n\nThe non-Swiss tax expenses included current tax expenses of USD 884 million related to taxable profits earned by non-Swiss subsidiaries  and  branches,  and  net  deferred  tax  expenses  of USD 400 million. Expenses of USD 734 million, which primarily related  to  the  amortization  of  deferred  tax  assets  (DTAs) previously recognized in relation to tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences of UBS Americas Inc., were\n\npartly offset by a benefit of USD 334 million in respect of the remeasurement  of DTAs. This benefit included upward revaluations  of  DTAs  of  USD 152  million  for  certain  entities, primarily in connection with our business planning process. It also included USD 113 million in respect of additional DTA recognition that primarily related to the contribution of real estate assets by UBS AG to UBS Americas Inc. and UBS Financial Services Inc., which allowed the full recognition of DTAs in respect of the associated  historic  real  estate  costs  that  were  previously capitalized for US tax purposes under elections that were made in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, it included USD 69 million in respect of an increase in the expected value of future tax deductions for deferred compensation awards, due to an increase in the Group's share price during the year.\n\nThe pre-tax expense that was recognized in the year in respect of the increase in litigation provisions for the French cross-border matter did not result in any tax benefit.\n\n|                                                                                     | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD million                                                                         | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             | 31.12.19             |\n| Operating profit / (loss) before tax                                                | 99,,448844           | 8,155                | 5,577                |\n| of which: Swiss                                                                     | 33,,333344           | 3,403                | 2,571                |\n| of which: non-Swiss                                                                 | 66,,115500           | 4,752                | 3,006                |\n| Income taxes at Swiss tax rate of 18.5% for 2021, 19.5% for 2020 and 20.5% for 2019 | 11,,775555           | 1,590                | 1,143                |\n| Increase / (decrease) resulting from:                                               |                      |                      |                      |\n| Non-Swiss tax rates differing from Swiss tax rate                                   | 223344               | 110                  | 82                   |\n| Tax effects of losses not recognized                                                | 112244               | 144                  | 131                  |\n| Previously unrecognized tax losses now utilized                                     | ((117799))           | (212)                | (265)                |\n| Non-taxable and lower-taxed income                                                  | ((227788))           | (394)                | (351)                |\n| Non-deductible expenses and additional taxable income                               | 551100               | 385                  | 732                  |\n| Adjustments related to prior years - current tax                                    | ((4400))             | (67)                 | (5)                  |\n| Adjustments related to prior years - deferred tax                                   | ((1100))             | 12                   | (6)                  |\n| Change in deferred tax recognition                                                  | ((334422))           | (381)                | (294)                |\n| Adjustments to deferred tax balances arising from changes in tax rates              | ((55))               | 234                  | (9)                  |\n| Other items                                                                         | 223311               | 161                  | 107                  |\n| IInnccoommee  ttaaxx  eexxppeennssee  //  ((bbeenneeffiitt))                        | 11,,999988           | 1,583                | 1,267                |",

The valuation allowances reflect DTAs that were not recognized because, as of the last remeasurement period, management did not consider it probable that there would be sufficient future taxable profits available  to  utilize  the  related  tax  loss  carry-forwards  and deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe recognition of DTAs is supported by forecasts of taxable profits  for  the  entities  concerned.  In  addition,  tax  planning opportunities are available that would result in additional future taxable income and these would be utilized, if necessary.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized in respect of investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the associated taxable temporary difference and it is probable that such will not reverse in the foreseeable  future.  However,  as  of  31 December  2021,  this exception was not considered to apply to any taxable temporary differences.\n\n| USD million                                                             | 3 311..1122..2211   | 3 311..1122..2211                       | 3 311..1122..2211     | 31.12.20   | 31.12.20            | 31.12.20   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets 1                                                   | G Grroossss         | V Vaalluuaattiioonn a alllloowwaannccee | R Reeccooggnniizzeedd | Gross      | Valuation allowance | Recognized |\n| Tax loss carry-forwards                                                 | 1133,,663366        | ((99,,119933))                          | 44,,444433            | 14,108     | (8,715)             | 5,393      |\n| Temporary differences                                                   | 55,,113333          | ((770000))                              | 44,,443333            | 4,384      | (565)               | 3,819      |\n| of which: related to real estate costs capitalized for US tax  purposes | 22,,227722          | 00                                      | 22,,227722            | 2,268      | 0                   | 2,268      |\n| of which: related to compensation and benefits                          | 11,,222222          | ((220099))                              | 11,,001133            | 1,128      | (173)               | 955        |\n| of which: other                                                         | 11,,663399          | ((449911))                              | 11,,114488            | 989        | (392)               | 564        |\n| T Toottaall  ddeeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx  aasssseettss                     | 1188,,776699        | ((99,,889933))                          | 88,,887766 2 2        | 18,492     | (9,280)             | 9,212 2    |\n| of which: related to the US                                             |                     |                                         | 88,,552211            |            |                     | 8,780      |\n| of which: related to other locations                                    |                     |                                         | 335555                |            |                     | 431        |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                |                     |                                         |                       |            |                     |            |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                        |                     |                                         | 111188                |            |                     | 425        |\n| Other                                                                   |                     |                                         | 118833                |            |                     | 139        |\n| TToottaall  ddeeffeerrrreedd  ttaaxx  lliiaabbiilliittiieess            |                     |                                         | 330000                |            |                     | 564        |\n\n- 1 1 After offset of DTLs, as applicable. 2 2 As of 31 December 2021, the Group recognized DTAs of USD 77 million (31 December 2020: USD 138 million) in respect of entities that incurred losses in either the current or preceding year.\n\nIn general, US federal tax losses incurred prior to 31 December 2017 can be carried forward for 20 years.

Core loan exposure is defined as the sum of Loans and advances to customers and Loans to financial advisors .\n\nThese ratios are influenced by the following key factors:\n\n- -Lombard  loans  are  generally  secured  with  marketable securities in portfolios that are, as a rule, highly diversified, with strict lending policies that are intended to ensure that credit risk is minimal under most circumstances;\n- -mortgage loans to private clients and real estate financing are controlled  by  conservative  eligibility  criteria,  including  low loan-to-value ratios and strong debt service capabilities;\n- -the amount of unsecured retail lending (including credit cards) is insignificant;\n\n## Coverage ratios for core loan portfolio\n\n## 3311..1122..2211\n\n|

        "page_content": "## Note 10  Derivative instruments\n\n## Overview\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts are usually traded under  a  standardized  International  Swaps  and  Derivatives Association  (ISDA)  master  agreement  between  UBS  and  its counterparties. Terms are negotiated directly with counterparties and the contracts have industry-standard settlement mechanisms prescribed by ISDA. Other OTC derivatives are cleared through clearing houses, in particular interest rate swaps with LCH, where a settled-to-market method has been generally adopted, under which cash collateral exchanged on a daily basis is considered to legally settle the market value of the derivatives. Regulators in various jurisdictions have begun a phased introduction of rules requiring  the  payment  and  collection  of  initial  and  variation margins on certain OTC derivative contracts, which may have a bearing on price and other relevant terms. Due to challenges brought  on  by  COVID-19,  the  International  Organization  of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) has extended the deadline for completion of the final phase-in of margin requirements for noncentrally cleared derivatives, to 1 September 2022.\n\nOther derivative contracts are standardized in terms of their amounts and settlement dates, and are bought and sold on regulated  exchanges.  These  are  commonly  referred  to  as exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) contracts. Exchanges offer the benefits of pricing transparency, standardized daily settlement of changes in value and, consequently, reduced credit risk.\n\nMost of the Group's derivative transactions relate to sales and market-making activity. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Marketmaking aims to directly support the facilitation and execution of client activity, and involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the aim of generating revenues based on spread  and  volume.  The  Group  also  uses  various  derivative instruments for hedging purposes.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Notes 16 and 21 for more information about derivative instruments\n- \u203a Refer to Note 26 for more information about derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships\n\n## Risks of derivative instruments\n\nThe derivative financial assets shown on the balance sheet can be an  important  component  of  the  Group's  credit  exposure; however, the positive replacement values related to a respective counterparty are rarely an adequate reflection of the Group's credit exposure in its derivatives business with that counterparty. This is generally the case because, on the one hand, replacement values can increase over time (potential future exposure), while, on the other hand, exposure may be mitigated by entering into master netting agreements and bilateral collateral arrangements. Both the exposure measures used internally by the Group to control  credit  risk  and  the  capital  requirements  imposed  by regulators reflect these additional factors.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 22 for more information about derivative financial assets and liabilities after consideration of netting potential allowed under enforceable netting arrangements\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Risk management and control' section of this report for more information about the risks arising from derivative instruments",

instruments. 2 2 In cases where derivative financial instruments are presented on a net basis on the balance sheet, the respective notional amounts of the netted derivative financial instruments are still presented on a gross basis. 3 3 Notional amounts of client-cleared ETD and OTC transactions through central clearing counterparties are not disclosed, as they have significantly different risk profile. 4 4 Other notional amounts relate to derivatives that are cleared through either a central counterparty or an exchange. The fair value of these derivatives is presented on the balance sheet net of the corresponding cash margin under Cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments and Cash collateral payables on derivative instruments and was not material for all periods presented. 5 5 Changes in the fair value of purchased and sold non-derivative financial instruments between trade date and settlement date are recognized as derivative financial instruments. 6 6 Derivative financial assets and liabilities are presented net on the balance sheet if UBS has the unconditional and legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts, both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of the entity and all of the counterparties, and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Refer to Note 22 for more information on netting arrangements.\n\nOn a notional amount basis, approximately 40% of OTC interest rate contracts held as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 50%) mature within one year, 36% (31 December 2020: 30%) within one to five years and 25% (31 December 2020: 20%) after five years.\n\nNotional amounts of interest rate contracts cleared through either a central counterparty or an exchange that are legally settled  on  a  daily  basis  are  presented  under Other  notional\n\namounts in the table above and are categorized into maturity buckets on the basis of contractual maturities of the cleared underlying derivative contracts. Other notional amounts related to interest rate contracts decreased by USD 2.6 trillion compared with 31 December 2020, mainly reflecting trade compressions, which  included  activity  as  part  of  the  ongoing  transition  to alternative reference rates, and maturities.",

        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\nUBS performs an impairment test on its goodwill assets on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist.\n\nUBS considers Asset Management, as it is reported in Note 2a, as a separate cash-generating unit (a CGU), as that is the level at which the performance of investment (and the related goodwill) is reviewed and assessed by management. Given that a significant amount of goodwill in Global Wealth Management relates to the PaineWebber  acquisition  in  2000,  which  mainly  affected  the Americas portion of the business, this goodwill remains separately monitored by the Americas, despite the formation of Global Wealth Management in 2018. Therefore, goodwill for Global Wealth Management is separately considered for impairment at the  level  of  two  CGUs:  Americas;  and  Switzerland  and International (consisting of EMEA, Asia Pacific and Global).\n\nThe impairment test is performed for each CGU to which goodwill  is  allocated  by  comparing  the  recoverable  amount, based  on  its  value  in  use,  with  the  carrying  amount  of  the respective  CGU.  An  impairment  charge  is  recognized  if  the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, total goodwill recognized on the balance sheet was USD 6.1 billion, of which USD 3.7 billion was carried  by  the  Global  Wealth  Management  Americas  CGU, USD 1.2 billion was carried by the Global Wealth Management Switzerland  and  International  CGU,  and  USD 1.2  billion  was carried by Asset Management. Based on the impairment testing methodology described below, UBS concluded that the goodwill balances as of 31 December 2021 allocated to these CGUs are not impaired.\n\n## Methodology for goodwill impairment testing\n\nThe recoverable amounts are determined using a discounted cash flow model, which has been adapted to use inputs that consider features of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the sum of the discounted earnings attributable to shareholders from the first three forecast years and the terminal value, adjusted for the effect of the capital assumed to be needed over the next three years and to support growth beyond that period. The terminal value, which covers all periods beyond the third year, is calculated on the basis of the forecast of third-year profit, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, as well as the implied perpetual capital growth.\n\nThe carrying amount for each CGU is determined by reference to  the  Group's  equity  attribution  framework.  Within  this framework,  which  is  described  in  the  'Capital,  liquidity  and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report, UBS attributes equity to the businesses on the basis of their risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio denominator (both metrics include resource allocations from Group Functions to the business divisions), their goodwill and their intangible assets, as well as attributed equity related  to  certain  CET1  deduction  items.  The  framework  is primarily used for the purpose of measuring the performance of the businesses and includes certain management assumptions. Attributed equity is equal to the capital a CGU requires to conduct its business and is currently considered a reasonable approximation  of  the  carrying  amount  of  the  CGUs.  The attributed equity methodology is also applied in the business planning process, the inputs from which are used in calculating\n\nthe recoverable amounts of the respective CGU.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information about the equity attribution framework\n\n## Assumptions\n\nValuation parameters used within the Group's impairment test model  are  linked  to  external  market  information,  where applicable. The model used to determine the recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in the forecast earnings available to shareholders in years one to three, to changes in the discount rates and to changes in the long-term growth rate. The applied long-term growth rate is based on long-term economic growth rates  for  different  regions  worldwide.  Earnings  available  to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe discount rates are determined by applying a capital asset pricing model-based approach, as well as considering quantitative and qualitative inputs from both internal and external analysts and  the  view  of  management.  They  also  take  into  account regional differences in risk-free rates at the level of the individual CGUs. In line with discount rates, long-term growth rates are determined at the regional level based on nominal or real GDP growth rate forecasts.",

        "page_content": "## Note 13  Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)\n\nKey assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of each CGU are tested for sensitivity by applying a reasonably possible  change  to  those  assumptions.  Forecast  earnings available to shareholders were changed by 20%, the discount rates were changed by 1.5 percentage points, and the long-term growth rates were changed by 0.75 percentage points. Under all scenarios, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets reported  by  Global  Wealth  Management  Americas,  Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International, and Asset Management.\n\nIf the estimated earnings and other assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, the value of goodwill attributable  to  Global  Wealth  Management  Americas,  Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International, and Asset Management may become impaired in the future, giving rise to losses in the income statement. Recognition of any impairment of goodwill would reduce IFRS equity and net profit. It would not affect cash flows and, as goodwill is required to be deducted from capital under the Basel III capital framework, no effect would be expected on the Group's capital ratios.\n\n## Discount

Interest rate ranges for future interest payments related\n\nto debt issued designated at fair value have not been included in the table below, as the majority of the debt instruments issued are  structured  products  and  therefore  the  future  interest payments are highly dependent upon the embedded derivative and prevailing market conditions at the point in time that each interest payment is made.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 24 for maturity information on an undiscounted cash flow basis\n\n## Contractual maturity of carrying amount\n\n| USD million                               | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027-2031   | Thereafter   | T Toottaall   3 311..1122..2211   | Total  31.12.20   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| U UBBSS  GGrroouupp  AAGG 1 1             |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0           | 2,340        | 22,,334400                        | 1,375             |\n| U UBBSS  AAGG 2 2                         |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 4,296  | 1,658  | 716    | 495    | 226    | 273         | 1,732        | 99,,339977                        | 9,409             |\n| Floating-rate                             | 19,338 | 15,621 | 5,067  | 5,816  | 3,840  | 8,364       | 3,238        | 6611,,228844                      | 49,528            |\n| Subtotal                                  | 23,635 | 17,279 | 5,783  | 6,311  | 4,066  | 8,637       | 4,971        | 7700,,668822                      | 58,937            |\n| O Otthheerr  ssuubbssiiddiiaarriieess 3 3 |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 6      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 423         | 0            | 442299                            | 539               |\n| Floating-rate                             | 150    | 47     | 145    | 0      | 0      | 0           | 7            | 334499                            | 392               |\n| Subtotal                                  | 156    | 47     | 145    | 0      | 0      | 423         | 7            | 777788                            | 931               |\n| T Toottaall                               | 23,791 | 17,325 | 5,929  | 6,311  | 4,066  | 9,060       | 7,317        | 7733,,779999                      | 61,243            |\n\n- 1 1 Consists of instruments issued by the legal entity UBS Group AG. 2 2 Consists of instruments issued by the legal entity UBS AG. 3 3 Consists of instruments issued by subsidiaries of UBS AG.",

In  some  cases,  the  Group  applies  hedge accounting for interest rate risk as discussed in item 2j in Note 1a and Note 26. As a result of applying hedge accounting, the lifeto-date adjustment to the carrying amount of debt issued was an increase of USD 478 million as of 31 December 2021 and an increase of USD 2,401 million as of 31 December 2020, reflecting changes in fair value due to interest rate movements.\n\nSubordinated debt consists of unsecured debt obligations that are contractually subordinated in right of payment to all other present and future non-subordinated obligations of the respective\n\nissuing entity. All of the  subordinated  debt  instruments outstanding as of 31 December 2021 pay a fixed rate of interest.\n\nThe table below shows the residual contractual maturity of the carrying amount of debt issued, split between fixed-rate and floating-rate  based  on  the  contractual  terms,  and  does  not consider any early redemption features. The effects from interest rate swaps, which are used to hedge various fixed-rate debt issuances by changing the repricing characteristics into those similar to floating-rate debt, are also not considered in the table below.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 24 for maturity information on an undiscounted cash flow basis\n\n## Contractual maturity of carrying amount\n\n| USD million                               | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027-2031   | Thereafter   | T Toottaall   3 311..1122..2211   | Total  31.12.20   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| U UBBSS  GGrroouupp  AAGG 1 1             |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 3,769  | 4,027  | 5,145  | 5,052  | 6,748  | 12,534      | 3,294        | 4400,,556699                      | 33,578            |\n| Floating-rate                             | 492    | 2,183  | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0           | 0            | 22,,667766                        | 5,890             |\n| Subordinated debt                         |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0           | 13,477       | 1133,,447777                      | 14,413            |\n| Subtotal                                  | 4,261  | 6,211  | 5,145  | 5,052  | 6,748  | 12,534      | 16,771       | 5566,,772222                      | 53,881            |\n| U UBBSS  AAGG 2 2                         |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 38,647 | 5,578  | 1,964  | 349    | 3,439  | 1,381       | 1,213        | 5522,,557711                      | 52,618            |\n| Floating-rate                             | 9,807  | 2,093  | 1,922  | 907    | 508    | 0           | 0            | 1155,,223388                      | 15,299            |\n| Subordinated debt                         |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 2,020  | 0      | 2,596  | 337    | 210    | 0           | 0            | 55,,116633                        | 7,744             |\n| Subtotal                                  | 50,474 | 7,671  | 6,482  | 1,594  | 4,158  | 1,381       | 1,213        | 7722,,997722                      | 75,661            |\n| O Otthheerr  ssuubbssiiddiiaarriieess 3 3 |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Non-subordinated debt                     |        |        |        |        |        |             |              |                                   |                   |\n| Fixed-rate                                | 907    | 1,007  | 1,072  | 1,173  | 1,045  | 3,674       | 582          | 99,,446600                        | 9,690             |\n| Subtotal                                  | 907    | 1,007  | 1,072  | 1,173  | 1,045  | 3,674       | 582          | 99,,446600                        | 9,690             |\n| T Toottaall                               | 55,642 | 14,889 | 12,698 | 7,818  | 11,951 | 17,590      | 18,566       | 113399,,115555                    | 139,232           |\n\n- 1 1 Consists of debt issued by the legal entity UBS Group AG. 2 2 Consists of debt issued by the legal entity UBS AG. 3 3 Consists of debt issued by subsidiaries of UBS AG.",

Personnel-related restructuring provisions are used within a short period of time but potential changes in amount may be triggered when natural staff attrition reduces the number of people affected by a restructuring event and therefore the estimated costs. Onerous contracts for property are recognized when UBS is committed to pay for non-lease\n\n## b) Litigation, regulatory and similar matters\n\nThe Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation and similar risks arising from disputes and regulatory proceedings. As a result, UBS (which for purposes of this Note may refer to UBS Group AG and/or one or more  of  its  subsidiaries,  as  applicable)  is  involved  in  various disputes and legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration, and regulatory and criminal investigations.\n\nSuch  matters  are  subject  to  many  uncertainties,  and  the outcome and the timing of resolution are often difficult to predict, particularly in the earlier stages of a case. There are also situations where the Group may enter into a settlement agreement. This may occur in order to avoid the expense, management distraction or reputational implications of continuing to contest liability, even for those matters for which the Group believes it should be exonerated. The uncertainties inherent in all such matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both matters with respect to which provisions have been established and other contingent  liabilities.  The  Group  makes  provisions  for  such matters brought against it when, in the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is more likely than not that the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past\n\ncomponents,  such  as  utilities,  service  charges,  taxes  and maintenance, when a property is vacated or not fully recovered from sub-tenants.\n\nInformation  about  provisions  and  contingent  liabilities  in respect of litigation, regulatory and similar matters, as a class, is included in Note 18b. There are no material contingent liabilities associated with the other classes of provisions.\n\nevents, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Where these factors are otherwise satisfied, a provision may be established for claims that have not yet been asserted against the Group, but are nevertheless expected to be, based on the Group's experience with similar asserted claims. If any of those conditions is not met, such matters result in contingent liabilities. If the amount of an obligation cannot be reliably estimated, a liability exists that is not recognized  even  if  an  outflow  of  resources  is  probable. Accordingly, no provision is established even if the potential outflow  of  resources  with  respect  to  such  matters  could  be significant. Developments relating to a matter that occur after the relevant reporting period, but prior to the issuance of financial statements,  which  affect  management's  assessment  of  the provision for such matter (because, for example, the developments provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end  of  the  reporting  period),  are  adjusting  events  after  the reporting period under IAS 10 and must be recognized in the financial statements for the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Note 18  Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)\n\nSpecific litigation, regulatory and other matters are described below, including all such matters that management considers to be  material  and  others  that  management  believes  to  be  of significance due to potential financial, reputational and other effects. The amount of damages claimed, the size of a transaction or other information is provided where available and appropriate in order to assist users in considering the magnitude of potential exposures.\n\nIn the case of certain matters below, we state that we have established a provision, and for the other matters, we make no such statement. When we make this statement and we expect disclosure of the amount of a provision to prejudice seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal what UBS believes to be the probable and reliably estimable outflow, we do not disclose that amount. In some cases we are subject to confidentiality obligations that preclude such disclosure. With respect to the matters for which we do not state whether we have established a provision, either: (a) we have not established a provision, in which case the matter is treated as a contingent liability under the applicable accounting standard; or (b) we have established a provision but expect disclosure of that fact to prejudice seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal the fact that UBS believes an outflow of resources to be probable and reliably estimable.\n\nWith respect to certain litigation, regulatory and similar matters for which we have established provisions, we are able to estimate the expected timing of outflows. However, the aggregate amount of the expected outflows for those matters for which we are able to estimate expected timing is immaterial relative to our current and expected levels of liquidity over the relevant time periods.\n\nThe aggregate amount provisioned for litigation, regulatory and similar matters as a class is disclosed in the 'Provisions' table in Note 18a above. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate  of  liability  for  our  litigation,  regulatory  and  similar matters as a class of contingent liabilities. Doing so would require UBS to provide speculative legal assessments as to claims and proceedings  that  involve  unique  fact  patterns  or  novel  legal theories, that have not yet been initiated or are at early stages of adjudication, or as to which alleged damages have not been quantified  by  the  claimants.  Although  UBS  therefore  cannot provide a numerical estimate of the future losses that could arise from litigation, regulatory and similar matters, UBS believes that the aggregate amount of possible future losses from this class that are more than remote substantially exceeds the level of current provisions.\n\nLitigation, regulatory and similar matters may also result in non-monetary penalties and consequences. A guilty plea to, or conviction of, a crime could have material consequences for UBS. Resolution of regulatory proceedings may require UBS to obtain waivers  of  regulatory  disqualifications  to  maintain  certain operations, may entitle regulatory authorities to limit, suspend or terminate licenses and regulatory authorizations, and may permit financial market utilities to limit, suspend or terminate UBS's participation in such utilities. Failure to obtain such waivers, or any limitation, suspension or termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material consequences for UBS.\n\nThe risk of loss associated with litigation, regulatory and similar matters  is  a  component  of  operational  risk  for  purposes  of determining capital requirements. Information concerning our capital requirements and the calculation of operational risk for this purpose is included in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report.\n\nProvisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters by business division and in Group Functions 1\n\n| USD million                                                               | Global  Wealth  Manage- ment   | Personal &  Corporate  Banking   | Asset  Manage- ment   | Investment  Bank   | Group  Functions   | TToottaall  22002211   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| B Baallaannccee  aatt  tthhee  bbeeggiinnnniinngg  ooff  tthhee  yyeeaarr | 861                            | 115                              | 0                     | 227                | 932                | 22,,113355             |\n| Increase in provisions recognized in the income statement                 | 754                            | 84                               | 9                     | 107                | 32                 | 998866                 |\n| Release of provisions recognized in the income statement                  | (60)                           | (11)                             | 0                     | (4)                | 0                  | ((7744))               |\n| Provisions used in conformity with designated purpose                     | (175)                          | (1)                              | (1)                   | (10)               | (2)                | ((118899))             |\n| Foreign currency translation / unwind of discount                         | (42)                           | (6)                              | 0                     | (11)               | 0                  | ((5599))               |\n| B Baallaannccee  aatt  tthhee  eenndd  ooff  tthhee  yyeeaarr             | 11,,333388                     | 118811                           | 88                    | 331100             | 996622             | 22,,779988             |",

Inquiries regarding cross-border wealth management businesses\n\nTax and regulatory authorities in a number of countries have made  inquiries,  served  requests  for  information  or  examined employees located in their respective jurisdictions relating to the cross-border wealth management services provided by UBS and other financial institutions. It is possible that the implementation of  automatic  tax  information  exchange  and  other  measures relating to cross-border provision of financial services could give rise to further inquiries in the future. UBS has received disclosure orders from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration (FTA) to transfer information based on requests for international administrative assistance in tax matters. The requests concern a number of UBS account numbers pertaining to current and former clients and are based on data from 2006 and 2008. UBS has taken steps to inform  affected  clients  about  the  administrative  assistance proceedings and their procedural rights, including the right to appeal. The requests are based on data received from the German authorities, who seized certain data related to UBS clients booked in Switzerland during their investigations and have apparently shared this data with other European countries. UBS expects additional countries to file similar requests.\n\nSince 2013, UBS (France) S.A., UBS AG and certain former employees have been under investigation in France for alleged complicity in unlawful solicitation of clients on French territory, regarding the laundering of proceeds of tax fraud, and banking and financial solicitation by unauthorized persons. In connection with this investigation, the investigating judges ordered UBS AG to provide bail (' caution ') of EUR 1.1 billion and UBS (France) S.A. to post bail of EUR 40 million, which was reduced on appeal to EUR 10 million.\n\nOn 20 February 2019, the court of first instance returned a verdict finding UBS AG guilty of unlawful solicitation of clients on French territory and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud,  and  UBS  (France)  S.A.  guilty  of  aiding  and  abetting unlawful solicitation and of laundering the proceeds of tax fraud. The court imposed fines aggregating EUR 3.7 billion on UBS AG and  UBS  (France)  S.A.  and  awarded  EUR 800  million  of  civil damages to the French state. A trial in the French Court of Appeal took place in March 2021. On 13 December 2021, the Court of Appeal  found  UBS  AG  guilty  of  unlawful  solicitation  and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The court ordered  a  fine  of  EUR  3.75  million,  the  confiscation  of EUR 1 billion, and awarded civil damages to the French state of EUR 800 million. The court also found UBS (France) SA guilty of the aiding and abetting of unlawful solicitation and ordered it to pay a fine of EUR 1.875 million. UBS AG has filed an appeal with the French Supreme Court to preserve its rights. The appeal enables UBS AG to thoroughly assess the verdict of the Court of Appeal and to determine next steps in the best interest of its stakeholders. The fine and confiscation imposed by the Court of Appeal are suspended during the appeal. The civil damages award has been paid to the French state (EUR 99 million of which was deducted from the bail), subject to the result of UBS's appeal.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2021 reflected provisions with respect to this matter in an amount of EUR 1.1 billion (USD 1.252 billion at 31 December 2021). The wide range of possible outcomes in this case contributes to a high degree of estimation uncertainty and the provision reflects our best estimate of possible financial implications, although actual penalties and civil damages could exceed (or may be less than) the provision amount.\n\nIn 2016, UBS was notified by the Belgian investigating judge that it was under formal investigation (' inculp\u00e9 ') regarding the allegations of laundering of proceeds of tax fraud, banking and financial solicitation by unauthorized persons, and serious tax fraud. In November 2021, the Council Chamber approved a settlement with the Brussels Prosecution Office for EUR 49 million without recognition of guilt with regard to the allegations of banking and financial solicitation by unauthorized persons and serious tax fraud. The allegation of laundering of proceeds of tax fraud was dismissed.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2021 reflected provisions with respect to matters described in this item 1 in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove  to  be  substantially  greater  (or  may  be  less)  than  the provision that we have recognized.\n\n## 2. Claims related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and mortgages\n\nFrom 2002 through 2007, prior to the crisis in the US residential loan market, UBS was a substantial issuer and underwriter of US residential  mortgage-backed  securities  (RMBS)  and  was  a purchaser and seller of US residential mortgages.\n\nIn November 2018, the DOJ filed a civil complaint in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint seeks unspecified civil monetary  penalties under the Financial Institutions  Reform,  Recovery  and  Enforcement  Act  of  1989 related to UBS's issuance, underwriting and sale of 40 RMBS transactions in 2006 and 2007. UBS moved to dismiss the civil complaint  on  6 February  2019.  On  10 December  2019,  the district court denied UBS's motion to dismiss.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2021 reflected a provision with respect to matters described in this item 2 in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of this matter cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove  to  be  substantially  greater  (or  may  be  less)  than  the provision that we have recognized.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Madoff\n\nIn relation to the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) investment fraud, UBS AG, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. (now UBS  Europe  SE,  Luxembourg  branch)  and  certain  other  UBS subsidiaries  have  been  subject  to  inquiries  by  a  number  of regulators,  including  the  Swiss  Financial  Market  Supervisory Authority (FINMA)  and  the  Luxembourg  Commission  de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. Those inquiries concerned two third-party funds established under Luxembourg law, substantially all assets of which were with BMIS, as well as certain funds established in offshore jurisdictions with either direct or indirect exposure to BMIS. These funds faced severe losses, and the Luxembourg  funds  are  in  liquidation.  The  documentation establishing both funds identifies UBS entities in various roles, including  custodian,  administrator,  manager,  distributor  and promoter,  and  indicates  that  UBS  employees  serve  as  board members.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, the liquidators of the two Luxembourg funds filed claims against UBS entities, non-UBS entities and certain individuals, including current and former UBS employees, seeking amounts totaling approximately EUR 2.1 billion, which includes amounts that the funds may be held liable to pay the trustee for the liquidation of BMIS (BMIS Trustee).\n\nA  large  number  of  alleged  beneficiaries  have  filed  claims against UBS entities (and non-UBS entities) for purported losses relating to the Madoff fraud. The majority of these cases have been filed in Luxembourg, where decisions that the claims in eight test  cases  were  inadmissible  have  been  affirmed  by  the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and the Luxembourg Supreme Court has dismissed a further appeal in one of the test cases.\n\nIn the US, the BMIS Trustee filed claims against UBS entities, among others, in relation to the two Luxembourg funds and one of  the  offshore  funds.  The  total  amount  claimed  against  all defendants in these actions was not less than USD 2 billion. In 2014, the US Supreme Court rejected the BMIS Trustee's motion for leave to appeal decisions dismissing all claims except those for the  recovery  of  approximately  USD 125  million  of  payments alleged to be fraudulent conveyances and preference payments. In 2016, the bankruptcy court dismissed these claims against the UBS entities. In February 2019, the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the BMIS Trustee's remaining claims, and the US Supreme Court subsequently denied a petition seeking review of the Court of Appeals' decision. The case has been remanded to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings.\n\n## 4. Puerto Rico\n\nDeclines since 2013 in the market prices of Puerto Rico municipal bonds and of closed-end funds (funds) that are sole-managed and co-managed  by  UBS  Trust  Company  of  Puerto  Rico  and distributed by UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico (UBS PR) led to multiple regulatory inquiries, which in 2014 and 2015, led to settlements with the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\nSince then, UBS clients in Puerto Rico who own the funds or Puerto Rico municipal bonds and/or who used their UBS account assets as collateral for UBS non-purpose loans filed customer complaints and arbitration demands seeking aggregate damages of USD 3.4 billion, of which USD 3.1 billion have been resolved through  settlements,  arbitration  or  withdrawal  of  claims. Allegations include fraud, misrepresentation and unsuitability of the funds and of the loans.\n\nA  shareholder  derivative  action  was  filed  in  2014  against various UBS entities and current and certain former directors of the funds, alleging hundreds of millions of US dollars in losses in the funds. In 2021, the parties reached an agreement to settle this matter for USD 15 million, subject to court approval.\n\nIn 2011, a purported derivative action was filed on behalf of the Employee Retirement System of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (System) against over 40 defendants, including UBS PR, which  was  named  in  connection  with  its  underwriting  and consulting services. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants violated their purported fiduciary duties and contractual obligations in connection with the issuance and underwriting of USD 3 billion of bonds by the System in 2008 and sought damages of over USD 800 million. In 2016, the court granted the System's request to  join  the  action  as  a  plaintiff.  In  2017,  the  court  denied defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. In 2020, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.\n\nBeginning in 2015, certain agencies and public corporations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Commonwealth) defaulted on certain interest payments on Puerto Rico bonds. In 2016, US federal legislation created an oversight board with power to oversee Puerto Rico's finances and to restructure its debt. The oversight board has imposed a stay on the exercise of certain creditors' rights. In 2017, the oversight board placed certain of the  bonds  into  a  bankruptcy-like  proceeding  under  the supervision of a Federal District Judge.\n\nIn May 2019, the oversight board filed complaints in Puerto Rico federal district court bringing claims against financial, legal and  accounting  firms  that  had  participated  in  Puerto  Rico municipal bond offerings, including UBS, seeking a return of underwriting  and  swap  fees  paid  in  connection  with  those offerings. UBS estimates that it received approximately USD 125 million in fees in the relevant offerings.\n\nIn August 2019, and February and November 2020, four US insurance companies that insured issues of Puerto Rico municipal bonds sued UBS and several other underwriters of Puerto Rico municipal bonds in three separate cases. The actions collectively seek recovery of an aggregate of USD 955 million in damages from the defendants. The plaintiffs in these cases claim that defendants failed to reasonably investigate financial statements in the offering materials for the insured Puerto Rico bonds issued between 2002 and 2007, which plaintiffs argue they relied upon in agreeing to insure the bonds notwithstanding that they had no contractual  relationship  with  the  underwriters.  Defendants' motions to dismiss were granted in two of the cases; those decisions are being appealed by the plaintiffs. In the third case, defendants' motion to dismiss was denied, but on appeal that ruling was reversed and the motion to dismiss was granted.",

As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove  to  be  substantially  greater  (or  may  be  less)  than  the provisions that we have recognized.\n\n## 5. Foreign exchange, LIBOR and benchmark rates, and other trading practices\n\nForeign exchange-related regulatory matters: Beginning in 2013, numerous  authorities  commenced  investigations  concerning possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets and precious metals prices. As a result of these investigations, UBS entered into resolutions with Swiss, US and United Kingdom regulators and the  European  Commission.  UBS  was  granted  conditional immunity by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and by authorities in other jurisdictions in connection with potential competition law violations  relating  to  foreign  exchange  and  precious  metals businesses.\n\nForeign exchange-related civil litigation: Putative class actions have been filed since 2013 in US federal courts and in other jurisdictions against UBS and other banks on behalf of putative classes of persons who engaged in foreign currency transactions with any of the defendant banks. UBS has resolved US federal court class actions relating to foreign currency transactions with the defendant banks and persons who transacted in foreign exchange futures contracts and options on such futures under a settlement agreement that provides for UBS to pay an aggregate of USD 141 million and provide cooperation to the settlement classes. Certain class members have excluded themselves from that settlement and have filed individual actions in US and English courts against UBS and other banks, alleging violations of US and European competition laws and unjust enrichment.\n\nIn 2015, a putative class action was filed in federal court against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of persons and businesses in the US who directly purchased foreign currency from the defendants and alleged co-conspirators for their own end use. In March 2017, the court granted UBS's (and the other banks') motions to dismiss the complaint. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in August 2017. In March 2018, the court denied the defendants' motions to dismiss the amended complaint.\n\nLIBOR  and  other  benchmark-related  regulatory  matters: Numerous  government  agencies conducted investigations regarding potential improper attempts by UBS, among others, to manipulate LIBOR and other benchmark rates at certain times. UBS reached settlements or otherwise concluded investigations relating  to  benchmark  interest  rates  with  the  investigating authorities. UBS was granted conditional leniency or conditional immunity from authorities in certain jurisdictions, including the Antitrust  Division  of  the  DOJ  and  the  Swiss  Competition Commission (WEKO), in connection with potential antitrust or\n\ncompetition law violations related to certain rates. However, UBS has not reached a final settlement with WEKO, as the Secretariat of WEKO has asserted that UBS does not qualify for full immunity.\n\nLIBOR and other benchmark-related civil litigation: A number of putative class actions and other actions are pending in the federal courts in New York against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of parties who transacted in certain interest rate benchmark-based derivatives. Also pending in the US and in other jurisdictions are a number of other actions asserting losses related to various products whose interest rates were linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks, including adjustable rate mortgages, preferred and debt securities, bonds pledged as collateral, loans, depository accounts, investments and other interest-bearing instruments. The complaints allege manipulation, through various means, of certain benchmark interest rates, including USD LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, Yen LIBOR, EURIBOR, CHF LIBOR, GBP LIBOR, SGD SIBOR and SOR  and  Australian BBSW,  and  seek  unspecified compensatory and other damages under varying legal theories.\n\nUSD LIBOR class and individual actions in the US: In 2013 and 2015, the district court in the USD LIBOR actions dismissed, in whole  or  in  part,  certain  plaintiffs'  antitrust  claims,  federal racketeering claims, CEA claims, and state common law claims, and again dismissed the antitrust claims in 2016 following an appeal. In December 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal in part and reversed in part and remanded to the district court for further proceedings. The Second Circuit, among other things, held that there was personal jurisdiction over UBS and other foreign defendants based on allegations that at least one alleged co-conspirator undertook an overt act in the United States. Separately, in 2018, the Second Circuit reversed in part the district court's  2015  decision  dismissing  certain  individual plaintiffs' claims and certain of these actions are now proceeding. In 2018, the district court denied plaintiffs' motions for class certification in the USD class actions for claims pending against UBS, and plaintiffs sought permission to appeal that ruling to the Second  Circuit.  In  July  2018,  the  Second  Circuit  denied  the petition to appeal of the class of USD lenders and in November 2018 denied the petition of the USD exchange class. In January 2019, a putative class action was filed in the District Court for the Southern District of New York against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of US residents who, since 1 February 2014, directly transacted  with  a  defendant  bank  in  USD LIBOR instruments. The complaint asserts antitrust claims. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in August 2019. On 26 March 2020 the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal. In August 2020, an individual action was filed in the Northern District of California against UBS and numerous other banks alleging that the defendants conspired to fix the interest rate used as  the  basis  for  loans  to  consumers  by  jointly  setting  the USD LIBOR rate and monopolized the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in September 2021.",

        "page_content": "Other benchmark class actions in the US:\n\nYen LIBOR / Euroyen TIBOR In 2014, 2015 and 2017, the court in one of the Yen LIBOR / Euroyen TIBOR lawsuits dismissed certain of the plaintiffs' claims, including the plaintiffs' federal antitrust and racketeering claims. In August 2020, the court granted defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the lone remaining claim in the action as impermissibly extraterritorial.  Plaintiffs  have  appealed.  In  2017,  the  court dismissed the other Yen LIBOR / Euroyen TIBOR action in its entirety on standing grounds. In April 2020, the appeals court reversed the dismissal and in August 2020 plaintiffs in that action filed an amended complaint focused on Yen LIBOR. The court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint in September 2021 and plaintiffs and the remaining defendants have moved for reconsideration.\n\nCHF LIBOR - In 2017, the court dismissed the CHF LIBOR action on standing grounds and failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and the court granted a renewed motion to dismiss in September 2019. Plaintiffs appealed. In September 2021, the Second Circuit granted the parties' joint motion to vacate the dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings.\n\nEURIBOR - In 2017, the court in the EURIBOR lawsuit dismissed the case as to UBS and certain other foreign defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have appealed.\n\nSIBOR / SOR - In October 2018, the court in the SIBOR / SOR action dismissed all but one of plaintiffs' claims against UBS. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and the court granted a renewed motion to dismiss in July 2019. Plaintiffs appealed. In March 2021, the Second Circuit reversed the dismissal. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in October 2021, which defendants have moved to dismiss.\n\nBBSW - In November 2018, the court dismissed the BBSW lawsuit as to UBS and certain other foreign defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in April 2019, which UBS and other defendants moved to dismiss. In February 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants'  motions  to  dismiss  the  amended  complaint.  In August 2020, UBS and other BBSW defendants joined a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the court denied in May 2021.\n\nGBP LIBOR - The court dismissed the GBP LIBOR action in August 2019. Plaintiffs have appealed.\n\nGovernment bonds: Putative class actions have been filed since 2015 in US federal courts against UBS and other banks on behalf of persons who participated in markets for US Treasury securities since 2007. A consolidated complaint was filed in 2017 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the banks colluded with respect to, and manipulated prices of, US Treasury securities sold at auction and in the secondary market and asserting claims under the antitrust laws and for unjust enrichment.\n\nDefendants' motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint was granted in March 2021. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss in June 2021. Similar class actions have been filed concerning European government bonds and other government bonds.\n\nIn  May  2021,  the  European  Commission  issued  a  decision finding that UBS and six other banks breached European Union antitrust rules in 2007-2011 relating to European government bonds. The European Commission fined UBS EUR 172 million. UBS is appealing the amount of the fine.\n\nWith  respect  to  additional  matters  and  jurisdictions  not encompassed by the settlements and orders referred to above, our balance sheet at 31 December 2021 reflected a provision in an  amount  that  UBS  believes  to  be  appropriate  under  the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we have recognized.\n\n## 6. Swiss retrocessions\n\nThe Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled in 2012, in a test case  against  UBS,  that  distribution  fees  paid  to  a  firm  for distributing third-party and intra-group investment funds and structured products must be disclosed and surrendered to clients who have entered into a discretionary mandate agreement with the firm, absent a valid waiver. FINMA issued a supervisory note to all Swiss banks in response to the Supreme Court decision. UBS has met the FINMA requirements and has notified all potentially affected clients.\n\nThe Supreme Court decision has resulted, and continues to result, in a number of client requests for UBS to disclose and potentially surrender retrocessions. Client requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Considerations taken into account when assessing these cases include, among other things, the existence of  a  discretionary  mandate  and  whether  or  not  the  client documentation  contained  a  valid  waiver  with  respect  to distribution fees.\n\nOur balance sheet at 31 December 2021 reflected a provision with respect to matters described in this item 6 in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. The ultimate exposure will depend on client requests and the resolution thereof, factors that are difficult to predict and assess. Hence, as in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove  to  be  substantially  greater  (or  may  be  less)  than  the provision that we have recognized.",

An amount of USD 25 million related to the Large corporate clients segment in the Investment Bank. The remainder related to various segments in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management.\n\n## Scenario and key input updates\n\nDuring 2021, the scenarios and related macroeconomic factors were updated from those that were applied at the end of 2020 by  taking  into  account  the  prevailing  economic  and  political conditions and uncertainty. As the economic development was more positive than anticipated following the COVID-19-related downturn,  the  forward-looking  scenarios  benefited  from  an improved forecast starting level.\n\nThe projections of the baseline scenario, which are aligned to the economic and market assumptions used for UBS's business planning purposes, are broadly in line with external data, such as from  Bloomberg  Consensus,  Oxford  Economics  and  the International  Monetary  Fund  World  Economic  Outlook.  The economic  performance  during  2021  in  relevant  markets, especially in the US and in Switzerland, highlighted an accelerated improvement after the COVID-19-related shocks. The scenario assumes continued growth in 2022 in all key markets, albeit at a slower rate than seen in 2021, and unemployment rates are not expected to fall noticeably below the current levels. Interest rates are expected to remain low in line with the central bank policies pursued in the Eurozone and Switzerland, and any potential rises in the US would be limited in the foreseeable future. House prices are expected to reflect the momentum and continue to rise, especially in Switzerland and, to a lesser degree, in the US.\n\nThe narrative of the hypothetical severe downside scenario, which is the Group's binding stress scenario, has been adapted and assumes that, while the immediate risks from COVID-19 have decreased, the associated disruptions and the consequences of the unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus measures will remain critical. Concerns regarding the sustainability of public debt, following the marked deterioration of fiscal positions, lead to a loss of confidence  and  market  turbulence,  while protectionism results in a fall in global trade. Governments and central banks have limited scope to support the economies. As a consequence, the Eurozone and China suffer a hard landing, under  this  scenario  which  severely  affects  the  Swiss  exportoriented  economy,  and  the  US  economy  contracts  as  global demand  is  significantly  affected.  Given  the  severity  of  the macroeconomic impact, unemployment rates rise to historical highs and real estate sectors contract sharply.\n\nWith effect from the second quarter, the hypothetical upside and mild downside scenarios, which were viewed as less plausible as of 31 December 2020 and had a probability weight of zero attached,  were  redesigned  and  reintroduced  in  the  ECL calculation. These two scenarios have become more relevant following  this  update,  as  they  better  reflect  a  more  positive outlook  with  regard  to  COVID-19  and  market  expectations regarding a potential change in central bank policies, respectively.\n\nThe  upside  scenario  is  based  on  positive  developments following COVID-19 and strong economic activity supported by pent-up demand in certain sectors, as well as the expectation that interest rates will remain relatively low in the near future. Asset prices rise significantly, but a view that currently observed higher inflation rates are temporary and spare economic capacity would mean that consumer prices remain moderate in the first year of the scenario.\n\nThe mild downside scenario focuses on the implications of rising concerns regarding inflationary trends following a recovery from COVID-19. Higher-than-expected inflation data triggers a steepening of yield curves across the globe and leads to market volatility. Higher interest rates lead to a sell-off in assets and a period  of  deleveraging  under  this  scenario.  With  inflation remaining high, central banks start hiking their policy rates after a few quarters, leading to further increases in interest rates and impacting corporate and private debt sustainability. A recessionary period is the consequence.\n\nThe table on the following page details the key assumptions for the four scenarios applied as of 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Scenario weights and post-model adjustments\n\nWith the weighting of four scenarios above 0% and considering the generally more positive outlook regarding an abating effect on  the  world  economy  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the distribution of weights shifted during 2021. As of 31 December 2021, 5 percentage points of the weight of the baseline scenario and 10 percentage points of the severe downside scenario were redistributed to the upside scenario (5%) and the mild downside scenario (10%), as shown in the table below.\n\nAlthough the scenarios and weight allocation were established in line with the general market sentiment that COVID-19 has passed its peak and a gradual return to normal is the most likely path, significant uncertainties still remain. Models, which are based on supportable statistical information from past experiences  regarding  interdependencies  of  macroeconomic factors and their implications for credit risk portfolios, cannot comprehensively reflect extraordinary events, such as a pandemic or a fundamental change in the world political order. Especially in these uncertain times, it is in the realm of possibilities that the generally accepted view that the effects of COVID-19 are abating may prove to be disappointed by the emergence of new variants of the virus, which may be more harmful and may undermine current  vaccination  efforts.  Political  events  involving  tensions between  major  global  forces  may  introduce  unforeseen challenges, such as disruptions in the global supply chain and a\n\ndistortion of energy markets. Such events could affect economies severely and change the baseline assumptions significantly. Rather than creating multiple additional scenarios to gauge these risks and applying model parameters that lack supportable information and cannot be robustly validated, management continued to apply  significant  post-model  adjustments.  These  adjustments were benchmarked against coverage ratio levels as of 30 June 2021,  when  a  partial  net  release  of  USD 91  million  was recognized, corresponding to one third of the accumulated effect of  scenario  improvements,  following  comprehensive  expert assessment and judgment, and were also deemed appropriate for year-end 2021 reporting. The post-model adjustments relating to COVID-19 amounted to USD 224 million as of 31 December 2021 (2020: USD 117 million in addition to overlays of USD 16 million for  other  aspects,  where  model

recognized in the period are impacted by a variety of factors, such as:\n\n- -origination of new instruments during the period;\n- -effect of passage of time as the ECLs on an instrument for the remaining lifetime decrease (all other factors remaining the same);\n- -discount unwind within ECLs as it is measured on a present value basis;\n- -derecognition of instruments in the period;\n- -change in individual asset quality of instruments;\n- -effect of updating  forward-looking  scenarios  and  the respective weights;\n\n- -movements from a maximum 12-month ECL to the recognition of lifetime ECLs (and vice versa) following transfers between stages 1 and 2;\n- -movements from stages 1 and 2 to stage 3 (credit-impaired status) when default has become certain and PD increases to 100% (or vice versa);\n- -changes in models or updates to model parameters;\n- -write-off; and\n- -foreign  exchange  translations  for  assets  denominated  in foreign currencies and other movements.",

decrease in allowances and provisions resulting from financial instruments (including guarantees and facilities) that were newly originated, purchased or renewed and from the final derecognition of loans or facilities on their maturity date or earlier. 2 2 Represents the remeasurement between 12-month and lifetime ECL due to stage transfers. 3 3 Represents the change in allowances and provisions related to changes in model inputs or assumptions, including changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions, changes in the exposure profile, PD and LGD changes, and unwinding of the time value. 4 4 Represents the change in the allowances and provisions related to changes in models and methodologies. 5 5 Includes ECL movements from new and derecognized transactions, remeasurement changes, model and methodology changes. 6 6 Represents the decrease in allowances and provisions resulting from write-offs of the ECL allowance against the gross carrying amount when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven and movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn 2021, ECL allowances and provisions decreased by USD 148 million from net credit loss releases impacting profit or loss:\n\n- -a USD 59 million net increase from new and derecognized transactions  that  resulted  from  a  USD 72  million  stage 1 increase primarily in the corporate lending and real estate lending portfolio, offset by a USD 13 million net release from stage 2 positions, driven by positions that were terminated before their contractual maturity;\n- -a USD 163 million net decrease from book quality movements that  resulted  from  a  USD 203  million  net  decrease  from remeasurements without stage transfers, with approximately half of that related to corporate lending - another significant portion related to real estate-related lending, primarily due to the partial release of a post-model adjustment, partially offset\n\nby USD 40 million from transactions moving from stages 1 and 2 into stages 2 and 3, respectively, primarily related to SME clients; and\n\n- -a USD 45 million net decrease that resulted from a number of model changes.  An amount of USD 25 million related to the Large corporate clients segment in the Investment Bank. The remainder related to various segments in Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  movements  impacting  profit  or  loss, allowances decreased by USD 154 million as a result of USD 137 million of write-offs and USD 18 million from foreign exchange and other movements, both of which did not impact the income statement.",

the final derecognition of loans or facilities on their maturity date or earlier. 2 2 Represents the remeasurement between 12-month and lifetime ECL due to stage transfers. 3 3 Represents the change in allowances and provisions related to changes in model inputs or assumptions, including changes in forward-looking macroeconomic conditions, changes in the exposure profile, PD and LGD changes, and unwinding of the time value. 4 4 Represents the change in the allowances and provisions related to changes in models and methodologies. 5 5 Includes ECL movements from new and derecognized transactions, remeasurement changes, model and methodology changes. 6 6 Represents the decrease in allowances and provisions resulting from write-offs of the ECL allowance against the gross carrying amount when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible or forgiven and movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\nAs explained in Note 1a, the assessment of a significant increase in  credit  risk  (SICR)  considers  a  number  of  qualitative  and quantitative  factors  to  determine  whether  a  stage  transfer between stage 1 and stage 2 is required, although the primary\n\nassessment considers changes in PD based on rating analyses and economic  outlook.  Additionally,  UBS  takes  into  consideration counterparties that have moved to a credit watch list and those with payments that are at least 30 days past due.\n\nECL stage 2 ('significant deterioration in credit risk') allowances / provisions as of 31 December 2021 - classification by trigger\n\n| USD million                                        | S Sttaaggee  22   | of which:  PD layer   | of which:  watch list   | of which:  \u226530  days  past due   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| On-and off-balance sheet                           | (220)             | (158)                 | (22)                    | (39)                             |\n| of which: Private clients with mortgages           | (71)              | (54)                  | 0                       | (17)                             |\n| of which: Real estate financing                    | (43)              | (38)                  | 0                       | (4)                              |\n| of which: Large corporate clients                  | (55)              | (40)                  | (15)                    | 0                                |\n| of which: SME clients                              | (30)              | (19)                  | (7)                     | (4)                              |\n| of which: Financial intermediaries and hedge funds | (6)               | (6)                   | 0                       | 0                                |\n| of which: Loans to financial advisors              | (3)               | 0                     | 0                       | (3)                              |\n| of which: Credit cards                             | (11)              | 0                     | 0                       | (11)                             |\n| of which: Other                                    | (1)               | (1)                   | 0                       | 0                                |",

Where information is available, collateral is\n\npresented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security. The 'Risk management and control' section of this report describes management's view of credit risk and the related exposures, which can differ in certain respects from the requirements of IFRS.\n\n##

off-balance sheet financial instruments and credit lines for credit-impaired positions. 2 2 Collateral arrangements generally incorporate a range of collateral, including cash, securities, real estate and other collateral. UBS applies a risk-based approach that generally prioritizes collateral according to its liquidity profile. 3 3 Includes but is not limited to life insurance contracts, inventory, mortgage loans, gold and other commodities. 4 4 Loans and advances to banks include amounts held with third-party banks on behalf of clients. The credit risk associated with these balances may be borne by those clients. 5 5 Included within Cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments are margin balances due from exchanges or clearing houses. Some of these margin balances reflect amounts transferred on behalf of clients who retain the associated credit risk. 6 6 The amount shown in the 'Netting' column represents the netting potential not recognized on the balance sheet. Refer to Note 22 for more information. 7 7 In 2021, the collateral allocation was updated to reflect additional cash collateral and custody accounts that are also available as security for certain on-balance sheet lending. This resulted in an increase in loans secured by cash, with an offsetting reduction in loans secured by real estate and loans secured by securities. 8 8 The amount shown in the 'Guarantees' column includes sub-participations.",

The risk sensitivities for each of the ECL reporting segments to such factors are summarized in Note 9.\n\n## Forward-looking scenarios\n\nDepending on the scenario selection and related macro-economic assumptions for the risk factors, the components of the relevant weighted average ECL change. This is particularly relevant for\n\ninterest rates, which can move in both directions under a given growth assumption (for example, low growth with high interest rates in a stagflation scenario, versus low growth and falling interest rates in a recession). Management generally looks for scenario narratives that reflect the key risk drivers of a given credit portfolio.\n\nAs forecasting models are complex, due to the combination of multiple factors, simple what-if analyses involving a change of individual parameters  do  not  necessarily  provide  realistic information on the exposure of segments to changes in the macroeconomy. Portfolio-specific analyses based on their key risk factors would also not be meaningful, as potential compensatory effects in other segments would be ignored. The table below indicates  some  sensitivities  to  ECLs  if  a  key  macroeconomic variable for the forecasting period is amended across all scenarios with all other factors remaining unchanged.\n\nPotential effect on stage 1 and stage 2 positions from changing key parameters as of 31 December 2021\n\n| USD million

The table on the previous page outlines favorable and unfavorable effects, based on reasonably possible alternative changes to the economic conditions for stage 1 and stage 2  positions.  The  ECL  impact  is  calculated  for  material portfolios and disclosed for each scenario.\n\nThe forecasting horizon is limited to three years, with a model-based  mean  reversion  of  PD  and  LGD  assumed thereafter. Changes to these timelines may have an effect on ECLs: depending on the cycle, a longer or shorter forecasting horizon will lead to different annualized lifetime PD and average LGD estimations. This is currently not deemed to be material for UBS, as a large proportion of loans, including mortgages in Switzerland, have maturities that are within the forecasting horizon.\n\n## Scenario weights\n\nECL is sensitive to changing scenario weights, in particular if narratives and parameters are selected that are not close to the baseline scenario, highlighting the non-linearity of credit losses.\n\nAs shown in the table on the bottom of this page, the ECL for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 387 million  (31 December  2020:  USD 442  million)  instead  of USD 503 million (31 December 2020: USD 639 million) if ECL had  been  determined  solely  on  the  baseline  scenario.  The weighted average ECL therefore amounts to 130% (31 December 2020: 145%) of the baseline value. The effects of weighting each of the four scenarios 100% are shown in the table below.\n\n## Stage allocation and SICR\n\nThe  determination  of  what  constitutes  an  SICR  is  based  on management judgment, as explained in Note 1a. Changing the SICR trigger will have a direct effect on ECLs, as more or fewer positions would be subject to lifetime ECLs under any scenario.\n\nThe  relevance  of  the  SICR  trigger  on  overall  ECL  is demonstrated in the table below with the indication that the ECL allowances and provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 1,060 million if all non-impaired positions across  the  portfolio  had  been  measured  for  lifetime  ECLs irrespective of their actual SICR status. This amount compares to actual stage 1 and 2 allowances and provisions of USD 503 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nPotential effect on stage 1 and stage 2 positions from changing scenario weights or moving to an ECL lifetime calculation as of 31 December 2021\n\n| Scenarios USD million, except where indicated   | Actual ECL  allowances and  provisions,  including staging  (as per Note 9)   |                             | Pro forma ECL allowances and provisions, including staging  and assuming application of 100% scenario weighting   |                                         | Pro forma ECL

              |\n\n## Maturity profile\n\nThe maturity profile is an important driver for changes in ECL due to transfers to stage 2 and from stage 2 to stage 1. The current maturity profile of most lending books is relatively short; hence a movement to stage 2 may have a moderate effect on ECLs. A significant portion of our lending to SMEs is documented under multi-purpose credit agreements, which allow for various forms of utilization but are unconditionally cancelable by UBS at any time. For drawings under such agreements with a fixed maturity,\n\nthe respective term is applied for ECL calculations, or a maximum of 12 months in stage 1. For unused credit lines and all drawings that have no fixed maturity (e.g., current accounts), UBS generally applies a 12-month maturity from the reporting date, given the credit review policies, which require either continuous monitoring of key indicators and behavioral patterns for smaller positions or an annual formal review for any other limit. The ECLs for these products are sensitive to shortening or extending the maturity assumption.",

        "page_content": "## Note 21  Fair value measurement\n\n## a) Valuation principles\n\nAll financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorized into one of three fair value hierarchy levels in accordance with IFRS. The fair value hierarchy is based on the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, the level in the hierarchy within which an instrument is classified in its entirety is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the position's fair value measurement:\n\n- -Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;\n- -Level 2 - valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are, or are based on, observable market data; or\n- -Level 3 - valuation techniques for which significant inputs are not based on observable market data.\n\n## b) Valuation governance\n\nUBS's fair value measurement and model governance framework includes numerous controls and other procedural safeguards that are intended to maximize the quality of fair value measurements reported in the financial statements. New products and valuation techniques must be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders from the risk and finance control functions. Responsibility for the ongoing measurement of financial and non-financial instruments at fair value is with the business divisions.\n\nFair  values  are  determined  using  quoted  prices  in  active markets for identical assets or liabilities, where available. Where the market for a financial instrument or non-financial asset or liability is not active, fair value is established using a valuation technique, including pricing models. Valuation adjustments may be made to allow for additional factors, including model, liquidity, credit and funding risks, which are not explicitly captured within the  valuation  technique,  but  which  would  nevertheless  be considered by market participants when establishing a price. The limitations  inherent  in  a  particular  valuation  technique  are considered in the determination of the classification of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy. Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual instrument, and UBS applies valuation adjustments at an individual instrument level, consistent with that unit of account. However, if certain conditions are met, UBS may estimate the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and liabilities with substantially similar and offsetting risk exposures on the basis of the net open risks.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 21d for more information\n\nFair  value  estimates  are  validated  by  the  risk  and  finance control  functions,  which  are  independent  of  the  business divisions. Independent price verification is performed by Finance through benchmarking the business divisions' fair value estimates with observable market prices and other independent sources. A governance framework and associated controls are in place in order to monitor the quality of third-party pricing sources where used.  For  instruments  where  valuation  models  are  used  to determine fair value, independent valuation and model control groups within Finance and Risk Control evaluate UBS's models on a regular basis, including valuation and model input parameters, as well as pricing. As a result of the valuation controls employed, valuation adjustments may be made to the business divisions' estimates of fair value to align with independent market data and the relevant accounting standard.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 21d for more information",

The most frequently applied valuation techniques include discounted value of expected cash flows, relative value and option pricing methodologies.\n\nDiscounted  value  of  expected  cash  flows  is  a  valuation technique that measures fair value using estimated expected future cash flows from assets or liabilities and then discounts these cash flows using a discount rate or discount margin that reflects the credit and / or funding spreads required by the market for instruments with similar risk and liquidity profiles to produce a present value. When using such valuation techniques, expected future cash flows are estimated using an observed or implied market price for the future cash flows or by using industrystandard cash flow projection models. The discount factors within the calculation are generated using industry-standard yield curve modeling techniques and models.\n\nRelative value models measure fair value based on the market prices of equivalent or comparable assets or liabilities, making adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the observed instrument and the instrument being valued.\n\nOption pricing models incorporate assumptions regarding the behavior of future price movements of an underlying referenced asset or assets to generate a probability-weighted future expected payoff  for  the  option.  The  resulting  probability-weighted expected  payoff  is  then  discounted  using  discount  factors generated from industry-standard yield curve modeling\n\ntechniques  and  models.  The  option  pricing  model  may  be implemented using a closed-form analytical formula or other mathematical techniques (e.g., binomial tree or Monte Carlo simulation).\n\nWhere available, valuation techniques use market-observable assumptions and inputs. If such data is not available, inputs may be derived by reference to similar assets in active markets, from recent  prices  for  comparable  transactions  or  from  other observable market data. In such cases, the inputs selected are based  on  historical  experience  and  practice  for  similar  or analogous instruments, derivation of input levels based on similar products with observable price levels, and knowledge of current market conditions and valuation approaches.\n\nFor more complex instruments, fair values may be estimated using a combination of observed transaction prices, consensus pricing services and relevant quotes. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recently  evidenced  market  activity  to  the  prices  provided  by consensus  pricing  services.  UBS  also  uses  internally  developed models,  which  are  typically  based  on  valuation  methods  and techniques recognized as standard within the industry. Assumptions  and  inputs  used  in  valuation  techniques  include benchmark interest rate curves, credit and funding spreads used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, equity index prices,  foreign  exchange  rates,  levels  of  market  volatility  and correlation. Refer to Note 21f for more information. The discount curves used by the Group incorporate the funding and credit characteristics of the instruments to which they are applied.\n\n## Financial instruments excluding derivatives: valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy\n\n| Product                                         | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy   | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Government bills  and bonds                     | Valuation                                                  | -

These collateral arrangements differ across counterparties with respect to the eligible currency and interest terms of the collateral. The majority of collateralized derivatives are measured using a discount curve based on funding rates derived from overnight interest in the cheapest eligible currency for the respective counterparty collateral agreement.\n\nUncollateralized  and  partially  collateralized  derivatives  are discounted using the alternative reference rate (the ARR) (or equivalent) curve for the currency of the instrument. As described in  Note  21d,  the  fair  value  of  uncollateralized  and  partially collateralized  derivatives  is  then  adjusted  by  credit  valuation adjustments  (CVAs),  debit  valuation  adjustments  (DVAs)  and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs), as applicable, to reflect an estimation of the effect of counterparty credit risk, UBS's own credit risk, and funding costs and benefits.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 10 for more information about derivative instruments\n\n| Derivative product           | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy   | Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate  contracts     | Valuation                                                  | - Interest rate swap contracts are valued by estimating future interest cash flows and discounting those cash  flows using a rate that reflects the appropriate funding rate for the position being measured. The yield  curves used to estimate future index levels and discount rates are generated using market-standard yield  curve models using interest rates associated with current market activity. The key inputs to the models are  interest rate swap rates, forward rate agreement rates, short-term interest rate futures prices, basis swap  spreads and inflation swap rates. - Interest rate option contracts are valued using various market-standard option models, using inputs that  include interest rate yield curves, inflation curves, volatilities and correlations. - When the maturity of an interest rate swap or option contract exceeds the term for which standard market |\n|                              | Fair value hierarchy                                       | - The majority of interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2, as the standard market contracts that form the  inputs for yield curve models are generally traded in active and observable markets. - Options are generally treated as Level 2, as the calibration process enables the model output to be validated  to active-market levels.

Where a derivative credit spread is not directly  available, it may be derived from the price of the reference cash bond.  - Asset-backed credit derivatives are valued using a valuation technique similar to that of the underlying  security with an adjustment to reflect the funding differences between cash and synthetic form.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |",

This presentation does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income statement, as the Group does not hedge changes in own credit.\n\nOwn credit is estimated using own credit adjustment (OCA) curves,  which  incorporate  observable  market  data,  including market-observed secondary prices for UBS's debt, UBS's credit default swap spreads and debt curves of peers. In the table below, the change in unrealized own credit consists of changes in fair value that are attributable to the change in UBS's credit spreads, as well as the effect of changes in fair values attributable to factors other than credit spreads, such as redemptions, effects from time decay and changes in interest and other market rates. Realized own credit is recognized when an instrument with an associated unrealized OCA is repurchased prior to the contractual maturity  date.  Life-to-date  amounts  reflect  the  cumulative unrealized change since initial recognition.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 16 for more information about debt issued designated at fair value",

This amount represents the estimated fair value of protection required to hedge the counterparty credit risk of such instruments.  A  CVA  is  determined  for  each  counterparty, considering  all  exposures  with  that  counterparty,  and  is dependent on the expected future value of exposures, default probabilities and recovery rates, applicable collateral or netting arrangements,  break  clauses,  funding  spreads,  and  other contractual factors.\n\n## Funding valuation adjustments\n\nFVAs reflect the costs and benefits of funding associated with uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivative receivables and payables and are calculated as the valuation effect from moving the discounting of the uncollateralized derivative cash flows from the ARR to OCA using the CVA framework, including the probability of counterparty default. An FVA is also applied to collateralized derivative assets in cases where the collateral cannot be sold or repledged.\n\n## Debit valuation adjustments\n\nA DVA is estimated to incorporate own credit in the valuation of derivatives where an FVA is not already recognized. The DVA calculation is effectively consistent with the CVA framework, being  determined  for  each  counterparty,  considering  all exposures  with  that  counterparty  and  taking  into  account collateral netting agreements, expected future mark-to-market movements and UBS's credit default spreads.\n\n## Other valuation adjustments\n\nInstruments that are measured as part of a portfolio of combined long and short positions are valued at mid-market levels to ensure consistent valuation of the long- and short-component risks. A liquidity valuation adjustment is then made to the overall net long or short exposure to move the fair value to bid or offer as appropriate, reflecting current levels of market liquidity. The bidoffer spreads used in the calculation of this valuation adjustment are obtained from market transactions and other relevant sources and are updated periodically.\n\nUncertainties  associated  with  the  use  of  model-based valuations are incorporated into the measurement of fair value through the use of model reserves. These reserves reflect the amounts that the Group estimates should be deducted from valuations produced directly by models to incorporate uncertainties in the relevant modeling assumptions, in the model and market inputs used, or in the calibration of the model output to  adjust  for  known  model  deficiencies.  In  arriving  at  these estimates,  the  Group  considers  a  range  of  market  practices, including how it believes market participants would assess these uncertainties. Model reserves are reassessed periodically in light of data from market transactions, consensus pricing services and other relevant sources.\n\n## Other items\n\nIn the first half of 2021, UBS incurred a loss of USD 861 million as a result of closing out a significant portfolio of swaps with a US-based  client  of  its  prime  brokerage  business  and  the unwinding of related hedges, following the client's default. This loss  is  presented  within Other  net  income  from  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss .\n\n## Valuation adjustments on financial instruments\n\n|                                                               | As of             | As of    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Life-to-date gain / (loss), USD million                       | 3 311..1122..2211 | 31.12.20 |\n| C Crreeddiitt  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss 1 1 | ( (4444))         | (66)     |\n| F Fuunnddiinngg  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss   | ( (4499))         | (73)     |\n| D Deebbiitt  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss       | 2 2               | 0        |\n| OOtthheerr  vvaalluuaattiioonn  aaddjjuussttmmeennttss        | ( (991133))       | (820)    |\n| of which: liquidity                                           | ( (334411))       | (340)    |\n| of which: model uncertainty                                   | ( (557711))       | (479)    |\n\n- 1 1 Amounts do not include reserves against defaulted counterparties.",

Therefore, the range does not reflect the level of uncertainty regarding a particular input or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Group's estimates\n\nand assumptions, but rather the different underlying characteristics of the relevant assets and liabilities held by the Group. The ranges will therefore vary from period to period and parameter  to  parameter  based  on  characteristics  of  the instruments held at each balance sheet date. Furthermore, the ranges of unobservable inputs may differ across other financial institutions, reflecting the diversity of the products in each firm's inventory.\n\nValuation techniques and inputs

Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include credit quality, maturity and industry of  the issuer. Fair value may be measured either by a direct price comparison or by conversion of an instrument price into a yield  (either as an outright yield or as a spread to the relevant benchmark rate).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Loan price equivalent | - Where market prices are not available for a traded loan, fair value is measured by comparison with observable pricing data for  similar instruments. Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include industry segment, collateral quality,  maturity and issuer-specific covenants. Fair value may be measured either by a direct price comparison or by conversion of an  instrument price into a yield. The range represents the range of prices derived from reference issuances of a similar credit  quality used to measure fair value for loans classified as Level 3. Loans priced at 0 are distressed to the point that no recovery                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Credit spread         | - Valuation models for many credit derivatives require an input for the credit spread, which is a reflection of the credit quality of  the associated referenced underlying. The credit spread of a particular security is quoted in relation to the yield on a benchmark  security or reference rate, typically either US Treasury or ARR, and is generally expressed in terms of basis points. An increase /  (decrease) in credit spread will increase / (decrease) the value of credit protection offered by credit default swaps and other  credit derivative products. The income statement effect from such changes depends on the nature and direction of the positions  held. Credit spreads may be negative where the asset is more creditworthy than the benchmark against which the spread is  calculated. A wider credit spread represents decreasing creditworthiness. The range represents a diverse set of underlyings,  with the lower end of the range representing credits of the highest quality and the upper end of the range representing greater  levels of credit risk.                                                                                                       |\n| Funding spread        | - Structured financing transactions are valued using synthetic funding curves that best represent the assets that are pledged as  collateral for the transactions. They are not representative of where UBS can fund itself on an unsecured basis, but provide an  estimate of where UBS can source and deploy secured funding with counterparties for a given type of collateral. The funding  spreads are expressed in terms of basis points, and if funding spreads widen, this increases the effect of discounting.  - A small proportion of structured debt instruments and non-structured fixed-rate bonds within financial liabilities designated at  fair value had an exposure to funding spreads that was longer in duration than the actively traded market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Volatility            | - Volatility measures the variability of future prices for a particular instrument and is generally expressed as a percentage, where  a higher number reflects a more volatile instrument, for which future price movements are more likely to occur. Volatility is a  key input into option models, where it is used to derive a probability-based distribution of future prices for the underlying  instrument. The effect of volatility on individual positions within the portfolio is driven primarily by whether the option contract  is a long or short position. In most cases, the fair value of an option increases as a result of an increase in volatility and is  reduced by a decrease in volatility. Generally, volatility used in the measurement of fair value is derived from active-market  option prices (referred to as implied volatility). A key feature of implied volatility is the volatility 'smile' or 'skew,' which  represents the effect of pricing options of different option strikes at different implied volatility levels. - Volatilities of low interest rates tend to be much higher than volatilities of high interest rates.

It is expressed as a percentage between  -100% and +100%, where +100% represents perfectly correlated variables (meaning a movement of one variable is associated  with a movement of the other variable in the same direction) and -100% implies that the variables are inversely correlated  (meaning a movement of one variable is associated with a movement of the other variable in the opposite direction). The effect  of correlation on the measurement of fair value depends on the specific terms of the instruments being valued, reflecting the  range of different payoff features within such instruments. - Equity-to-FX correlation is important for equity options based on a currency other than the currency of the underlying stock.  Equity-to-equity correlation is particularly important for complex options that incorporate, in some manner, different equities  in the projected payoff. |\n| Equity dividend yields | - The derivation of a forward price for an individual stock or index is important for measuring fair value for forward or swap  contracts and for measuring fair value using option pricing models. The relationship between the current stock price and the  forward price is based on a combination of expected future dividend levels and payment timings, and, to a lesser extent, the  relevant funding rates applicable to the stock in question. Dividend yields are generally expressed as an annualized percentage  of the share price, with the lowest limit of 0% representing a stock that is not expected to pay any dividend. The dividend yield  and timing represent the most significant parameter in determining fair value for instruments that are sensitive to an equity  forward price.                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\n## g) Level 3 instruments: sensitivity to changes in unobservable input assumptions\n\nThe table below summarizes those financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 for which a change in one or more of the unobservable inputs to reflect reasonably possible favorable and unfavorable  alternative  assumptions  would  change  fair  value significantly, and the estimated effect thereof. The table below does  not  represent  the  estimated  effect  of  stress  scenarios. Interdependencies between Level 1, 2 and 3 parameters have not been  incorporated  in  the  table.  Furthermore,  direct  interrelationships between the Level 3 parameters discussed below are not a significant element of the valuation uncertainty.\n\nSensitivity data is estimated using a number of techniques, including  the  estimation  of  price  dispersion  among  different market  participants,  variation  in  modeling  approaches  and\n\nreasonably possible changes to assumptions used within the fair value measurement process. The sensitivity ranges are not always symmetrical  around  the  fair  values,  as  the  inputs  used  in valuations are not always precisely in the middle of the favorable and unfavorable range.\n\nSensitivity data is determined at a product or parameter level and  then  aggregated  assuming  no  diversification  benefit. Diversification would incorporate estimated correlations across different sensitivity results and, as such, would result in an overall sensitivity that would be less than the sum of the individual component sensitivities. However, the Group believes that the diversification benefit is not significant to this analysis.\n\nSensitivity of fair value measurements to changes in unobservable input assumptions 1\n\n|                                                                               | 3 311..1122..2211                     | 3 311..1122..2211                         | 31.12.20           | 31.12.20             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| USD million                                                                   | F Faavvoorraabbllee   c chhaannggeess | U Unnffaavvoorraabbllee   c chhaannggeess | Favorable  changes | Unfavorable  changes |\n| Traded loans, loans designated at fair value, loan commitments and guarantees | 1199                                  | ((1133))                                  | 29                 | (28)                 |\n| Securities financing transactions                                             | 4411                                  | ((5533))                                  | 40                 | (52)                 |\n| Auction rate securities                                                       | 6666 2 2                              | ((6666)) 2 2                              | 105                | (105)                |\n| Asset-backed securities                                                       | 2200                                  | ((2200))                                  | 41                 | (41)                 |\n| Equity instruments                                                            | 117733                                | ((114466))                                | 129                | (96)                 |\n| Interest rate derivative contracts, net                                       | 2299                                  | ((1199))                                  | 11                 | (16)                 |\n| Credit derivative contracts, net                                              | 55                                    | ((88))                                    | 10                 | (14)                 |\n| Foreign exchange derivative contracts, net                                    | 1199                                  | ((1111))                                  | 20                 | (15)                 |\n| Equity / index derivative contracts, net                                      | 336688                                | ((333355))                                | 318                | (294)                |\n| Other                                                                         | 5500                                  | ((7733))                                  | 91                 | (107)                |\n| T Toottaall                                                                   | 779900                                | ((774444))                                | 794                | (768)                |",

Where information is available, collateral is\n\npresented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security.

 purposes  only.  The  valuation  techniques  and assumptions described below relate only to the fair value of UBS's financial instruments not measured at fair value. Other institutions may use different methods and assumptions for their fair value estimations,  and  therefore  such  fair  value  disclosures  cannot necessarily be compared from one financial institution to another. The following principles were applied when determining fair value estimates for financial instruments not measured at fair value:\n\n- -For financial instruments with remaining maturities greater than three months, the fair value was determined from quoted market prices, if available.\n- -Where quoted market prices were not available, the fair values were estimated by discounting contractual cash flows using current market interest rates or appropriate yield curves for instruments  with  similar  credit  risk  and  maturity.  These estimates generally include adjustments for counterparty credit risk or UBS's own credit.\n- -For short-term financial instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less, the carrying amount, which is net of credit loss allowances, is generally considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.",

These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set off liabilities against available assets received in the ordinary course of business and / or in the event that the counterparties to the transaction are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations.\n\nThe tables on this page and the next page provide a summary of financial assets and financial liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements, as well as financial collateral received or pledged to mitigate credit exposures for these financial instruments.\n\nThe Group engages in a variety of counterparty credit risk mitigation  strategies  in  addition  to  netting  and  collateral arrangements.

daily basis either legally or in substance under IAS 32 principles and exchange-traded derivatives that are economically settled on a daily basis. 2 2 The logic of the table results in amounts presented in the 'Netting with gross assets' column corresponding to the amounts presented in the 'Netting with gross liabilities' column in the assets table presented on the previous page. Netting in this column for repurchase agreements presented within the lines 'Payables from securities financing transactions' and 'Other financial liabilities designated at fair value' taken together corresponds to the amounts presented for reverse repurchase agreements in the 'Receivables from securities financing transactions' and 'Financial assets at fair value not held for trading' lines in the assets table presented on the previous page. 3 3 For the purpose of this disclosure, the amounts of financial instruments and cash collateral presented have been capped so as not to exceed the net amount of financial liabilities presented on the balance sheet; i.e., over-collateralization, where it exists, is not reflected in the table. 4 4 Includes liabilities not subject to enforceable netting arrangements and other out-of-scope items.",

The  Group  generally  enters  into repurchase and securities lending arrangements under standard market agreements. For securities lending, the cash received as collateral may be more or less than the fair value of the securities loaned,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  For repurchase agreements, the fair value of the collateral sold under an agreement to repurchase is generally in excess of the cash\n\n## Restricted financial assets\n\nborrowed. Pledged mortgage loans serve as collateral for existing liabilities  against  Swiss  central  mortgage  institutions  and  for existing covered bond issuances of USD 10,843 million as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: USD 12,456 million).\n\nOther restricted financial assets include assets protected under client  asset  segregation  rules,  assets  held  by  the  Group's insurance entities to back related liabilities to the policy holders, assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with explicit minimum local asset maintenance requirements. The carrying amount of the liabilities associated with these other restricted financial assets is generally equal to the carrying amount of the assets, with the exception of assets held to comply with local asset maintenance requirements, for which the associated liabilities are greater.\n\n| USD million                                                                                   | 3

Supervisory authorities  also  may  require  entities  to  measure  capital  and leverage ratios on a stressed basis, such as the Federal Reserve Board's  Comprehensive  Capital  Analysis  and  Review  process, which  may  limit  the  relevant  subsidiaries'  ability  to  make distributions of capital based on the results of those tests.\n\nSupervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher  requirements  or  to  otherwise  limit  the  activities  of subsidiaries.\n\nNon-regulated subsidiaries are generally not subject to such requirements and transfer restrictions. However, restrictions can also be the result of different legal, regulatory, contractual, entityor country-specific arrangements and / or requirements.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Financial and

financial  assets  are  transferred,  but continue to be recognized in their entirety on UBS's balance sheet include securities lending and repurchase agreements, as well as other financial asset transfers. Repurchase and securities lending arrangements are, for the most part, conducted under standard market  agreements  and  are  undertaken  with  counterparties subject to UBS's normal credit risk control processes.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 2e for more information about repurchase and securities lending agreements\n\nAs  of  31  December  2021,  approximately  41%  of  the transferred  financial assets were  assets  held  for  trading transferred in exchange for cash, in which case the associated recognized  liability  represents  the  amount  to  be  repaid  to counterparties. For securities lending and repurchase agreements, a haircut of between 0% and 15% is generally applied to the transferred assets, which results in associated liabilities having a carrying amount below the carrying amount of the transferred assets. The counterparties to the associated liabilities presented in the table above have full recourse to UBS.\n\nIn securities lending arrangements entered into in exchange for the receipt of other securities as collateral, neither the securities received nor the obligation to return them are recognized on UBS's balance sheet, as the risks and rewards of ownership are not  transferred  to  UBS.  In  cases  where  such  financial  assets received  are  subsequently  sold  or  repledged  in  another transaction, this is not considered to be a transfer of financial assets.\n\nOther  financial  asset  transfers  primarily  include  securities transferred to collateralize derivative transactions, for which the carrying amount of associated liabilities is not provided in the table above, because those replacement values are managed on a portfolio basis across counterparties and product types, and therefore there is no direct relationship between the specific collateral pledged and the associated liability.\n\nTransferred financial assets that are not subject to derecognition in full but remain on the balance sheet to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement were not material as of 31 December 2021 and as of 31 December 2020.",

The total amounts that contractually mature in each time band are also shown for 31 December 2020. Derivative positions\n\nand  trading  liabilities,  predominantly  made  up  of  short  sale transactions, are assigned to the Due within 1 month column , as this provides a conservative reflection of the nature of these trading activities. The residual contractual maturities may extend over significantly longer periods.\n\n## Maturity analysis of financial liabilities\n\n|

for financial liabilities at fair value held for trading and derivative financial instruments (see footnote 3), the amounts presented generally represent undiscounted cash flows of future interest and principal payments. 2 2 The time-bucket Due after 5 years includes perpetual loss-absorbing additional tier 1 capital instruments. 3 3 Carrying amount is fair value. Management believes that this best represents the cash flows that would have to be paid if these positions had to be settled or closed out. 4 4 Contractual maturities of financial liabilities at fair value held for trading are: USD 30.8 billion due within 1 month (31 December 2020: USD 32.6 billion), USD 0.9 billion due between 1 month and 1 year (31 December 2020: USD 1.0 billion) and USD 0 billion due between 1 and 5 years (31 December 2020: USD 0 billion). 5 5 Includes USD 34 million (31 December 2020: USD 32 million) related to fair values of derivative loan commitments and forward starting reverse repurchase agreements classified as derivatives, presented within 'Due within 1 month.\" The full contractual committed amount of USD 36.0 billion (31 December 2020: USD 31.3 billion) is presented in Note 10 under notional amounts. 6 6 Future interest payments on variable-rate liabilities are determined by reference to the applicable interest rate prevailing as of the reporting date. Future principal payments that are variable are determined by reference to the conditions existing at the relevant reporting date. 7 7 Excludes derivative loan commitments and forward starting reverse repurchase agreements measured at fair value (see footnote 5).",

        "page_content": "## Note 25  Interest rate benchmark reform\n\n## Background\n\nA market-wide reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, with the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) announcing in March 2021 that the publication of London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBORs) would cease after 31 December 2021 for all non-US dollar LIBORs, as well as for one-week and two-month USD LIBOR. Publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will cease immediately after 30 June 2023.\n\nThe majority of UBS's IBOR exposure was linked to CHF LIBOR and USD LIBOR. The alternative reference rate (the ARR) for CHF LIBOR is the Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON). The ARR for USD LIBOR is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR); in addition, there are recommended ARRs for GBP LIBOR, JPY LIBOR and EUR LIBOR.\n\nThe Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) was reformed in 2019, with the reform consisting of a change in the underlying calculation method. Consequently, contracts linked to EURIBOR are not considered throughout the rest of this Note.\n\nOn 25 January 2021, the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which amend the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain IBORs, came into effect. From that date, all newly cleared and non-cleared derivatives between adhering parties that reference ISDA  standard  definitions  now  include  these  fallbacks.  UBS adhered to the protocol in November 2020.\n\nUBS's focus throughout 2021 was on transitioning existing contracts via bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements, by leveraging industry  solutions  (e.g.,  the  use  of  fallback  provisions)  and through third-party actions (those by clearing houses, agents, etc.). UBS has established a framework to address the transition of contracts that do not contain adequate fallback provisions. Furthermore,  in  line  with  regulatory  guidance,  UBS  has implemented a framework to limit new contracts referencing IBORs.\n\n## Governance over the transition to alternative benchmark rates\n\nUBS  established a global cross-divisional, cross-functional governance structure and change program to address the scale and complexity of the transition. This global program is sponsored by the Group CFO and led by senior representatives from the business divisions and UBS's control and support functions. The program includes governance and execution structures within\n\neach business division, together with cross-divisional teams from each control and support function. During 2021, progress was overseen centrally via a monthly operating committee and a monthly steering committee, as well as quarterly updates to the joint Audit and Risk Committees. A dedicated Group-wide forum, with an increased US regional focus, will oversee progress of the remaining USD LIBOR transition.\n\n## Risks\n\nA  core  part  of  UBS's  change  program  is  the  identification, management and monitoring of the risks associated with IBOR reform and transition. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- -economic risks to UBS and its clients, through the repricing of existing contracts, reduced transparency and / or liquidity of pricing information, market uncertainty or disruption;\n- -accounting risks, where the transition affects the accounting treatment,  including  hedge  accounting  and  consequential income statement volatility;\n- -valuation risks arising from the variation between benchmarks that will cease and ARRs, affecting the risk profile of financial instruments;\n- -operational risks arising from changes to UBS's front-to-back processes and systems to accommodate the transition, e.g., data sourcing and processing and bulk migration of contracts; and\n- -legal and conduct risks relating to UBS's engagement with clients  and  market  counterparties  around  new  benchmark products  and  amendments  required  for  existing  contracts referencing benchmarks that will cease.\n\nOverall, the effort required to transition is affected by multiple factors, including whether negotiations need to take place with multiple stakeholders (as is the case for syndicated loans or certain listed  securities),  market  readiness  -  such  as  liquidity  in  ARRequivalent products - and a client's technical readiness to handle ARR market conventions. UBS remains confident that it has the transparency, oversight and operational preparedness to progress with the IBOR transition consistent with market timelines, given the significant progress made as of 31 December 2021. UBS did not have and does not expect changes to its risk management approach and strategy as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.",

        "page_content": "## Transition progress\n\n## Non-derivative instruments\n\nUBS's significant non-derivative exposures subject to IBOR reform primarily related to brokerage receivable and payable balances, corporate and private loans, and mortgages, linked to CHF and USD LIBORs. During 2020, UBS transitioned most of its CHF LIBOR-linked deposits to SARON. In that same year, UBS launched SARON-based mortgages and corporate loans based on all major ARRs in the Swiss market, as well as SOFR-based mortgages in the US market.\n\nThroughout  2021,  UBS  transitioned  substantially  all  of  its private and corporate loans linked to non-USD IBORs, with the remaining CHF LIBOR-linked contracts planned to transition on their first roll date in 2022.\n\nIn addition, as of 31 December 2021 UBS had completed the transition  of  IBOR-linked  non-derivative  financial  assets  and liabilities  related  to  brokerage  accounts,  except  for  balances originated in the US, which transitioned to SOFR in January 2022.\n\nIn March 2021, following the FCA announcement regarding the cessation timelines for IBORs, UBS initiated a centralized communication initiative for private mortgages linked to CHF LIBOR, with the objective of transitioning these exposures, either through the activation of existing fallbacks or the amendment of contractual terms where such fallbacks do not exist. During 2021, mortgages  that  were  linked  to  CHF  LIBOR  were  reduced  to USD  21 billion as of 31 December 2021, with these remaining mortgages automatically transitioning to SARON from their next coupon roll date.\n\nThe  transition  of  US  securities-based  lending  to  SOFR, amounting to USD 37 billion as of 31 December 2021, was for the most part completed in January 2022, with US mortgages linked to USD LIBOR planned to transition to SOFR in 2022-2023.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, UBS had approximately USD 3 billion equivalent of Japanese yen- and US dollar-denominated publicly issued benchmark bonds that, per current contractual terms, if not called on their respective call dates, would reset based directly on JPY LIBOR and USD LIBOR. These bonds have robust IBOR fallback language and the confirmation of interest rate calculation mechanics will be communicated as market standards formalize and in advance of any rate resets. In addition, several US dollar-\n\nand Swiss franc-denominated benchmark bonds publicly issued by UBS reference rates indirectly derived from IBORs, if they are not called on their respective call dates. UBS aims to transition those bonds in advance of their reset dates, with the transition of Swiss franc-denominated benchmark bonds completed in January 2022. These debt instruments have not been included in the table on the following page, given their current fixed-rate coupon.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, UBS had approximately USD 5 billion of irrevocable commitments that may be drawn down in different currencies with IBOR-linked interest rates and that expire after the relevant benchmark cessation dates; approximately USD 3 billion of these contracts had transitioned for all IBORs, except USD LIBOR,  and  USD 2  billion  of  these  commitments  retained  a non-USD  IBOR  interest  rate  as  of  31 December  2021  with transition dependent upon the actions of other parties. To the extent non-USD IBOR-linked amounts are requested under these contracts, UBS will seek to renegotiate current terms or rely on legislative solutions.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nUBS holds derivatives for trading and hedging purposes, including those designated in hedge accounting relationships. A significant number of interest rate and cross-currency swaps have floating legs that reference various benchmarks that are subject to IBOR reform.\n\nThe majority of derivatives are transacted with clearing houses, in particular LCH, with the transition of these non-USD IBORlinked derivatives substantially completed in December 2021. UBS had also completed the transition of all non-USD IBOR-linked exchange-traded  derivatives  (ETDs)  through  participation  in activities  organized  by  respective  exchanges  by  31 December 2021.\n\nFor  derivatives  not  transacted  with  clearing  houses  or exchanges, UBS  and  a  significant proportion of UBS's counterparties have adhered to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, which builds in agreed fallbacks. The majority of these contracts had transitioned as of 31 December 2021, with a small number of contracts transitioned in January 2022, to ensure an orderly transition when converting high volumes of transactions at the time of cessation.",

Fair value changes arising from such risk are usually the largest component of the overall change in the fair value of the hedged position in transaction currency.\n\nCross-currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps are mainly designated as hedges of structural foreign  exchange  risk  related  to  net  investments  in  foreign operations.  In  both  cases  the  hedged  risk  arises  solely  from changes in spot foreign exchange rate.\n\nThe notional of the designated hedging instruments matches the notional of the hedged items, except when the interest rate swaps are re-designated in cash flow hedges, in which case the hedge  ratio  designated  is  determined  based  on  the  swap sensitivity.\n\n## Hedged items and hedge designation\n\n## Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets\n\nFair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets involve swapping fixed cash flows associated with the debt issued, debt securities held and, from 2021 onward, loan assets (principally long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans in Swiss francs formerly designated within 'Fair value hedges of portfolio interest rate risk related to loans designated under IAS 39') to floating cash flows by entering into interest rate swaps that either receive fixed and pay floating cash flows or that pay fixed and receive floating cash flows.\n\nDesignations  have  been  made  in  US  dollars,  euros,  Swiss francs, Australian dollars, Japanese yen and Singapore dollars. For new hedging instruments and hedged risk designations entered into in 2021 in these currencies (with the exception of euro), the benchmark rate was the relevant alternative reference rate (ARR). Following the interbank offered rate (IBOR) transition for swaps with LCH (formerly the London Clearing House) in December 2021, the benchmark hedge rate for Swiss franc and Japanese yen designations was changed from an IBOR rate to the relevant ARR with the hedge relationship continuing in accordance with Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) .\n\n## Fair value hedges of portfolio interest rate risk related to loans designated under IAS 39\n\nPrior to December 2021, the Group hedged an open portfolio of long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans in Swiss francs using interest rate swaps that paid a fixed rate of interest and received a floating rate of interest. Both the hedged portfolio and the hedging instruments were adjusted on a monthly basis to reflect changes in size and the maturity profile of the hedged portfolio. Each month the hedge relationship was discontinued and a new one designated. Changes in the portfolio were driven by new loans being originated or loans being repaid.\n\n## Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions\n\nThe Group hedges forecast cash flows on non-trading financial assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates or are expected to be refinanced or reinvested in the future, due to movements in future market rates. The amounts and timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for identifying the non-trading interest rate risk of the Group, which is hedged with interest rate swaps, the maximum maturity of which is 10 years. Cash flow forecasts and risk exposures are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis, and consequently additional hedging instruments are traded and designated, or are terminated resulting in a hedge discontinuance.  Hedge  designations  have  been  made  in  the following  currencies:  US  dollars,  euros,  Swiss  francs,  pounds sterling and Hong Kong dollars. The cash flow hedges in US dollars, Swiss francs and pounds sterling were discontinued and replaced with new ARR designations in December 2021.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1b for more information\n\n## Fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk related to issued debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments denominated in currencies other than the US dollar  are  designated  in  fair  value  hedges  of  spot  foreign exchange risk, in addition to and separate from the fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Cross-currency swaps economically convert debt denominated in currencies other than the US dollar to  US  dollars.  This  hedge  accounting  program  started  on 1 January 2020, with the adoption of the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, by UBS.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1b for more information\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting for certain net investments in foreign operations, which include subsidiaries, branches and associates. Upon maturity of hedging instruments, typically two months,  the  hedge  relationship  is  terminated  and  new designations  are  made  to  reflect  any  changes  in  the  net investments in foreign operations.",

        "page_content": "## Note 26  Hedge accounting (continued)\n\n## Economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument\n\nFor hedges designated under IFRS 9, the economic relationship between  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument  is determined based on a qualitative analysis of their critical terms. In cases where hedge designation takes place after origination of the hedging instrument, a quantitative analysis of the possible behavior of the hedging derivative and the hedged item during their respective terms is also performed.\n\nPrior to December 2021, for the fair value hedge of portfolio interest rate risk related to loans designated under IAS 39, hedge effectiveness was assessed by comparing changes in the fair value of the hedged portfolio of loans attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate with the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\n\n## Sources of hedge ineffectiveness\n\nIn hedges of interest rate risk, hedge ineffectiveness can arise from mismatches of critical terms and / or the use of different curves to discount the hedged item and instrument, or from entering into a hedge relationship after the trade date of the hedging derivative.\n\nIn hedges of foreign exchange risk related to debt issued, hedge ineffectiveness can arise due to the discounting of the hedging instruments and undesignated risk components and lack of such discounting and risk components in the hedged items.\n\nIn hedges  of  net  investments  in  foreign  operations, ineffectiveness is unlikely unless the hedged net assets fall below the designated hedged amount. The exceptions are hedges where the hedging currency is not the same as the currency of the foreign operation,  where  the  currency  basis  may  cause ineffectiveness.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in Other net income.\n\n## Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships\n\nNon-hedge accounted derivatives are mandatorily held for trading with all fair value movements taken to Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss , even when held as an economic hedge or to facilitate client clearing.

Interest rate swaps designated in hedge relationships referencing GBP, CHF and JPY LIBOR transitioned to ARRs in December 2021 when LCH transitioned its contracts. For other currencies, IBOR quotations remain available, but all new designations will reference ARR. As such,  ARR  designations  in  these  currencies  will  replace  IBOR designations as IBOR contracts mature.\n\nThe Group's hedge relationships are also exposed to the Euro Inter-bank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), which is expected to continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. Thus, the Group  does  not  consider  its  hedges  involving  the  EURIBOR benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nApart from EURIBOR hedges, UBS applied the relief to all its fair value hedges of interest rate risk and to those cash flow hedge relationships  where  the  hedged  risk  is  LIBOR  or  EONIA.  The following table provides details on the notional amount and carrying amount of the hedging instruments in those hedge relationships maturing after 31 December 2021, or 30 June 2023 for USD LIBOR hedges, which are the cessation dates of the applicable interest rate benchmarks.\n\nHedges  of  net  investments  in  foreign  operations  are  not affected by the amendments.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 2j for more information about the relief provided by the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 related to interest rate benchmark reform\n- \u203a Refer to Note 25 Interest rate benchmark reform for more information about the transition progress\n\n## Hedging instruments referencing LIBOR\n\n|                                       | 3311..1122..2211                  | 3311..1122..2211                                            | 3311..1122..2211                                                      | 31.12.20         | 31.12.20                      | 31.12.20                           |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                       |                                   | CCaarrrryyiinngg  aammoouunntt                              | CCaarrrryyiinngg  aammoouunntt                                        |                  | Carrying amount               | Carrying amount                    |\n| USD million                           | N Noottiioonnaall   a ammoouunntt | D Deerriivvaattiivvee   f fiinnaanncciiaall   a asssseettss | D Deerriivvaattiivvee   f fiinnaanncciiaall   l liiaabbiilliittiieess | Notional  amount | Derivative  financial  assets | Derivative  financial  liabilities |\n| I Inntteerreesstt  rraattee  rriisskk |                                   |                                                             |                                                                       |                  |                               |                                    |\n| Fair value hedges                     | 2233,,336677                      | 00                                                          | 00                                                                    | 37,146           | 1                             | (12)                               |\n| Cash flow hedges                      | 1100,,880033                      | 00                                                          | 00                                                                    | 11,179           | 0                             | 0                                  |",

        "page_content": "## a) Defined benefit plans\n\nUBS has established defined benefit plans for its employees in various  jurisdictions  in  accordance  with  local  regulations  and practices. The major plans are located in Switzerland, the UK, the US and Germany. The level of benefits depends on the specific plan rules.\n\n## Swiss pension plan\n\nThe  Swiss  pension  plan  covers  employees  of  UBS  AG  in Switzerland and employees of companies in Switzerland having close economic or financial ties with UBS AG, and exceeds the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law. The Swiss plan offers retirement, disability and survivor benefits and is governed by a Pension Foundation Board. The responsibilities of this board are defined by Swiss pension law and the plan rules.\n\nSavings  contributions  to  the  Swiss  plan  are  paid  by  both employer and employee. Depending on the age of the employee, UBS pays a savings contribution that ranges between 6.5% and 27.5% of contributory base salary and between 2.8% and 9% of contributory variable compensation. UBS also pays risk contributions that are used to fund disability and survivor benefits. Employees can choose the level of savings contributions paid by them, which vary between 2.5% and 13.5% of contributory base salary  and  between  0%  and  9%  of  contributory  variable compensation,  depending  on  age  and  choice  of  savings contribution category.\n\nThe plan offers to members at the normal retirement age of 65 a choice between a lifetime pension and a partial or full lump sum payment. Participants can choose to draw early retirement benefits starting from the age of 58, but can also continue employment and remain active members of the plan until the age of  70.  Employees  have  the  opportunity  to  make  additional purchases of benefits to fund early retirement benefits.\n\nThe pension amount payable to a participant is calculated by applying a conversion rate to the accumulated balance of the participant's retirement savings account at the retirement date. The balance is based on credited vested benefits transferred from previous employers, purchases of benefits, and the employee and employer contributions that have been made to the participant's retirement savings account, as well as the interest accrued. The annual interest rate credited to participants is determined by the Pension Foundation Board at the end of each year.\n\nAlthough the Swiss plan is based on a defined contribution promise under Swiss pension law, it is accounted for as a defined benefit plan under IFRS, primarily because of the obligation to accrue interest on the participants' retirement savings accounts and the payment of lifetime pension benefits.\n\nAn actuarial valuation in accordance with Swiss pension law is performed regularly. Should an underfunded situation on this\n\nbasis occur, the Pension Foundation Board is required to take the necessary measures to ensure that full funding can be expected to be restored within a maximum period of 10 years. If a Swiss plan  were  to  become  significantly  underfunded  on  a  Swiss pension law basis, additional employer and employee contributions could be required. In this situation, the risk is shared between employer and employees, and the employer is not legally obliged to cover more than 50% of the additional contributions required. As of 31 December 2021, the Swiss plan had a technical funding ratio in accordance with Swiss pension law of 134.8% (31 December 2020: 132.6%).\n\nThe investment strategy of the Swiss plan complies with Swiss pension  law,  including  the  rules  and  regulations  relating  to diversification of plan assets, and is derived from the risk budget defined by the Pension Foundation Board on the basis of regularly performed asset and liability management analyses. The Pension Foundation Board strives for a medium- and long-term balance between assets and liabilities.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Swiss plan was in a surplus situation on an IFRS measurement basis, as the fair value of the plan's assets exceeded the defined benefit obligation (DBO) by USD 6,577 million (31 December 2020: a surplus of USD 4,862 million). However, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does not exceed the estimated future economic  benefit,  which  equals  the  difference  between  the present value of the estimated future net service cost and the present value of the estimated future employer contributions. As of  both  31 December  2021  and  31 December  2020,  the estimated future economic benefit was zero and hence no net defined benefit asset was recognized on the balance sheet.\n\n## Changes to the Swiss pension plan in 2019\n\nThe Pension Foundation Board and UBS agreed to implement measures that took effect from the start of 2019 to support the long-term  financial  stability  of  the  Swiss  pension  fund.  The measures, among other things, lowered the conversion rate and increased the normal retirement age from 64 to 65. Pensions already in payment on 1 January 2019 were not affected.\n\nTo mitigate the effects for active participants, UBS committed to pay an extraordinary contribution of up to CHF 720 million (USD 790 million at the closing exchange rate on 31 December 2021)  in  three  installments  in  2020,  2021  and  2022.  Two installments of USD 235 million and USD 254 million paid in 2020 and 2021 reduced OCI with no effect on the income statement.\n\nThe third installment, CHF 193 million (USD 212 million at the closing exchange rate on 31 December 2021), will be paid in the first quarter of 2022. The regular employer contributions to be made to the Swiss plan in 2022 are estimated at USD 491 million.",

        "page_content": "## Note 27  Post-employment benefit plans (continued)\n\n## UK pension plan\n\nThe UK plan is a career-average revalued earnings scheme, and benefits increase automatically based on UK price inflation. The normal retirement age for participants in the UK plan is 60. The plan provides guaranteed lifetime pension benefits to participants upon retirement. The UK plan has been closed to new entrants for more than 20 years and, since 2013, participants are no longer accruing benefits for current or future service. Instead, employees participate in the UK defined contribution plan.\n\nThe governance responsibility for the UK plan lies jointly with the Pension Trustee Board and UBS. The employer contributions to  the  pension  fund  reflect  agreed-upon  deficit  funding contributions, which are determined on the basis of the most recent  actuarial  valuation  using  assumptions  agreed  by  the Pension Trustee Board and UBS. In the event of underfunding, UBS and the Pension Trustee Board must agree on a deficit recovery plan within statutory deadlines. In 2021, UBS made no deficit funding contributions to the UK plan. In 2020, UBS made deficit funding contributions of USD 46 million.\n\nThe  plan  assets  are  invested  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of financial assets, which include a longevity swap with an external insurance company. This swap enables the UK pension plan to hedge the risk between expected and actual longevity, which should mitigate volatility in the net defined benefit asset / liability. As of 31 December 2021, the longevity swap had a negative value of USD 3 million (31 December 2020: zero).\n\nIn 2019, UBS and the Pension Trustee Board entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool was established to provide security for the pension fund. The value of the collateral pool as of 31 December 2021 was USD 337 million (31 December 2020: USD 347 million) and includes corporate bonds, governmentrelated  debt  instruments  and  other  financial  assets.  The arrangement provides the Pension Trustee Board dedicated access to a pool of assets in the event of UBS's insolvency or not paying a required deficit funding contribution.\n\nThe employer contributions to be made to the UK defined benefit plan in 2022 are estimated at USD 5 million, subject to regular funding reviews during the year.\n\n## US pension plans\n\nThere are two distinct major defined benefit plans in the US, with a normal retirement age of 65. Both plans were closed to new entrants  more  than  20  years  ago.  Since  they  closed,  new employees have participated in a defined contribution plan.\n\nOne of the defined benefit plans is a contribution-based plan in which each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account. The retirement savings account is credited annually with interest based on a rate that is linked to\n\nthe average yield on one-year US government bonds. For the other defined benefit plan, retirement benefits accrue based on the career-average earnings of each individual plan participant. Former employees with vested benefits have the option to take a lump sum payment or a lifetime annuity.\n\nAs required under applicable pension laws, both plans have fiduciaries  who,  together  with  UBS,  are  responsible  for  the governance of the plans.\n\nThe  plan  assets  of  both  plans  are  invested  in  diversified portfolios of financial assets. Each  plan's  fiduciaries  are responsible for the investment decisions with respect to the plan assets.\n\nThe employer contributions to be made to the US defined benefit plans in 2022 are estimated at USD 10 million.\n\n## German pension plans\n\nThere are two defined benefit plans in Germany, which are both unfunded. The normal retirement age is 65 and benefits are paid directly by UBS. In the larger of the two plans each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account. The accumulated account balance of the participant is credited on an annual basis with guaranteed interest at a rate of 5%. The plan has been closed to new entrants and all participants younger than the age of 55 no longer accrue benefits. In the other plan, amounts  are  accrued  annually  based  on  employee  elections related to variable compensation. For this plan, the accumulated account balance is credited on an annual basis with a guaranteed interest rate of 6% for amounts accrued before 2010, of 4% for amounts accrued from 2010 to 2017 and of 0.9% for amounts accrued after 2017. Both plans are subject to German pension law, whereby the responsibility to pay pension benefits when they are due resides entirely with UBS. A portion of the pension payments is directly increased in line with price inflation.\n\nIn June 2021, UBS implemented a new funded pension plan with interest credited to participants equal to actual investment returns  with  a  guaranteed  minimum  of  0%.  The  plan  was implemented retrospectively for new hires since June 2018 and for all eligible active participants younger than 55 from July 2021. Each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings account.\n\nThe employer contributions to be made to the German defined benefit plans in 2022 are estimated at USD 12 million.\n\n## Financial information by plan\n\nThe tables on the following pages provide an analysis of the movement in the net asset / liability recognized on the balance sheet for defined benefit plans, as well as an analysis of amounts recognized in net profit and in Other comprehensive incom e.",

Changes in the defined benefit obligation are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds quoted\n\nin an active market in the currency of the respective plan. A decrease in the discount curve increases the DBO. UBS regularly reviews the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the DBO to determine their continuing relevance.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 5 for a description of the accounting policy for defined benefit plans\n\nThe tables below show the significant actuarial assumptions used in calculating the DBO at the end of the year.\n\n## Significant actuarial assumptions\n\n|                                               | Swiss pension plan   | Swiss pension plan   |                   |          | US and German pension  plans 1   | US and German pension  plans 1   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| In %                                          | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             | 3 311..1122..2211 | 31.12.20 | 3 311..1122..2211                | 31.12.20                         |\n| Discount rate                                 | 00..3344             | 0.10                 | 11..8822          | 1.42     | 22..1100                         | 1.62                             |\n| Rate of salary increase                       | 22..0011             | 2.00                 | 00..0000          | 0.00     | 22..3355                         | 2.25                             |\n| Rate of pension increase                      | 00..0000             | 0.00                 | 33..3322          | 2.89     | 11..8800                         | 1.70                             |\n| Rate of interest credit on retirement savings | 11..0044             | 0.60                 | 00..0000          | 0.00     | 11..1188                         | 1.12                             |\n\n## Mortality tables and life expectancies for major plans\n\n|                 |                                          | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male member currently   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                                          | aged 65                                                 | aged 65                                                 | aged 45                                                 | aged 45                                                 |\n| C Coouunnttrryy | M Moorrttaalliittyy  ttaabbllee          | 3 311..1122..2211                                       | 31.12.20                                                | 3 311..1122..2211                                       | 31.12.20                                                |\n| Switzerland     | BVG 2020 G with CMI 2019 projections     | 2211..77                                                | 21.7                                                    | 2233..33                                                | 23.2                                                    |\n| UK              | S3PA with CMI 2020 projections 1         | 2233..44                                                | 23.4                                                    | 2244..55                                                | 24.6                                                    |\n| USA             | Pri-2012 with MP-2021 projection scale 2 | 2211..99                                                | 21.8                                                    | 2233..33                                                | 23.2                                                    |\n| Germany         | Dr. K.

These activities can include, but are not limited to, trading, securities lending and borrowing and derivative transactions. The non-Swiss UBS pension funds do not have a similar banking relationship with UBS.\n\nAlso, UBS leases certain properties that are owned by the Swiss pension  fund.  As  of  31 December  2021,  the  minimum commitment toward the Swiss pension fund under the related\n\nleases  was  approximately  USD 9  million  (31 December  2020: USD 11 million).\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 'Composition and fair value of plan assets' table in Note 27a for more information about fair value of investments in UBS instruments held by the Swiss pension fund\n\nThe following amounts have been received or paid by UBS from  and  to  the  post-employment  benefit  plans  located  in Switzerland, the UK, the US and Germany in respect of these banking activities and arrangements.\n\n## Related-party disclosure\n\n|                                            | For the year ended   | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| USD million                                | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             | 31.12.19             |\n| R Reecceeiivveedd  bbyy  UUBBSS            |                      |                      |                      |\n| Fees                                       | 3399                 | 34                   | 34                   |\n| P Paaiidd  bbyy  UUBBSS                    |                      |                      |                      |\n| Rent                                       | 44                   | 5                    | 4                    |\n| Dividends, capital repayments and interest | 55                   | 10                   | 11                   |\n\nThe transaction volumes in UBS shares and UBS debt instruments and the balances of UBS shares held were:\n\n## Transaction volumes - UBS shares and UBS debt instruments\n\n|                                                                                                               | For the year ended   | For the year ended   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                               | 3311..1122..2211     | 31.12.20             |\n| F Fiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss  bboouugghhtt  bbyy  ppeennssiioonn  ffuunnddss                   |                      |                      |\n| UBS shares (in thousands of shares)                                                                           | 990077               | 1,758                |\n| UBS debt instruments (par values, USD million)                                                                | 3377                 | 28                   |\n| F Fiinnaanncciiaall  iinnssttrruummeennttss  ssoolldd  bbyy  ppeennssiioonn  ffuunnddss  oorr  mmaattuurreedd |                      |                      |\n| UBS shares (in thousands of shares)                                                                           | 11,,668888           | 2,605                |\n| UBS debt instruments (par values, USD million)                                                                | 4400                 | 6                    |\n| UBS shares held by post-employment benefit plans                                                              |                      |                      |\n|                                                                                                               | 3 311..1122..2211    | 31.12.20             |\n| Number of shares (in thousands of shares)                                                                     | 1144,,007733         | 14,854               |\n| Fair value (USD million)                                                                                      | 225522               | 210                  |",

        "page_content": "## a) Plans offered\n\nThe  Group  has  several  share-based  and  other  deferred compensation plans that align the interests of Group Executive Board (GEB) members and other employees with the interests of investors.\n\nShare-based awards are granted in the form of notional shares and, where permitted, carry a dividend equivalent that may be paid in notional shares or cash. Awards are settled by delivering UBS shares at vesting, except in jurisdictions where this is not permitted for legal or tax reasons.\n\nDeferred compensation awards are generally forfeitable upon, among other circumstances, voluntary termination of employment with UBS. These compensation plans are also designed to meet regulatory  requirements  and  include  special  provisions  for regulated employees.\n\nThe most significant deferred compensation plans are described below.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 1a item 5 for a description of the accounting policy related to share-based and other deferred compensation plans\n\n## Mandatory deferred compensation plans\n\n## The Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a mandatory deferred share-based compensation plan for senior leaders of the Group (i.e., GEB members and selected senior management).\n\nThe number of notional shares delivered at vesting depends on two equally weighted performance metrics over a three-year performance period: reported return on common equity tier 1 capital and relative total shareholder return, which measures the performance  of  UBS  against  an  index  of  Global  Systemically Important Banks as determined by the Financial Stability Board.\n\nThe final number of shares will vest in three equal installments in each of the three years following the performance period for GEB  members,  and  cliff  vest  in  the  first  year  following  the performance period for selected senior management.\n\n## The Equity Ownership Plan\n\nThe  Equity  Ownership  Plan  (EOP)  is  a  deferred  share-based compensation plan for employees who are subject to deferral requirements but do not receive LTIP awards. Vesting under the EOP generally occurs in equal installments two and three years after grant, subject to continued employment and, in certain cases, achievement of defined performance conditions.\n\nAsset Management employees receive some or all of their EOP in  the  form  of  cash-settled  notional  investment  funds.  The amount  delivered  depends  on  the  value  of  the  underlying investment funds at the time of vesting.\n\n## The Deferred Contingent Capital Plan\n\nThe  Deferred  Contingent  Capital  Plan  (DCCP)  is  a  deferred compensation plan for all employees who are subject to deferral requirements. Such employees are awarded notional additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments, which, at the discretion of UBS, can be settled as a cash payment or a perpetual, marketable AT1 capital instrument. DCCP awards generally vest in full after five years, unless the award is written down following the occurrence of a viability event (as defined under the terms of an AT1 instrument) or if the Group's CET1 capital ratio falls below a defined threshold. Additional performance conditions apply to GEB members.\n\nInterest payments on DCCP awards are paid at the discretion of UBS. Where interest payments are not permitted, such as for certain regulated employees, the DCCP award reflects the fair value of the granted non-interest-bearing award.\n\n## Financial advisor variable compensation\n\nIn  line  with  market  practice  for  US  wealth  management businesses, the compensation for US financial advisors in Global Wealth Management predominantly includes production payout and  deferred  compensation  awards.  Production  payout  is primarily based on compensable revenue. Financial advisors may also qualify for deferred compensation awards, which generally vest over a six-year period. These awards are based on strategic performance  measures,  including  production  and  length  of service with  UBS.  Production  payout  rates  and  deferred compensation awards may be reduced for, among other things, errors, negligence or carelessness, or failure to comply with the firm's  rules,  standards,  practices  and  /  or  policies,  and  /  or applicable laws and regulations.\n\nFinancial advisor compensation also includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial  advisors entered into  at the time of recruitment that are subject  to vesting requirements.\n\n## Share delivery obligations\n\nShare  delivery  obligations  related  to  employee  share-based compensation awards were 175 million shares as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 172 million shares). Share delivery obligations are calculated on the basis of undistributed notional share  awards,  taking  applicable  performance  conditions  into account.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, UBS held 149 million treasury shares (31 December 2020: 157 million) that were available to satisfy share delivery obligations.",

During 2021, the Group sponsored the creation of various SEs and interacted  with  a  number  of  non-sponsored  SEs,  including securitization  vehicles,  client  vehicles  and  certain  investment funds, that UBS did not consolidate as of 31 December 2021 because it did not control them.\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe table below presents the Group's interests in and maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated SEs, as well as the total assets held by the SEs in which UBS had an interest as of yearend, except for investment funds sponsored by third parties, for which the carrying amount of UBS's interest as of year-end has been disclosed.\n\n## Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in which UBS did not have an interest at year-end\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Group did not earn material income from sponsored unconsolidated SEs in which UBS did not have an interest at year-end.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, UBS and third parties did not transfer any assets into sponsored securitization vehicles created in the year. UBS and third parties transferred assets, alongside deposits and debt issuances (which are assets from the perspective of the vehicle), of USD 1 billion and USD 2 billion, respectively, into sponsored client vehicles created in 2021 (2020: USD 0 billion and USD 9  billion,  respectively).  For  sponsored  investment  funds, transfers  arose  during  the  period  as  investors  invested  and redeemed positions, thereby changing the overall size of the funds, which, when combined with market movements, resulted in a total closing net asset value of USD 46 billion (31 December 2020: USD 37 billion).\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\n|

        "page_content": "The Group retains or purchases interests in unconsolidated SEs in the form of direct investments, financing, guarantees, letters of credit, derivatives, as well as through management contracts. The Group's maximum exposure to loss is generally equal to the carrying amount of the Group's interest in the SE, with this subject to change over time with market movements. Guarantees, letters of  credit  and  credit  derivatives  are  an  exception,  with  the contract's notional amount, adjusted for losses already incurred, representing the maximum loss that the Group is exposed to.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss disclosed in the table on the previous page does not reflect the Group's risk management activities, including effects from financial instruments that may be used to economically hedge risks inherent in the unconsolidated SE  or  risk-reducing  effects  of  collateral  or  other  credit enhancements.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, the Group did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to an unconsolidated SE when not contractually obligated to do so, nor does the Group have any intention to do so in the future.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, income and expenses from interests in unconsolidated  SEs  primarily  resulted  from  mark-to-market movements  recognized  in Other  net  income  from  financial instruments measured at fair value through profit of loss , which have generally been hedged with other financial instruments, as well  as  fee  and  commission  income  received  from  UBSsponsored funds.\n\n## Interests in securitization vehicles\n\nAs of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group held interests, both retained and acquired, in various securitization vehicles that relate to financing, underwriting, secondary market and derivative trading activities.\n\nThe numbers outlined in the table on the previous page may differ  from  the  securitization  positions  presented  in  the 31 December  2021  Pillar 3  Report,  available  under  'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for the following reasons: (i) exclusion of synthetic securitizations transacted with entities that are not SEs and transactions in which the Group did not have an interest because it did not absorb any risk; (ii) a different measurement basis in certain cases (e.g., IFRS carrying amount within the previous table compared with net exposure amount at default for Pillar 3 disclosures); and (iii) different classification of vehicles viewed as sponsored by the Group versus sponsored by third parties.\n\n- \u203a Refer to the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors , for more information\n\n## Interests in client vehicles\n\nClient vehicles are established predominantly for clients to gain exposure to specific assets or risk exposures. Such vehicles may enter into derivative agreements, with UBS or a third party, to align the cash flows of the entity with the investor's intended investment objective, or to introduce other desired risk exposures.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020, the Group retained interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS and third parties that relate to financing, secondary market and derivative trading activities, and to hedge structured product offerings.\n\n## Interests in investment funds\n\nInvestment funds have a collective investment objective, and are either passively managed, so that any decision making does not have a substantive effect on variability, or are actively managed and investors or their governing bodies do not have substantive voting or similar rights.\n\nThe Group holds interests in a number of investment funds, primarily resulting from seed investments or in order to hedge structured product offerings. In addition to the interests disclosed in the table on the previous page, the Group manages the assets of various pooled investment funds and receives fees based, in whole or part, on the net asset value of the fund and / or the performance of the fund. The specific fee structure is determined based on various market factors and considers the fund's nature and the jurisdiction of incorporation, as well as fee schedules negotiated with clients. These fee contracts represent an interest in the fund, as they align the Group's exposure with investors, providing a variable return based on the performance of the entity. Depending on the structure of the fund, these fees may be collected  directly  from  the  fund's  assets  and  /  or  from  the investors. Any amounts due are collected on a regular basis and are generally backed by the fund's assets. Therefore interest in such  funds  is  not  represented  by  the  on-balance  sheet  fee receivable but rather by the future exposure to variable fees. The total assets of such funds were USD 370 billion and USD 359 billion  as  of  31 December  2021  and  31 December  2020, respectively, and have been excluded from the table on the previous page. The Group did not have any material exposure to loss  from  these  interests  as  of  31 December  2021  or  as  of 31 December 2020.",

(SuMi  Trust  Holdings).  In  January  2020,  the  first  phase  was launched, with operations commencing in the joint venture that was established to promote the respective services. At the time, UBS and SuMi Trust Holdings also started offering each other's products and services to their respective clients.\n\nIn  the  third  quarter  of  2021,  the  second  phase  of  the partnership was completed, with the launch of a new operational partnership entity, UBS SuMi TRUST Wealth Management Co., Ltd., which is 51%-owned and controlled by UBS, requiring UBS to consolidate this entity. The new entity offers global securities and wealth management capabilities, together with the custody, real  estate,  inheritance  and  wealth  transfer  expertise  of  a Japanese  trust  banking  group.  Upon  completion  of  this transaction in the third quarter of 2021, shareholders' equity of the Group increased by USD 155 million, with no effect on profit or loss.\n\n## Disposals of subsidiaries and businesses\n\n## Sale of remaining investment in Clearstream Fund Centre AG\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, UBS sold its remaining minority investment in Clearstream Fund Centre AG to Deutsche B\u00f6rse AG for  CHF 390  million.  The  transaction  followed  the  sale  of  a majority  investment  and  successful  transfer  of  control  of Fondcenter  AG  to  Deutsche  B\u00f6rse  AG  in  2020,  when  UBS recognized a post-tax gain on sale of USD 631 million in Other income .

        "page_content": "## Note 32  Invested assets and net new money\n\nThe following disclosures provide a breakdown of UBS's invested assets and a presentation of their development, including net new money, as required by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.\n\n## Invested assets\n\nInvested assets consist of all client assets managed by or deposited with  UBS  for  investment  purposes.  Invested  assets  include managed fund assets, managed institutional assets, discretionary and advisory wealth management portfolios, fiduciary deposits, time  deposits,  savings  accounts,  and  wealth  management securities  or  brokerage  accounts.  All  assets  held  for  purely transactional purposes  and  custody-only  assets,  including corporate client assets held for cash management  and transactional purposes, are excluded from invested assets, as the Group only administers the assets and does not offer advice on how they should be invested. Also excluded are non-bankable assets (e.g., art collections) and deposits from third-party banks for funding or trading purposes.\n\nDiscretionary  assets  are  defined  as  client  assets  that  UBS decides how to invest. Other invested assets are those where the client ultimately decides how the assets are invested. When a single product is created in one business division and sold in another, it is counted in both the business division managing the investment and the one distributing it. This results in double counting  within  UBS  total  invested  assets,  as  both  business divisions are independently providing a service to their respective clients, and both add value and generate revenue.\n\n## Net new money\n\nNet new money in a reporting period is the amount of invested assets entrusted to UBS by new and existing clients, less those withdrawn  by  existing  clients  and  clients  who  terminated relationships with UBS.\n\nNet new money is calculated using the direct method, under which  inflows  and  outflows  to  /  from  invested  assets  are determined at the client level, based on transactions. Interest and dividend income from invested assets are not counted as net new money inflows. Market and currency movements, as well as fees, commissions and interest on loans charged, are excluded from net new  money,  as  are  effects  resulting  from  any  acquisition  or divestment  of  a  UBS  subsidiary  or  business.  Reclassifications between invested assets and custody-only assets as a result of a change in service level delivered are generally treated as net new money flows. However, where the change in service level directly results from an externally imposed regulation or a strategic decision by UBS to exit a market or specific service offering, the one-time net effect is reported as Other effects .\n\nThe Investment Bank does not track invested assets and net new money. However, when a client is transferred from the Investment Bank to another business division, this may produce net new money even though the client assets were already with UBS.\n\n## Invested assets and net new money\n\n|                                                | As of or for the year ended   | As of or for the year ended   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| USD billion                                    | 3 311..1122..2211             | 31.12.20                      |\n| Fund assets managed by UBS                     | 441199                        | 397                           |\n| Discretionary assets                           | 11,,770055                    | 1,459                         |\n| Other invested assets                          | 22,,447722                    | 2,331                         |\n| TToottaall  iinnvveesstteedd  aasssseettss 1 1 | 44,,559966                    | 4,187                         |\n| of which: double counts                        | 335566                        | 311                           |\n| N Neett  nneeww  mmoonneeyy 1 1                | 115599                        | 127                           |\n\n1\n\n1\n\nIncludes double counts.\n\n## Development of invested assets\n\n| USD billion                                                                                   | 2 2002211   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Total invested assets at the beginning of the year 1                                          | 44,,118877  | 3,607  |\n| Net new money                                                                                 | 115599      | 127    |\n| Market movements 2                                                                            | 333399      | 359    |\n| Foreign currency translation                                                                  | ((6655))    | 96     |\n| Other effects                                                                                 | ((2244))    | (1)    |\n| of which: acquisitions / (divestments)                                                        | ((55))      | 0      |\n| T Toottaall  iinnvveesstteedd  aasssseettss  aatt  tthhee  eenndd  ooff  tthhee  yyeeaarr 1 1 | 44,,559966  | 4,187  |\n\n- 1 1 Includes double counts. 2 2 Includes interest and dividend income.",

These events, together with potential countersanctions and other measures taken by Russia, impact UBS's businesses.\n\nUBS's  country  risk  exposure  to  Russia  was  approximately USD 0.6 billion across its business divisions as of 31 December 2021. This exposure has been reduced since year-end 2021. In addition, UBS is currently monitoring settlement risk on certain open transactions with Russian bank- or non-bank counterparties or Russian underlyings, as market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures. UBS's balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 also included net assets of USD 51 million held in UBS's Russian subsidiary, OOO UBS Bank. As of 3 March 2022, UBS also had approximately USD 0.2 billion\n\nof exposure arising from reliance on Russian assets as collateral on Lombard lending and other secured financing in Global Wealth Management.\n\nAs of 3 March 2022, UBS identified a small number of Global Wealth Management clients subject to the recently introduced sanctions with total loans outstanding of under USD 10 million.\n\nUBS continues to closely monitor related effects on its financial statements, including estimated direct and indirect impacts on expected credit loss calculations and on fair value measurement of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures. The situation continues  to  evolve  and  broader  implications  for  other counterparties of UBS, including financial institutions, are not possible to assess at this time; however, there were no material adverse effects on UBS's financial statements as of 4 March 2022.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Top and emerging risks' and 'Country risk' in the 'Risk management and control' section and to 'Performance in the financial services industry is affected by market conditions and the macroeconomic climate' in the 'Risk factors' section of this report for more information",

        "page_content": "The  consolidated  financial  statements  of  UBS  Group  AG  are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) requires financial groups presenting financial statements under  IFRS  to  provide  a  narrative  explanation  of  the  main differences between  IFRS and Swiss generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (the FINMA Accounting Ordinance, FINMA Circular 2020/1 'Accounting - banks' and the Banking Ordinance (the BO)). Included in this Note are the significant differences in the recognition and measurement between IFRS and  the  provisions  of  the  BO  and  the  guidelines  of  FINMA governing  true  and  fair  view  financial  statement  reporting pursuant to Art. 25 to Art. 42 of the BO.\n\n## 1. Consolidation\n\nUnder IFRS, all entities that are controlled by the holding entity are consolidated. Under Swiss GAAP, controlled entities deemed immaterial to the Group or held only temporarily are exempt from consolidation, but  instead  are  recorded  as  participations accounted for under the equity method of accounting or as financial investments measured at the lower of cost or market value.\n\n## 2. Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nUnder IFRS, debt instruments are measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the nature of the business  model  within  which  the  asset  is  held  and  the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset. Equity instruments are accounted for at FVTPL by UBS. Under Swiss GAAP, trading assets and derivatives are measured at FVTPL in line with IFRS. However, non-trading debt instruments are generally measured at amortized cost, even when the assets are managed on a fair value basis. In addition, the measurement of financial assets in the form of securities depends on the nature of the asset: debt instruments not held to maturity, i.e., instruments available for  sale,  and  equity  instruments  with  no  permanent  holding intent, are classified as Financial investments and measured at the lower  of  (amortized)  cost  or  market  value.  Market  value adjustments up to the original cost amount and realized gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are recorded in the income statement  as Other  income from ordinary  activities. Equity instruments with a permanent holding intent are classified as participations in Non-consolidated investments in subsidiaries and other participations and are measured at cost less impairment. Impairment  losses  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  as Impairment of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participations. Reversals of impairments up to the original cost amount and realized gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are recorded as Extraordinary income / Extraordinary expenses .\n\n## 3. Fair value option applied to financial liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS, UBS applies the fair value option to certain financial liabilities not held for trading. Instruments for which the fair value option is applied are accounted for at FVTPL. The amount of change in the fair value attributable to changes in UBS's own credit is presented in Other comprehensive income directly within Retained earnings . The fair value option is applied primarily to issued structured debt instruments, certain non-structured debt instruments, certain payables under repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lending agreements, amounts due under unit-linked investment contracts, and brokerage payables.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, the fair value option can only be applied to structured debt instruments consisting of a debt host contract and one or more embedded derivatives that do not relate to own equity. Furthermore, unrealized changes in fair value attributable to changes in UBS's own credit are not recognized, whereas realized own credit is recognized in Net trading income .\n\n## 4. Allowances and provisions for credit losses\n\nSwiss GAAP permit use of IFRS for accounting for allowances and provisions for credit losses based on an expected credit loss (ECL) model. UBS has chosen to apply the IFRS 9 ECL approach to the substantial majority of exposures in scope of Swiss GAAP ECL requirements, including all exposures in scope of ECL under both Swiss GAAP and IFRS.\n\nIn addition, for a small population of exposures within the scope of Swiss GAAP ECL requirements, which are not subject to ECL  under  IFRS  due  to  classification  and  measurements differences, UBS applies an alternative approach. Where Pillar 1 internal ratings-based (IRB) models are applied to measure credit risk, ECL for such exposures is determined by the regulatory expected loss (EL), with an add-on for scaling up to the residual maturity of exposures maturing beyond the next 12 months. For detailed  information  on  regulatory  EL,  refer  to  the  'Risk management and control' section of this report. For exposures where the Pillar 1 standardized approach (SA) is used to measure credit risk, ECL is determined using a portfolio approach that derives a conservative probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for the entire portfolio.\n\n## 5. Hedge accounting\n\nUnder IFRS, when cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the fair value  gain  or  loss  on  the  effective  portion  of  a  derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized initially in equity and reclassified to the income statement when certain conditions are met. When fair value hedge accounting is applied, the fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is  reflected  in  the  measurement  of  the  hedged  item  and  is recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative. Under Swiss GAAP, the effective  portion  of  the  fair  value  change  of  a  derivative instrument designated as a cash flow or as a fair value hedge is deferred on the balance sheet as Other assets or Other liabilities . The carrying amount of the hedged item designated in fair value hedges is not adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the hedged risk.",

        "page_content": "## Note 35  Main differences between IFRS and Swiss GAAP (continued)\n\n## 6. Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nUnder IFRS, goodwill acquired in a business combination is not amortized but tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are also not amortized but tested annually  for  impairment.  Under  Swiss  GAAP,  goodwill  and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are amortized over a period not exceeding five years, unless a longer useful life, which may not exceed 10 years, can be justified. In addition, these assets are tested annually for impairment.\n\n## 7. Post-employment benefit plans\n\nSwiss GAAP permit the use of IFRS or Swiss accounting standards for post-employment benefit plans, with the election made on a plan-by-plan basis.\n\nUBS has elected to apply IFRS (IAS 19) for the non-Swiss defined  benefit  plans  in  the  UBS  AG  standalone  financial statements and Swiss GAAP (FER 16) for the Swiss pension plan in the UBS AG and the UBS Switzerland AG standalone financial statements. The requirements of Swiss GAAP are better aligned with the specific nature of Swiss pension plans, which are hybrid in  that  they  combine  elements  of  defined  contribution  and defined benefit plans, but are treated as defined benefit plans under IFRS. Key differences between Swiss GAAP and IFRS include the treatment of dynamic elements, such as future salary increases and future interest credits on retirement savings, which are not considered under the static method used in accordance with Swiss  GAAP.  Also,  the  discount  rate  used  to  determine  the defined benefit obligation in accordance with IFRS is based on the yield  of  high-quality  corporate  bonds  of  the  market  in  the respective  pension  plan  country.  The  discount  rate  used  in accordance with Swiss GAAP (i.e., the technical interest rate) is determined  by  the  Pension  Foundation  Board  based  on  the expected returns of the Board's investment strategy.\n\nFor defined benefit plans, IFRS require the full defined benefit obligation net of the plan assets to be recorded on the balance sheet subject to the asset ceiling rules, with changes resulting from remeasurements recognized directly in equity. However, for non-Swiss defined benefit plans for which IFRS accounting is elected, changes due to remeasurements are recognized in the income statement of UBS AG standalone under Swiss GAAP.\n\nSwiss GAAP require employer contributions to the pension fund to be recognized as personnel expenses in the income statement. Swiss GAAP also require an assessment of whether, based on the pension fund's financial statements prepared in accordance  with  Swiss  accounting  standards  (FER  26),  an economic benefit to, or obligation of, the employer arises from the pension fund that is recognized in the balance sheet when conditions are met. Conditions for recording a pension asset or liability would be met if, for example, an employer contribution reserve is available or the employer is required to contribute to the reduction of a pension deficit (on an FER 26 basis).\n\n## 8. Leasing\n\nUnder IFRS, a single lease accounting model applies that requires UBS to record a right-of-use (RoU) asset and a corresponding lease\n\nliability on the balance sheet when UBS is a lessee in a lease arrangement. The RoU asset and the lease liability are recognized when UBS acquires control of the physical use of the asset. The lease liability is measured based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using UBS's unsecured borrowing rate. The RoU asset is recorded at an amount equal to the lease liability but is adjusted for rent prepayments, initial direct costs, any costs to refurbish the leased asset and / or lease incentives received. The RoU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards, but not necessarily legal title in the underlying assets,  are  classified  as  finance  leases.  All  other  leases  are classified  as  operating  leases.  Whereas  finance  leases  are recognized on the balance sheet and measured in line with IFRS, operating leases are not recognized on the balance sheet, with payments recognized as General and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term, which commences with control of the physical use of the asset. Lease incentives are treated as a reduction of rental expense and recognized on a consistent basis over the lease term.\n\n## 9. Netting of derivative assets and liabilities\n\nUnder IFRS, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market are reported on a gross basis unless  the  restrictive  IFRS  netting  requirements  are  met:  (i) existence of master netting agreements and related collateral arrangements that are unconditional and legally enforceable, in both the normal course of business and the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS and its counterparties; and (ii) UBS's intention to either settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and  settle  the  liability  simultaneously.  Under  Swiss  GAAP, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market are generally reported on a net basis, provided the master netting and the related collateral agreements are legally enforceable in the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS's counterparties.\n\n## 10. Negative interest\n\nUnder IFRS, negative interest income arising on a financial asset does not meet the definition of interest income and, therefore, negative interest on financial assets and negative interest on financial  liabilities  are  presented  within  interest  expense  and interest income, respectively. Under Swiss GAAP, negative interest on  financial  assets  is  presented  within  interest  income  and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented within interest expense.\n\n## 11. Extraordinary income and expense\n\nCertain non-recurring and non-operating income and expense items,  such  as  realized  gains  or  losses  from  the  disposal  of participations,  fixed  and  intangible  assets,  and  reversals  of impairments of participations and fixed assets, are classified as extraordinary items under Swiss GAAP. This distinction is not available under IFRS. \uf070",

The portion of the dividend paid out of total profit will be subject to a 35% Swiss withholding tax.\n\nThe ordinary dividend distribution is declared in US dollars. Shareholders whose shares are held through SIX SIS AG will receive dividends in Swiss francs, based on a published exchange rate calculated up to five decimal places on the day prior to the ex-dividend date. Shareholders holding shares through DTC or directly registered in the US share register with Computershare will be paid dividends in US dollars. The total amount of the dividend distribution will be capped at CHF 3,400 million (the\n\nCap). To the extent that the Swiss franc equivalent of the total dividend distribution would exceed the Cap on the day of the AGM, based on the exchange rate determined by the Board of Directors in its reasonable opinion, the US dollar per share amount of the dividend will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the total Swiss franc amount does not exceed the Cap.\n\nProvided that the proposed dividend distribution out of the total profit and the capital contribution reserve is approved, the payment of the dividend will be made on 14 April 2022 to holders of shares on the record date of 13 April 2022. The shares will be traded ex-dividend as of 12 April 2022 and, accordingly, the last day on which the shares may be traded with entitlement to receive the dividend will be 11 April 2022.",

UBS Group AG operates under Art. 620 et seq. of the  Swiss  Code  of  Obligations  as  an Aktiengesellschaft (a corporation limited by shares).\n\nUBS Group AG is the ultimate holding company of the UBS Group,  the  grantor  of  the  majority  of  UBS's  deferred compensation plans and the issuer of loss-absorbing capital notes which qualify as Basel III additional tier 1 (AT1) capital on a consolidated UBS Group basis and senior unsecured debt which contributes to the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) of the Group.\n\nThe proceeds from the issuances of loss-absorbing AT1 capital notes and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments are on-lent to UBS AG.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Notes 15 and 17 for more information about the main terms and conditions of the loss-absorbing AT1 capital notes and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments issued\n\nFurthermore,  UBS  Group  AG  grants  Deferred  Contingent Capital Plan (DCCP) awards to UBS Group employees. These DCCP awards also qualify as Basel III AT1 capital on a consolidated UBS Group basis.\n\nIn 2021, as approved by the Annual General Meeting held on 8 April 2021, the cancellation of 156,632,400 shares, each with a nominal value of CHF 0.10, purchased under the 2018-2021 share repurchase program, was executed. The cancellation of shares resulted in reclassifications within equity but had no net effect on the total equity attributable to shareholders. Share capital was reduced by the nominal value of the repurchased shares upon cancellation, i.e., USD 16 million (CHF 16 million). Following the requirements of the Swiss tax law for Switzerlanddomiciled  companies  with  shares  listed  on  a  Swiss  stock exchange,  effective  1  January  2020,  the  capital  contribution reserve was reduced by 50% of the total capital reduction amount exceeding the nominal value upon cancellation of the shares repurchased from 2020 onward, i.e., USD 236 million (CHF 224 million).  The  voluntary  earnings  reserve  was  reduced  by  the remaining  portion  of  the  total  capital  reduction  amount exceeding the nominal  value upon  cancellation of the repurchased shares, i.e., USD 1,792 million (CHF 1,762 million).\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, UBS Group AG ' s distributable items for the purpose of AT1 capital instruments were USD 40.3 billion (CHF 36.7 billion) (31 December 2020: USD 39.5 billion (CHF 35.0  billion)).  For  this  purpose,  distributable  items  are defined in the terms and conditions of the relevant instruments as the aggregate of (i) net profits carried forward and (ii) freely distributable reserves, in each case less any amounts that must be contributed to legal reserves under applicable law.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2  Accounting policies\n\nThe UBS Group AG standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance with the principles of the Swiss law on accounting and  financial  reporting  (32nd  title  of  the  Swiss  Code  of Obligations).\n\nThe functional currency of UBS Group AG is the US dollar. The significant  accounting  and  valuation  principles  applied  are described below.\n\n## Presentation currencies\n\nAs the primary presentation currency of the standalone financial statements of UBS Group AG is the US dollar, amounts in Swiss francs are additionally presented for each component of the financial statements. UBS Group AG applies the modified closing rate method for converting US dollar amounts into Swiss francs: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate, equity positions at historic rates and income and expense items at the weighted  average  rate  for  the  period.  All  resulting  currency translation effects are recognized separately in Voluntary earnings reserve , amounting to a negative currency translation effect of CHF 2,808 million as of 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: negative CHF 3,867 million).\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currency are translated into US  dollars  at  the  spot  exchange  rate  on  the  date  of  the transaction. At the balance sheet date, all current assets and short-term liabilities, as well as Financial assets measured at fair value that are denominated in a foreign currency, are translated into US dollars using the closing exchange rate. For Other noncurrent assets and long-term liabilities, where the asset mirrors the terms of a corresponding liability or the asset and liability otherwise form an economic hedge relationship, the asset and liability are treated as one unit of account for foreign currency translation purposes, with offsetting unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses based on the closing exchange rate presented  net  in  the  income  statement. Investments  in subsidiaries measured at historic cost are translated at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Currency translation effects from dividends paid in Swiss francs are recognized in equity. All other currency translation effects are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe main currency translation rates used by UBS Group AG are provided in Note 33 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities include investments in alternative investment vehicles (AIVs) with a short-term holding period. The holding period is deemed short term if the vesting of the awards hedged by the AIV is within 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are equity instruments and are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market prices\n\nas of the balance sheet date. Gains and losses resulting from fair value changes are recognized in Financial income and Financial expenses, respectively.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets include investments in AIVs with a long-term holding period. The holding period is deemed long term if the vesting of the awards hedged by the AIV is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are equity instruments and are measured at fair value based on their quoted market prices or other observable market prices as of the balance sheet date. Gains and losses resulting from fair value changes are recognized in Financial income and Financial expenses, respectively.\n\nInvestments in AIVs that have no quoted market price or no other observable market price are recognized as Financial assets and  are  measured  at  their  acquisition  cost  adjusted  for impairment losses.\n\nFinancial assets further include loans granted to UBS AG that substantially mirror the terms of the perpetual AT1 capital notes and the TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments issued, as well as fixed-term deposits with UBS AG with maturities more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. The loans and deposits are measured at nominal value.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 14 for more information\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nUBS Group AG uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency risks from investments in foreign subsidiaries. The  derivative  instruments  are  entered  into  with  UBS  AG, mirroring the conditions of the closing transactions UBS AG enters into with third parties.\n\nDerivative instruments are measured at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market prices as of the balance sheet date. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized on the balance sheet as Accrued income and prepaid expenses and Accrued expenses and deferred income , respectively. Corresponding gains and losses resulting from fair value changes are  recognized  in Financial  income and Financial  expenses, respectively.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are equity interests that are held to carry on the business of the UBS Group or for other strategic purposes. They include all subsidiaries directly held by UBS Group AG through which UBS conducts its business on a global basis. The investments are measured individually and carried at cost less impairment.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 13 for more information\n- \u203a Refer to Note 2 in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for a description of businesses of the UBS Group",

        "page_content": "## Long-term interest-bearing liabilities\n\nLong-term  interest-bearing  liabilities  include  perpetual  lossabsorbing capital notes that qualify as Basel III AT1 capital and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments at Group level. They are measured at nominal value. Any difference to nominal value, e.g., premium, discount or external costs that are directly related to the issue, is deferred as Accrued income and prepaid expenses or Accrued  expenses  and  deferred  income and amortized to Financial expenses or Financial income over the maturity of the instrument or until the first call date or optional redemption date, where applicable.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 17 for more information\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares acquired by UBS Group AG are recognized at acquisition  cost  and  are  presented  as  a  deduction  from shareholders' equity.\n\nUpon disposal of treasury shares or settlement of related sharebased awards, any realized gain or loss is recognized in Voluntary earnings reserve . Realized gains and losses from settlement of share-based  awards  represent  the  difference  between  the acquisition cost of the UBS Group AG shares and the grant date fair  value  of  the  share-based  awards.  For  the  year  ended 31 December 2021, a net gain of USD 9 million (CHF 8 million) from  settlement  of  share-based  awards  was  recognized  in Voluntary earnings reserve (2020 comparative period: net gain of USD  38 million (CHF 37 million)).\n\nFor UBS Group AG shares acquired by a direct or indirect subsidiary,  a Reserve  for  own  shares  held  by  subsidiaries is generally created in UBS Group AG's equity. However, where UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG acquire UBS Group AG shares and hold such in their trading portfolios, no Reserve for own shares held by subsidiaries is created.\n\n- \u203a Refer to Note 20 for more information\n\n## Share-based and other deferred compensation plans\n\n## Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe  grant  date  fair  value  of  equity-settled share-based compensation  awards  granted  to  employees  is  generally recognized over the vesting period of the awards. Awards granted in the form of UBS Group AG shares and notional shares are settled by delivering UBS Group AG shares at vesting except in jurisdictions where this is not permitted for legal or tax reasons. They are recognized as Compensation-related long-term liabilities\n\nif vesting is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date or as Accrued expenses and deferred income if vesting is within 12 months of the balance sheet date. The amount recognized is adjusted  for  forfeiture  assumptions,  such  that  the  amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service conditions at the vesting date. The grant date fair value is based on the UBS Group AG share price on the date of grant, taking into consideration post-vesting sale and hedge restrictions, dividend rights, non-vesting conditions and market conditions, where applicable.\n\nUpon settlement of the share-based awards, any realized gain or loss on the treasury shares is recognized in Voluntary earnings reserve . Realized gains and losses from settlement of share-based awards represent the difference between the acquisition cost of the UBS Group AG shares and the grant date fair value of the share-based awards.\n\n## Other deferred compensation plans\n\nDeferred compensation plans that are not share-based, including DCCP awards and awards in the form of AIVs, are accounted for as cash-settled awards. The present value or fair value of the amount payable to employees that is settled in cash is recognized as a liability generally over the vesting period, as Compensationrelated long-term liabilities if vesting is more than 12 months after the balance sheet date and as Accrued expenses and deferred income if vesting is within 12 months from the balance sheet date. The liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date at the present value of the corresponding DCCP award and the fair value of investments in AIVs. Gains and losses resulting from remeasurement of the liabilities are recognized in Other operating income and Other operating expenses , respectively.\n\n## Recharge of compensation expenses\n\nExpenses related to deferred compensation plans are recharged by UBS Group AG to its subsidiaries employing the personnel. Upon recharge, UBS Group AG recognizes a receivable from its subsidiaries corresponding to a liability representing its obligation toward the employees.\n\n## Dispensations in the standalone financial statements\n\nAs UBS Group AG prepares consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, UBS Group AG is exempt from various disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The dispensations include the management report and the statement of cash flows, as well as certain note disclosures.",

Nominee companies that cannot autonomously decide how voting rights are exercised are not required to notify the company and SIX if they reach, exceed or fall below the aforementioned thresholds.\n\nPursuant to the Swiss Code of Obligations, UBS Group AG discloses in its financial statements the identity of any shareholder with a holding of more than 5% of the total share capital of UBS Group AG.\n\n## Shareholders subject to FMIA disclosure notifications\n\nAccording to the mandatory FMIA disclosure notifications filed with  UBS  Group  AG  and  SIX,  as  of  31 December 2021,  the following entities held more than 3% of the total share capital of UBS  Group  AG:  Massachusetts  Financial  Services  Company, Boston, which disclosed a holding of 3.01% on 22 June 2021; Artisan Partners Limited Partnership, Milwaukee, which disclosed a holding of 3.15% on 18 November 2020; BlackRock Inc., New York, which disclosed a holding of 4.70% on 26 May 2020; and Norges Bank, Oslo, which disclosed a holding of 3.01% on 24 July\n\n2019.

Box CH-4002 Basle\n\nTo the General Meeting of\n\nUBS Group AG, Zurich\n\nBasel, 4 March 2022\n\n## Report of the statutory auditor on the financial statements\n\nAs statutory auditor, we have audited the financial statements of UBS Group AG, which comprise the balance sheet, income statement and notes, for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibility\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of Sw iss law and the company's articles of incorporation. This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of incorporation.\n\n## Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. We have determined that there are no key audit matters to communicate in our report.\n\nPhone:\n\n+41 58 286 86 86\n\nFax:\n\n+41 58 286 86 00\n\nwww.ey.com/ch",

Many  of  these  subsidiaries  are  subject  to regulations requiring compliance with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements. The table in this section summarizes the regulatory capital components and capital ratios of our significant regulated  subsidiaries  and  sub-groups  determined  under  the regulatory framework of each subsidiary's or sub-group's home jurisdiction.\n\n- \u203a Refer to 'Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries' in the 'Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet' section of this report for more information\n- \u203a Refer to 'Note 23 Restricted and transferred financial assets' in the 'Consolidated financial statements' section of this report for more information.\n\nSupervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher  requirements  or  to  otherwise  limit  the  activities  of subsidiaries. Supervisory authorities also may require entities to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis and may limit the ability of an entity to engage in new activities or take capital actions based on the results of those tests.\n\nEffective 1 October 2021, UBS Americas Holding LLC is subject to  a  stress  capital  buffer  (an  SCB)  of  7.1%,  in  addition  to minimum capital requirements. The SCB was determined by the Federal Reserve  Board  following  the  completion  of  the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (based on DoddFrank  Act  Stress  Test  (DFAST)  results  and  planned  future dividends). The SCB, which replaces the static capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, is subject to change on an annual basis or as otherwise determined by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nStandalone  regulatory  information  for  UBS  AG  and  UBS Switzerland AG, as well as consolidated regulatory information for UBS Europe SE and UBS Americas Holding LLC, is provided in the 31 December 2021 Pillar 3 Report, available under 'Pillar 3 disclosures' at ubs.com/investors .\n\nStandalone financial statements for UBS Group AG, as well as standalone  financial  statements  and  regulatory  information  for UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG, are available under 'Holding company and significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups' at ubs.com/investors.",

        "page_content": "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements | This report contains statements that constitute 'forward-looking statements,' including but not limited to management's outlook for UBS's financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on UBS's business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking statements represent UBS's judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS's expectations. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to heightened volatility across global markets and to the coordinated implementation of sanctions on Russia, Russian entities and nationals. Russia's invasion of Ukraine already has caused significant population displacement, and as the conflict continues, the disruption will likely increase. The scale of the conflict and the speed and extent of sanctions, as well as the uncertainty as to how the situation will develop, may have significant adverse effects to the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to manage it have had and may also continue to have a significant adverse effect on global and regional economic activity, including disruptions to global supply chains, inflationary pressures, and labor market displacements. Factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the ongoing execution of its strategic plans, including its cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility; (ii) the degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions; (iii) the continuing low or negative interest rate environment in Switzerland and other jurisdictions; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, and currency exchange rates, and the effects of economic conditions, market developments, and increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS's clients and counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any changes in UBS's credit spreads and ratings, as well as availability and cost of funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC); (vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the European Union and other financial centers that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect these will or would have on UBS's business activities; (vii) UBS's ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS Group in response to legal and regulatory requirements, or other external developments; (viii) UBS's ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with sanctions and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS's competitive position, including whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS's ability to compete in certain lines of business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the operational risk component of our RWA, as well as the amount of capital available for return to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS's cross-border banking business of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in UBS's policies and practices relating to this business; (xiv) UBS's ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS's ability to implement new technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS's internal processes for risk management, risk control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from nation states and while COVID-19 control measures require large portions of the staff of both UBS and its service providers to work remotely; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG to make payments or distributions, including due to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by FINMA or the regulators of UBS's operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS's ability to maintain its stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others to achieve goals relating to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and governmental standards;
