Management provided comprehensive support for the physical and mental well-being of our employees during this challenging period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.\n- 1.  See cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 111.\n- 2.  Operating cash /flow refers to net cash in/flow from operating activities as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 144.\n- 3.  TSR represents the total accumulated value delivered to shareholders (via gross dividends reinvested and share appreciation). Details of how non-GAAP measures are calculated are set out on pages 219 to 223.\n\n## A Record Financial Performance\n\n2021 saw a record /financial performance for CRH, attributable to the hard work of our employees, the consistent execution of our clear, focused strategy, the resilience and /flexibility of the Group's business model and ongoing initiatives to enhance and improve business and operational performance.\n\nThese results also re/flect the value which customers place on the depth and breadth of CRH's products and the expertise with which its skilled employees provide solutions for customers' needs in a fast-evolving construction environment.\n\nCRH grew its revenues, pro/fit, margins, cash generation and returns on capital during 2021 with Operating Cash Flow 2 of $4.2 billion (2020: $3.9 billion) arising from record EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $5.35 billion (2020: $4.6 billion), enabling, amongst other investment activities, capital expenditure of $1.6 billion (2020: $1.0 billion) in existing businesses.\n\nCRH continues to actively manage its portfolio of businesses, assessing the ability of each business to continue to contribute to CRH's long-term strategy and evaluating the potential for acquisitions to enhance our business platforms through the provision of value-added solutions for customers.\n\nThe strength of CRH's business model, balance sheet and cash generation provide the Board with signi/ficant optionality to invest in businesses which /fit our clearly de/fined strategy and which can generate enhanced value for our shareholders. During 2021, CRH invested $1.5 billion (2020: $0.4 billion) on acquisitions and we have a strong pipeline of development opportunities.\n\nFurther details on the record performance in 2021 and implementation of CRH's value creation strategy are set out in the Chief Executive's report on pages 10 to 11.\n\n## Delivering Cash Returns And Capital Growth For Shareholders\n\nDividends paid to CRH shareholders with respect to the 2020 /financial year of 115.0c per share represented an increase of 25% compared to the total dividends per share declared for the 2019 /financial year. In addition, during 2021 CRH continued its share buyback programme, investing $0.9 billion (2020: $0.2 billion).\n\nRe/flecting your Board's con/fidence in CRH and its future prospects, and our objective of continuing to have a sustainable, progressive dividend policy, the Board is recommending a /final dividend of 98.0c for the 2021 /financial year. This represents a total dividend of 121.0c per share for the 2021 /financial year, an increase of 5% compared to 2020. Since 1970 CRH's compound annual Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') 3 has been 15.5% (2020: 15.1%).\n\nAt the 2022 Annual General Meeting, the Board will seek a renewal of the annual authority enabling the Board to continue with the share buyback programme.",

        "page_content": "## Health & Safety A Continuing Priority\n\nIn relation to COVID-19, the Board regularly monitored CRH's approach, initiatives and the outcomes therefrom against available research, best practice and the experiences of the wider populations where our businesses are located.\n\nThe safety of our employees and contractors continued to receive attention during the year. Through the Board's Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility (SESR) Committee we inputted into policies and practices relating to safety, culture and monitored performance. Notwithstanding this focus, very sadly, there were four workplace related fatalities in 2021. The background to, and the potential learnings from, each accident was carefully examined by the SESR Committee and the full Board.\n\nThe Board offers its sympathy to the families of any CRH employees and contractors who suffered bereavement as a result of COVID-19 or any other illness or as a consequence of a workplace accident.\n\nDuring 2021 CRH conducted a comprehensive Group-wide employee survey seeking insights into a wide range of matters relating to their experiences as employees. This survey was complemented by a series of direct engagements, with similar objectives, between the SESR Committee and groups of employees from across CRH. In assessing the relevant information gathered from the survey and direct engagement, the Committee was able to report to the Board that safety, employee health and well-being were recognised by employees as being very important priorities for CRH and that this, including how CRH has supported employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, is appreciated and valued.\n\nThe Board is actively monitoring the very recent developments in Ukraine with a focus on the safety and security of the c.800 people who work in our Ukrainian operations.\n\n## Delivering Against Challenging ESG Targets\n\nCRH is, and will continue to be, a leader in providing solutions in the built environment for the challenges and opportunities arising from mitigating and managing the impact of climate change and supporting environmentally sustainable economic growth.\n\nOur 2020 Sustainability Report set out challenging targets for mitigating our environmental impact, enhancing the contributions our products and customer-solutions make to the circular economy and sustainable economic growth, ensuring the safety of our people and progressing our inclusion and diversity (I&D) agenda.\n\nDuring 2021 we made positive progress against these targets and I am pleased to advise that\n\nwe expect to deliver on our decarbonisation target ahead of schedule. As a result, the SESR Committee has agreed with management and the Group has adopted an updated 2030 Group-wide carbon reduction target as set out on page 21.\n\nIn addition, to support our ongoing transparency on these matters, the Audit Committee oversaw the signi/ficant expansion of our disclosures in this document in line with the expectations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the emerging EU Taxonomy and further disclosures in respect of relevant accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nIn relation to diversity, as we develop our future leaders, we are focused on ensuring that CRH bene/fits from people with diverse backgrounds and experiences and has the structures in place to support them as they develop during their careers in the Group.\n\n## Your Board Making A Positive Contribution\n\nAs Chairman I am pleased to report that your Board continues to operate very effectively and cohesively in the ongoing assessment of strategy and business performance, the purpose and culture of CRH and the quality and contributions of its people. This is due to the experience and attributes of individual Directors and the collective efforts of a diverse team of people. The performance of the Board was evaluated by an external evaluator in 2021. This process similarly concluded that the Board was performing very effectively.\n\nDuring the year, Caroline Dowling and Badar Khan joined your Board bringing their relevant backgrounds, experiences and qualities to enhance the Board's overall makeup and ability to contribute.\n\nAfter a thorough process supported by an independent third party, which identi/fied and assessed potential external and internal candidates for the role, the Board unanimously decided to appoint Jim Mintern to the role of Finance Director of CRH and to the Board in June 2021.\n\nSince his appointment, the Group has bene/fited from the considerable strategic, /financial and operational experience which Jim brings to the role.\n\nAs is CRH's policy and practice, Caroline, Badar and Jim will retire at the AGM and along with all other current members of the Board will stand for re-election by shareholders. The background and experience of each Board member, along with CRH's policies and approach to ongoing Board assessment and renewal are covered in more detail in the Nomination and Governance Committee's Report on pages 70 to 75.\n\nLong-term succession planning for senior executive roles continued to be a core focus for the Board in 2021. Details in relation to the Board's approach to this important topic is set out in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Report on page 71.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement And Board Priorities\n\nI have again had the bene/fit of considerable engagement with CRH shareholders over the past 12 months, discussing with them progress against the Board's priorities. This has enabled me to gain a detailed understanding of their perspectives and thoughts on CRH. Reports of all shareholder engagements are shared with my colleagues on the Board.\n\nInformed by this shareholder engagement and the Board's deliberations, the Board's priorities during 2022 will include:\n\n- -    A continued focus on the ongoing safety of our people, monitoring and assessing the alignment of CRH's culture with our values and purpose, overseeing talent management and succession planning and ensuring that people with diverse backgrounds and experiences are actively encouraged and supported;\n- -   Ensuring that CRH continues to be a leader in managing the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of climate change and contributing to environmentally sustainable economic progress;\n- -   Encouraging and assessing management's ongoing initiatives to enhance and improve CRH's businesses and business performance, including the contributions of businesses working together in the provision of comprehensive customerfocused solutions;\n- -   Continuing to ensure that CRH has the appropriate, clearly communicated and shareholder-endorsed strategy and business model and capital allocation policy to support continued success and value creation.\n\nDelivery against these priorities will support CRH's responsibility to continue to provide attractive cash returns and capital growth to CRH's shareholders over the short, medium and long term. I look forward to continued engagement with CRH shareholders over the next year to report on and hear their views on progress against these priorities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite considerable external challenges, 2021 was another year of very strong delivery by CRH against its strategic and /financial objectives and goals.\n\nThis delivery was made possible by the dedication, skill and quality of CRH's people working together as a team and bene/fiting from the commitment, focus, inclusiveness, and strategic insights of our CEO, Albert Manifold. The Board is very appreciative of the contributions of all of the people in CRH to its success and is very encouraged for the future given their commitment to CRH and their capabilities and potential.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman\n\n2 March 2022",

Net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments.\n\n## An Evolving CRH\n\nMarket demand and societal expectation for building materials and products is evolving. As our climate changes there is an increased emphasis on the sustainability performance of structures and buildings on a full life-cycle basis. By combining our materials, products and services, including recycled end-of-life materials, into integrated solutions which can be delivered more ef/ficiently and sustainably, we can better serve the emerging needs of customers and support them in meeting the challenges of modern construction.\n\nWe continue to build out our integrated solutions strategy across our materials and products businesses. It is increasingly a differentiating feature of CRH's offering as we work closely with our customers to better understand and align with their speci/fic challenges. At the same time we continue our focus on innovation to deliver value added solutions that improve the life cycle performance of buildings and climate resilient infrastructure. This in turn has helped us to identify additional opportunities for growth and value creation. As a result, CRH continues to be a strong and resilient business, delivering a record /financial performance, with continued improvement in sales, pro/fitability and cash generation.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nIn many of our markets CRH has become a valued partner in the delivery of a safer and more resilient built environment that helps to mitigate the impacts of climate change on communities.\n\nWe also recognise the importance of decarbonisation in addressing the challenges of climate change. We have a long track record in successful emissions reduction initiatives and we recently set ourselves a new, industry leading target to reduce our Group's absolute carbon emissions by 25% by 2030. For further information on this target please refer to page 21.\n\nWe will continue to strive for further improvements across our operating footprint in support of our ambition to become a net-zero business by 2050.\n\nAs CRH and the world around us transitions to a low carbon economy over the coming decades, how we navigate climate-related risks and opportunities will be increasingly important. Information on how our disclosures meet the requirements of the TCFD is included on pages 28 to 31.\n\n## Performance Highlights\n\nIn 2021 CRH bene/fited from recovering market demand as economies reopened and construction activity returned to more normal levels.

On a like-for-like 1 basis EBITDA (as de/fined)* was 11% ahead of 2020, while EBITDA (as de/fined)* margin of 17.3% (2020: 16.8%) increased by 50 basis points.\n\nNet debt of $6.3 billion at year end (2020: $5.9 billion) re/flects strong in/flows from operations, disciplined capital expenditure and value focused investments. The Group's Net Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)* 2 was 1.2x (2020: 1.3x) at year end.\n\nPro/fit after tax was signi/ficantly ahead of 2020 at $2.6 billion (2020: $1.2 billion) driven by a strong trading performance and the non-recurrence of non-cash impairment charges and one-off restructuring costs in the prior year. Earnings per share (EPS) for the year was 130% higher than 2020 at 328.8c (2020: 142.9c), re/flecting a strong trading performance and the non-recurrence of non-cash impairment charges and restructuring charges in the prior year. This represented a 35% increase on a pre-impairment basis (2020 EPS pre-impairment: 243.3c). Our relentless focus on continuous business improvement helped contribute to a further increase in returns. RONA for the year was 12.3% (2020: 10.1%).\n\n## Operational Highlights\n\nIn our Americas Materials Division, solid volumes, pricing progression and good operating performance resulted in EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $2.6 billion (2020: $2.4 billion) up 7% on a like-for-like basis with sales of $12.4 billion (2020: $11.3 billion).\n\nIn Europe Materials, EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $1.4 billion (2020: $1.1 billion) on sales of $10.6 billion (2020: $9.1 billion) was 22% ahead of prior year on a like-for-like basis re/flecting good volume growth and price progress against a prior year comparative that was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStrong demand for residential construction drove increased sales across all platforms in our Building Products Division, which reported sales of $8.0 billion (2020: $7.2 billion) with EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $1.4 billion (2020: $1.2 billion) 8% ahead on a like-for-like basis.\n\nAcross all of our divisions positive pricing actions, cost savings and performance initiatives helped to minimise the impact of a challenging in/flationary environment.\n\n## Portfolio Management And Capital Allocation\n\nWe continued to maintain our disciplined and value-focused approach to capital allocation. Development activity returned to more normal levels as visibility improved and COVID-19 related disruption eased. During the year the Group invested $1.5 billion (2020: $0.4 billion) in 20 bolt-on acquisitions. This included the addition of businesses such as National Pipe & Plastics (NPP) in the United States (US) which further enhance our end-to-end solutions offering to our customers.\n\nTotal proceeds from business divestments and asset disposals 3 was $0.5 billion (2020: $0.3 billion) including the sale of our Brazil cement operations for a total consideration of $0.2 billion.\n\nWe also continued our share buyback programme with a further $0.9 billion (2020: $0.2 billion) of shares repurchased during 2021, re/flecting CRH's strong /financial position and commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nOn 28 February 2022, the Group entered into a binding agreement to divest of its Building Envelope business to KPS Capital Partners, LP for an enterprise value of $3.8 billion. The transaction is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals. The decision to divest, at an attractive valuation, follows a comprehensive review of the business and demonstrates CRH's active approach to portfolio management, the ef/ficient allocation of capital and the creation of a simpler and more focused Group.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is deeply embedded in our business strategy, ensuring that CRH continues to prosper and grow in the long term. We believe that our actions have a positive impact on the world around us. In 2021 this included further increases in our use of alternative and recycled materials in our products and integrated building solutions, and increasing the amount of revenue attributable to sustainable products.\n\n## Safety\n\nWe continue to maintain our uncompromising approach to ensuring the health and safety of our employees, contractors, customers and the general public. In 2021 this included the further development of best practice safety management systems and health and wellbeing programmes across all our locations.\n\nDespite our best efforts I regret to report that there were four workplace related fatalities in 2021, one of which involved an employee at one of our facilities and three road traf/fic incidents involving the fatality of a contractor and two third parties.\n\n## Our People\n\nThe record performance achieved in 2021 is testament to the hard work, commitment and resilience of each and every one of our employees, who despite the challenging backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, continued to deliver for the customers and communities that depend on us. We are fortunate to have an exceptionally talented and diverse team operating across our global business. As our business evolves, so do the demands on our leadership team. To deliver differently we must organise differently. In 2021 Randy Lake was appointed Chief Operating Of/ficer, responsible for ongoing business improvement, formulating and executing our climate strategy, ensuring we align our teams and processes to drive innovation, and positioning CRH for further growth and the achievement of its full potential. I am also pleased to report that 2021 saw CRH continue to make progress on building a more inclusive company, one which fosters a sense of belonging and empowers people to be their best. Our agenda for change in this area is Chief Executive led and remains a top priority for CRH.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe expect the underlying demand and pricing backdrop to remain favourable in 2022 albeit against an in/flationary input cost environment and continued supply chain challenges. Our Americas Materials Division bene/fits from continuing favourable economic conditions and strong market positions. Federal funding for infrastructure is underpinned by the passing of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package by the US Congress, while the residential market is expected to continue to grow driven by robust demand. The backdrop in Europe is expected to be positive with continued growth in our key markets. In our Europe Materials Division, we continue to bene/fit from strong market positions in growing economies in Eastern Europe and attractive markets in Western Europe. Although cost in/flation headwinds are anticipated to continue in the near-term, we expect to deliver further progress in 2022 supported by good demand and commercial discipline. We expect our Building Products Division to deliver further growth supported by good commercial management, increased activity and continued cost saving initiatives. Although there are a number of challenges and uncertainties across our markets, CRH's uniquely integrated and value-added solutions strategy, together with a strong and /flexible balance sheet, leaves us well positioned for another year of progress.\n\n## Albert Manifold\n\nChief Executive\n\n2 March 2022",

Market fundamentals including population and economic growth, drive demand for CRH's materials, products and solutions.\n\nCRH is the global leader in building materials, serving the needs of the construction industry in 28 countries around the world.\n\nWe support the delivery of critical infrastructure required for society to function. As communities develop, populations grow and economic activity increases, so too does demand for our materials, products and customer-focused solutions.\n\nCRH is ideally positioned to service the demand requirements of construction projects in local markets through its extensive network of mineral reserves, production, manufacturing and logistics assets which are strategically located in mature attractive construction markets globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Demand Fundamentals\n\nAt CRH we aim to have a portfolio which is appropriately exposed to each of of the following three primary demand fundamentals, thereby ensuring we bene/fit from growth and value-creation opportunities associated with each.\n\n## Population Growth\n\nBy 2050 an estimated additional two billion people will have been added to the global population. The majority of these people will live in towns and cities as part of the estimated 68% of the world's population that will live in towns and cities by then.\n\nOur materials, products and solutions play an important role in shaping the built environment in these urban areas. This means there is a natural market for our products wherever there is growth in population. The associated construction demand can be expected to drive day-to-day organic growth for our businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic Development\n\nConstruction-related spending currently accounts for c. 13% of global GDP. Economic development and growth drives investment in residential, infrastructure and commercial projects from the houses, roads, bridges, ports and airports that serve our growing cities to of/fice blocks, retail centres and industrial and leisure complexes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ongoing Repair & Maintenance\n\nThere is a recurring need to continually repair and maintain the existing built environment as structures age over time.",

We prudently allocate capital to the parts of our business that are positively exposed to fundamental demand drivers that can be expected to persist and create value for CRH in the medium to long-term.\n\nOur vertically integrated business model and unique integrated solutions strategy enhances our ability to complement organic growth by identifying suitable businesses which can be acquired and seamlessly integrated into CRH.\n\nThrough our enduring relationships and deep market insight we identify and acquire established businesses with a proven track record of performance and a capacity to hold strong leadership positions in local markets.\n\nThe extensive footprint of our materials businesses in North America and Europe sees us well positioned to capitalise on value creating opportunities for market consolidation and expansion of existing operations.\n\n## North America\n\nIn North America, which includes the world's largest economy, the US, CRH is the largest building materials business. Growth in North America is underpinned by a population that grows by 25 million people every decade, driving associated construction growth. The market for materials remains largely unconsolidated. For example, the top ten aggregates businesses account for less than one third of production.\n\nIn recent years we have reshaped and redirected our businesses in the US to increase CRH's exposure to positive demand fundamentals in the southern and western areas of the country.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Integrated Solutions Strategy\n\nAs the nature of construction changes customers are increasingly demanding more holistic solutions which reduce cost, time and complexity and can improve the overall environmental performance of a project.\n\nThe 'building site' has evolved into the 'assembly site' with more and more of the actual construction carried out in specialised locations off-site before completed structural elements are transported and lifted into place on-site.\n\nBecause of the breadth of materials we produce, CRH is uniquely positioned to service the demand to develop these customer focused solutions, which integrate multiple different materials to service the more complex needs of our customers.\n\nOur effectiveness in meeting this evolving demand has become a major driver of growth and pro/fitability for CRH.\n\nA signi/ficant portion of our business today can be categorised as either value-added products or integrated building solutions. This means for the bulk of our customers, CRH is no longer a provider of a single type of product or a particular material. Instead we are providing complete or integrated solutions, incorporating multiple materials and value-added expertise.\n\nThis in turn broadens our exposure along the value chain, and importantly opens up new opportunities for growth and value creation, as construction continues to change and demand for integrated building solutions increases.\n\nThe move from individual products to integrated building solutions requires a breadth of expertise, businesses and products, as well as market scale and customer insight. CRH is uniquely positioned in this regard and consequently holds a signi/ficant competitive advantage.\n\n## Europe\n\nCRH is a leading building materials business in Europe where the European Union (EU) is the largest economic bloc in the world. In Europe, there is an attractive mix of stable, developed markets which continue to deliver along with less developed, higher growth markets which offer opportunities for organic growth and acquisition activity.\n\n## Other Markets\n\nOur Building Products Division produces high value-added, highly engineered products some of which can be economically transported over long distances, opening up important export markets for CRH beyond our core geographic footprint.\n\nOngoing innovation and product development ensures that we meet the needs of customers today and also addresses the longer-term opportunities presented by economic development, changing demographics and investments in a sustainable future.",

To achieve this, we continue to develop our products to improve the life-cycle performance of buildings, provide innovative solutions for climate-resilient infrastructure and projects, and support our customers to meet the changing needs of modern construction.\n\n## Driving our sustainability agenda\n\nSustainability continues to be at the core of our strategy. CRH is a sustainability leader in our sector, as determined by the major Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) rating agencies. We are a constituent member of indices including the MSCI Leaders ESG Indexes, FTSE4Good Index, the STOXX \u00ae Global ESG Leaders Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are also a long-term participant in CDP (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project) and were awarded an A- for both our 2021 climate and water security disclosures.\n\n## Partnering for sustainable progress\n\nWe advance with intent and contribute to the delivery of global goals, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and the Paris Agreement. We recognise that partnership is key to progress in these areas.\n\nBy collaborating across the value chain with a wide range of stakeholders, we are helping to advance our shared priorities. For example we are a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA).\n\nIn responding to ESG trends, we also use our in/fluence and scale to promote sustainability initiatives by collaborating with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charitable organisations. In doing so we strengthen local relationships and champion the causes most important to society.\n\nOur contributions have been recognised and many of our operating companies have achieved awards for excellence in sustainability.",

Our non-/financial due diligence processes are well established in our business and supply chains, and we made no material changes to these in 2021.\n\nOur performance is monitored using KPIs across the areas of health and safety, social and environment. Our most relevant KPIs are provided on pages 18 and 20 to 26. We provide training to our employees to raise awareness of our performance standards and the importance of upholding them across our business.

These include annual sustainability reporting by our businesses to the Group, review of issues raised through ERM processes and regular formal materiality assessment reviews, the outcomes of which guide our strategy and reporting. This helps us respond to our customers' needs and develop the solutions needed to reduce the impact of construction on the environment.\n\nThese internal and external processes allow us to monitor opportunities and risks and articulate what matters most to society. They also assist us in identifying the areas in which we can create the most value and mitigate potential negative impacts that our operations may cause.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our stakeholder engagement see pages 26 and 27\n\nFor more on our disclosures consistent with TCFD see pages 28 to 31\n\n- *    The SBTi's Target Validation Team has classi/fied our Scope 1 and 2 target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a well-below 2\u00b0C trajectory.

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\n## How climate change impacts our strategy\n\nCRH is a global leader in sustainable building materials and addressing climate change is a cornerstone of our approach to sustainability. We strive to be a leader in the production of high-performing, climate-friendly materials and products aimed at climate adaptation and mitigation. By developing value-added products and services for sustainable building solutions, we aim to contribute to a better built environment, address potentially negative impacts of climate change and ensure the creation of long-term /financial and societal value.\n\nWe have provided two illustrative examples of how climate-related issues impact our businesses, strategy and /financial planning on the right of this page.\n\n## Strategic management of risks\n\nPotential strategic risks to CRH, including climate, are identi/fied, assessed and managed in line with our de/fined ERM to determine materiality and the potential timelines over which the strategic impact may materialise. In considering the impact, we utilise our strategic planning horizon (and split these internally into short-term (<1 year), medium-term (1 - 3 years) and long-term exposures (3 - 5 years).\n\nRisks may be evaluated as emerging (e.g. expected to occur over materially longer periods or exposures where the impact cannot yet be fully understood) informing, for example, the management of risks related to climate change and our associated 2050 ambition as well as our 2030 targets.\n\nUsing the risk identi/fication process outlined in 'Risk Management' on page 32, we have identi/fied several climate-related risks and opportunities within our strategic planning horizon. A selection of these can be seen in our climate scenario analysis disclosure on page 30. Additional strategic climate impacts, which may occur over the short-, medium- and long-term, including, acute, chronic, technology, legal, regulatory, market and reputation can be seen as part of our Form 20-F disclosure on page 235.\n\nThe process used to determine which risks and opportunities could have a material /financial impact can be seen in our Risk Management disclosure on this page.\n\nFurther information is included as part of our Risk Governance reporting on page 32.\n\n## Risk Management\n\n## Identifying climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nRisks are identi/fied through a number of different forums such as risk workshops, risk champion forums and engagement with senior leaders and other stakeholders. During 2021, as part of our continued commitment to understanding the potential climate-related risks and opportunities that CRH faces, we undertook a number of risk workshops focused on where climate-related risks could adversely impact the Group, and where we see potential opportunities for CRH to create value and contribute to the development of a more resilient built environment and a more sustainable future. The outputs of our workshops are included as part of our climate scenario analysis disclosure on page 30.\n\nA robust risk catalogue is used to inform our bottom-up risk identi/fication processes and ensure our businesses consider the full breadth of climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n## Assessing climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nClimate-related risks and opportunities are considered over our short-, medium- and long-term horizons. The Group operates a bottomup and top-down risk assessment process, thereby allowing risk information /flows from our Operating Companies to inform our Group-wide assessment and allowing key risk topics from a Group perspective to /filter down and inform local risk identi/fication and assessment. Common risk criteria and topic hierarchies are used to assess and consistently categorise risks and opportunities which helps identify and manage aggregate exposures that may be more effectively managed centrally.\n\nThe size and signi/ficance of each risk is determined according to the product of its assessed impact on the organisation and its likelihood of occurrence, with consideration of factors such as impact velocity, for example, informing the prioritisation of risks for subsequent management to within agreed acceptable levels. Our disclosure of climaterelated risks (see page 235) distinguishes between transitional and physical risks and associated risks within each category.\n\nWhile climate-related risks and opportunities are a speci/fic focus for CRH, they form part of a range of interconnected risks that the Group manages through our ERM framework. To understand more about our processes for identifying, assessing and managing risk, please see our Risk Governance section on page 32.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Future-proo/fing our business\n\nThroughout our business there is a constant focus on making our business more resilient and sustainable. This includes reducing emissions, increasing the use of alternative materials, accelerating sustainable product innovation and anticipating the evolving needs of our customers in response to the changing climate and weather patterns. Evidence of our on-going commitment to deliver a more resilient built environment was the strategic acquisition of NPP, Inc. during the year. This transaction strengthens CRH's ability to provide fully integrated solutions that connect and protect critical utility infrastructure and enhance the built environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Integration in our processes\n\nWe prioritise resource ef/ficiency, the use of recycled materials and the recyclability of products at end-of-life. For example, we support the circular economy through investment in our asphalt plants and processes to deliver higher levels of recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) into asphalt mixes.\n\nIn addition, we use an internal carbon price in relevant capital expenditure approval and strategic planning processes, with the aim of directing investments towards ef/ficiency, optimisation and lower-carbon solutions.",

CRH continually assesses its strategy, business model and ongoing business performance to make sure that they are driving sustainable growth and value creation for its stakeholders. As CRH continues to assess and re-assess its strategy and associated risks and opportunities, new risks and opportunities may become apparent attributable to climate, sustainability, or other topics that the Group considers as part of its strategic planning. Should such risks and opportunities be identi/fied, CRH's approach enables the Group to refresh elements of its strategy. Based on this initial assessment of the risks and opportunities that need to be managed, the Group do not believe that its business model would need to materially change.

Like all businesses, CRH faces a level of uncertainty in executing on our strategic objectives, inherently creating risks and opportunities. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is a critical tool in managing the uncertainties our business faces in our relentless focus on value-creation, protecting our people and generating long-term, sustainable growth.\n\n## Making Better Decisions\n\nERM is a process embedded throughout the Group which provides a structured and consistent global approach to identifying, assessing and managing our most material threats and opportunities. Ultimately, the purpose of ERM is to assist our people in making better decisions by focusing decision-makers on taking the right risk for the right reward, encouraging the effective and informed interaction with risk to protect and grow our business.\n\nOur framework, which is aligned to the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) principles, is embedded across the Group and is a key element in our decision-making practices.\n\nOur risk intelligent culture is key to embedding ERM into decision-making, and whilst accountability for the effective management of risk sits with leadership throughout the Group, all employees are encouraged to be risk managers and proactively manage risk.\n\nWe believe that the key to ensuring risk is managed effectively is to integrate ERM into our businesses' day-to-day decision-making activities. While formally considered as part of our strategic planning and budgeting processes, regular discussion on risk at management meetings drives day-to-day operational decisionmaking and enables our risk framework to be truly value-adding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk workshops, facilitated by Group Risk, bring together leaders from across the Group to identify risks and opportunities, and de/fine mitigation. Uncertainties that present themselves as downside risks are assessed in line with the Group's risk appetite and those which present themselves as opportunities are suf/ficiently explored and captured, where possible.\n\nOur risk appetite and tolerance framework is a critical element of our overall ERM framework, de/fining key risk parameters within which strategic decision-making takes place and assisting with our objectives of disciplined and focused growth. The Board determines our risk appetite against our strategic objectives and approves the framework on an annual basis in line with good corporate governance practice.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Process\n\n## Assessment\n\n## Management\n\n## Reporting\n\nIdenti/fied 'severe, but plausible risk events' are consistently assessed on inherent and residual bases across a number of risk lenses such as Health & Safety, Environmental, Climate and Financial, with equally weighted impact criteria thresholds de/fined for each. Consistent likelihood criteria are equally applied group wide.\n\n## ERM in Action\n\nERM is applied to strengthen our portfolio management processes to further enhance our con/fidence to undertake investments and step into new markets, such as our purchase of Pebble Technology International which represented strategic entry into a new adjacent outdoor category for our Architectural Products Group.\n\nOur framework allows us to add depth to our understanding of our customers and markets and generate new ways to meet their needs, and despite ongoing challenges, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our performance continues to highlight the resilience and agility of our people, our business model and our proven record of delivery through uncertainty.\n\n## Identi/fication\n\nBusinesses undertake bottom-up and top-down risk identi/fication activity to identify and quantify the risks and opportunities that could impact the delivery of strategic objectives, or the interests of our key stakeholder groups (e.g. our suppliers, shareholders, employees, customers, communities, environment and climate).\n\nRisks are evaluated against our appetite thresholds, objectively informing any subsequent response and/or required escalation to the relevant management and/or Board oversight committee. Formal processes are in place to monitor critical risks which feed into our risk reporting practices.\n\nOur enterprise risks are reported to the Risk Committee quarterly, as well as to the Audit Committee throughout the year. Any risks that warrant attention at other committees are discussed and decisions made at those committees (internal control and Sustainability risks, for example, being discussed at the Audit and SESR Committees respectively).",

Each of the above is dealt with in the following sections of this Annual Report and Form 20-F:\n\n## Current Position\n\n- -> Why Invest in CRH, page 8\n- -> Market Backdrop, page 12\n\n## Strategy & Business Model\n\n- -> Our Strategy, page 14\n- -> Business Model, page 16\n\n## Principal Risks\n\n- -> Key Performance Indicators, page 18\n- -> Principal Risks & Uncertainties, page 116\n\nThe Board's consideration of the long-term prospects of the Group is an extension of the strategic planning process. This process includes regular budget reviews as part of the internal reporting cycle, /financial forecasting and performance reviews, a comprehensive enterprise risk management assessment and scenario planning involving our principal risks and uncertainties. Our business strategy is focused on creating long-term value and delivering superior returns for all our stakeholders through disciplined capital management and operational ef/ficiency.\n\nIn assessing the viability of the Group, three separate severe but plausible scenarios were modeled taking account of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group.\n\nThe scenarios were designed to re/flect a material reduction in growth, the impact of a potential one-off expense and a scenario where both overlap.\n\n## Viability Assessment: Period\n\nThe Board has reviewed the length of time to be covered by the Viability Statement, particularly given its primary purpose of providing investors with a view of /financial viability that goes beyond the period of the Going Concern Statement.\n\nUsing the Group Strategic Plan (the 'Plan'), which is prepared annually on a bottom-up basis and is approved by the Board, the viability of the Group has been assessed over a three-year period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2024 inclusive.\n\nThe Board believes that a three-year viability statement is appropriate for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 It aligns with our normal strategic planning time horizon;\n- \u00b7 Construction activity, and therefore demand for the Group's products, is inherently cyclical as it is in/fluenced by global and national economies;\n- \u00b7 It aligns with our long-term management incentives, such as the deferred element of the Annual Performance-related Incentive Plan; and\n- \u00b7 Uncertainty increases inherently with expanding time horizons potentially impacting the large number of external variables that need to be factored.\n\nOverall, a three-year period is deemed to achieve a suitable balance between long and short-term in/fluence.\n\n## Scenario Modelled\n\n## Relevant Principal Risks\n\n## Scenario 1: Recessionary environment\n\nEconomic slowdown/recession resulting in revenue reductions and margin compression\n\n## Scenario 2: One-Off Expense\n\nImpact of a potential large event, /fine and/or penalty\n\n## Scenario 3: Combination (1 and 2)\n\nCombination of prior scenarios overlapping or occurring simultaneously\n\n- \u00b7 Industry Cyclicality and Economic Conditions\n- \u00b7 Portfolio Management\n- \u00b7 Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 Pandemic\n- \u00b7 Laws, Regulations and Business Conduct\n- \u00b7 Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- \u00b7 Information Technology and/or Cyber Security\n- \u00b7 Combination of relevant risks from prior scenarios\n\n## Viability Assessment: Approach\n\nThe viability of the Group is assessed against the Plan and projections considering the Group's cash /flows, committed funding and liquidity positions, forecast future funding requirements, other key /financial ratios, including those relevant to maintaining the Group's investment grade credit ratings and the Group's 2025 climate targets.\n\nIn conducting the viability assessment, the Board has considered our strong balance sheet and cash /flow generation, our dynamic capital allocation model underpinned by comprehensive portfolio reviews and capital appraisals, and our philosophy of continuous improvement.\n\nAppropriate stress testing of certain key performance, solvency and liquidity assumptions, such as EBITDA (as de/fined)* margins and Net Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)*, underlying the Plan has been conducted taking account of the principal risks and uncertainties faced and possible severe but plausible combinations of those risks and uncertainties. For more detail on our principal risks and uncertainties, how they could impact the Group and how the Group manages these risks, see pages 116 to 121 of the Governance report.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the Board acknowledges that the potential severity, complexity and velocity of the risks assessed may change, based on their assessment of viability as described, the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the aforementioned three-year period to 31 December 2024.",

Underlying good operating performance offset the impacts of higher input costs and inclement weather. Likefor-like sales in 2021 increased by 6% against 2020, due to positive volume growth and pricing progression.\n\nEurope Materials saw like-for-like sales 11% ahead of 2020 re/flecting good volume growth, and pricing progress against a prior year comparative which was heavily impacted by pandemic restrictions. Positive pricing actions and strong /fixed cost control offset cost in/flation headwinds.\n\nBuilding Products delivered like-for-like sales 5% ahead of 2020 driven by strong demand for residential construction and a moderate recovery in the non-residential sector.\n\nEBITDA (as de/fined)* of $5.35 billion was 16% ahead (2020: $4.6 billion) re/flecting the bene/fits of our integrated solutions strategy with strong demand growth and continued commercial discipline. Pro/fit after tax was signi/ficantly ahead of 2020 at $2.6 billion (2020: $1.2 billion) driven by a strong trading performance and the non-recurrence of non-cash impairment charges and one-off restructuring costs in the prior year.\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies by the end of 2021. However, during 2021 the US Dollar weakened against most major currencies resulting in the average US Dollar/Euro rate weakening from 0.8771 in 2020\n\n- 1.

Net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources 2021 compared with 2020\n\nThe comments that follow refer to the major components of the Group's cash /flows for 2021 and 2020 as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 144.\n\nDespite signi/ficantly increased trading activity compared to 2020, the Group remained focused on cash management. Management delivered a net working capital out/flow of $228 million (2020: $196 million in/flow) and the Group's operating cash /flow increased to $4.2 billion (2020: $3.9 billion).\n\nWorking capital was $2.5 billion at year end (2020: $2.4 billion) representing 8.0% of sales (2020: 8.7%). CRH believes that its current working capital is suf/ficient for the Group's present requirements.\n\nFocused investment in property, plant and equipment in markets and businesses with increased demand and ef/ficiency requirements, resulted in higher cash out/flows of $1.6 billion (2020: $1.0 billion), with spend in 2021 representing 110% of depreciation on owned assets (2020: 74%).\n\nRe/flective of the ongoing strategy of active portfolio management, the Group invested $1.5 billion in bolt-on acquisitions (2020: $0.4 billion) which was partly /financed by divestment and disposal proceeds 1 of $0.5 billion (2020: $0.3 billion).\n\nRe/flecting our strong /financial position and commitment to returning cash to shareholders, the Group continued its share buyback programme in 2021 repurchasing 17.8 million (2020: 6.0 million) ordinary shares for a total consideration of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.2 billion). The Group announced a further $0.3 billion tranche of the ongoing share buyback programme on 24 December 2021 to be completed no later than 30 March 2022.\n\nThese buybacks, together with cash dividend payments of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.7 billion), re/flect the Group's continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nYear end interest-bearing loans and borrowings were $10.5 billion (2020: $12.2 billion) and year-end net debt of $6.3 billion ($5.9 billion) re/flects strong in/flows from operations and an increase in disciplined capital expenditure and value-focused investments. The Group is in a good /financial position. It is well funded and EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover is 17.2x (2020: 11.9x).\n\nThe Group ended 2021 with total liquidity of $9.8 billion, comprising $5.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand and $4.0 billion of undrawn committed facilities which are available until 2026. At year end, the Group had suf/ficient cash balances to meet all maturing debt obligations (including leases) for the next /five years and the weighted average maturity of the remaining term debt was 11.9 years.",

The purpose of these programmes is to provide short-term liquidity at attractive terms.\n\nContractual obligations and Off-Balance Sheet arrangements are disclosed on page 244 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nJim Mintern Finance Director\n\n## Development Review\n\n## 2021\n\nThe Group invested $1.5 billion in 20 bolt-on acquisitions in 2021 (including deferred and contingent consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions).\n\nThe largest of these in 2021 was the acquisition of Angel Brother Enterprises, an asphalt paving and infrastructure solutions business in Texas. In addition, the Americas Materials Division completed a further seven bolt-on acquisitions across the US and Canada for a total spend of $0.7 billion.\n\nThe Building Products Division completed eight acquisitions amounting to a total spend of c. $0.8 billion including NPP a water and energy infrastructure solutions business in the eastern region of the US. This acquisition will further enhance our end-to-end solutions offering to our customers.\n\nThe Europe Materials Division completed four acquisitions, with a total spend of c. $17 million. The Group also paid $33 million of deferred and contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions.\n\nOn the divestment front, the Group completed 11 transactions and realised total business and asset disposal cash proceeds of $0.5 billion, inclusive of $0.1 billion relating to the receipt of deferred proceeds from prior year divestments, the majority of which related to the divestment of the Group's equity interest in My Home Industries (MHIL), in India. The sale of the Brazil cement operations by the Americas Materials Division represented the largest divestment during the year, with a further 10 other divestments completed across the Group.\n\n## 2020\n\nThe Americas Materials Division completed seven bolt-on acquisitions across the US and Canada for a total spend of $163 million. The Building Products Division completed six bolton acquisitions amounting to a total spend of c. $180 million including the acquisition of Martin Enterprises. Europe Materials completed four acquisitions, with a total spend of c. $8 million for the Division. The Group also paid $54 million of deferred and contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions.\n\nOn the divestment front, the Group completed 12 transactions and realised total business and asset disposal cash proceeds of $307 million, inclusive of $123 million relating to the receipt of deferred proceeds from prior year divestments. The sale of precast concrete production assets located in Spokane, Washington represented the largest divestment in 2020 and was completed by our Building Products Division. The divestment of the building materials business in La R\u00e9union was the second largest divestment, completed by our Europe Materials Division, with 10 other divestments completed across the Divisions. In addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of $128 million from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets. Cash proceeds of $123 million were received relating to prior year divestments, of which $95 million related to the divestment of the Group's equity interest in MHIL.\n\nIn addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of $0.1 billion from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets.",

        "page_content": "## Americas Materials\n\nOur Americas Materials Division comprises vertically integrated businesses which produce and supply building materials and services for use in construction projects throughout the US and Canada.\n\n## What we do\n\nCRH's Americas Materials Division is the largest building materials business in North America, serving customers in attractive local construction markets across 46 US states and six Canadian provinces.\n\nOur businesses utilise an extensive network of reserve backed quarry locations, to produce and supply a range of materials including cement, aggregates, readymixed concrete and asphalt. These materials are used widely in a variety of construction projects including public infrastructure, homes and commercial buildings.\n\nOver several decades CRH has built up market leading positions throughout North America in aggregates and readymixed concrete while currently being the largest producer of asphalt. CRH is a leading producer of cement in North America. CRH is also the leading supplier of products for road construction and repair and maintenance in the US. Approximately 50% of the Division's business relates to the construction of infrastructure, a signi/ficant proportion of which is awarded by public tender for federal, provincial, state and local government authority road and infrastructure projects.\n\nThrough innovation, recycling, and the use of alternative materials, many of our materials have enhanced sustainability attributes\n\nwhich help address the changing needs of construction, including the need for a more resilient and sustainable built environment.\n\n## How we create value\n\nCRH's vertically integrated business model enables us to create value throughout the supply chain. Materials produced by our aggregates and cement businesses can be supplied to our downstream materials businesses for use in products such as readymixed concrete and asphalt.\n\nBy integrating our operations we can also provide customers with more complete end-to-end solutions which bundle different materials, value-added products and services to provide customers with a value enhancing one-stop-shop. This helps to reduce logistical complexity and save the customer time and money, while allowing CRH to deepen its relationships and increase the spend from each customer.\n\nThis approach is fundamental to our development strategy and sets CRH apart within its industry.\n\nIn recent years we have grown our presence in higher growth southern states in the US to increase CRH's exposure to the favourable demand fundamentals of higher population growth and positive migration trends, which underpin good demand for our materials.\n\n## Our integrated materials, products and services\n\nWhere we are located\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reserves and Resources\n\nReserves comprise mineral deposits found within our extensive network of quarry locations in attractive local markets throughout North America. For additional information on the Group's mineral reserves and resources see page 226.\n\n## Cement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCement is the primary binding agent in the production of concrete products for the construction industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Readymixed Concrete\n\nReadymixed concrete is a highly versatile building material comprised of aggregates bound together with cement and water.\n\n## Aggregates\n\nAggregates refers to crushed stone, produced from naturally occurring mineral deposits. Our businesses process these materials for sale to customers.\n\n## Asphalt\n\nAsphalt is an aggregates based product, used primarily in road surfacing and other transport infrastructure including airport runways.\n\n## Paving & Construction Services\n\nCRH is the leading supplier of product for road construction and repair/maintenance demand in North America. Annually, our crews complete approximately $4.7 billion in paving and construction projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe largely unconsolidated US building materials market presents further opportunities for value creation by allowing us to identify businesses that can be integrated ef/ficiently into our existing network.\n\n## How we are structured\n\nCRH combines the /flexibility, speed, close customer relationships and in-depth market knowledge of local businesses with the strength, shared expertise and operational excellence of a national network. This focus on operational excellence and local knowledge is supported by a strong strategic centre which enables CRH to leverage talent, procurement synergies and ef/ficiencies across the Division.\n\nDuring 2021 our Americas Materials Division was re-organised from three to four geographical regions (Great Lakes, Northeast, South and West). We also have a cement platform which spans North America. The Great Lakes division comprises operations in seven states and two Canadian provinces, the Northeast division comprises operations in 11 states, the South division operates across 11 states, while the West division has operations in 19 states. The cement platform operates across 20 states and six Canadian provinces. In total, the Division has a network of 1,605 operating locations and employs approximately 28,300 people.",

Like-for-like readymixed concrete volumes were higher than 2019 levels as growth in our core Florida and Texas markets continued. Commercial and operational excellence across all product lines supported strong operating pro/fit performance.\n\nThe West division increased total sales by 3% by executing on strong backlogs with support from favourable weather in comparison to the /first half of 2019. Good incremental volumes coupled with strong price discipline and cost control resulted in operating pro/fit improvements.\n\n## Cement\n\nOur cement business delivered operating pro/fit growth in 2020, driven primarily by strong price realisation, performance improvement initiatives and cost saving measures. Sales volumes in the US operations were 2% ahead of 2019 on a total and like-for-like basis as strong demand in the west more than offset COVID-19 related impacts in other regions. Volumes in Canada were behind 2019 due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions, particularly during the /first half of the year.\n\nCement consumption in Southeast Brazil increased in 2020 enabling CRH to achieve volume growth combined with increased prices which resulted in operating pro/fit improvement.\n\nAmericas Materials generated EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $2.4 billion, 10% ahead of 2019 and operating pro/fit of $1.6 billion, 15% ahead of 2019 despite lower sales which were 3% behind. COVID-19 restrictions negatively impacted sales volumes in the second quarter, particularly in the Northeast and Great Lakes divisions, with sales in the South division impacted by project delays in key states. Solid price progression, operational ef/ficiencies, focused cost containment and lower energy costs drove margin expansion across all regions and product lines. Strong demand in the central and western parts of the US resulted in like-for-like sales growth across all lines of business in the West region.\n\nOverall economic and construction activity across our markets was impacted by the global pandemic; however, government stimulus to help support the US economy was implemented, while infrastructure investment was underpinned by a one-year extension of the US FAST Act.\n\nDuring 2020 Americas Materials completed seven acquisitions in the US and Canada including aggregates, asphalt, readymixed concrete, paving and construction operations at a total cost of $163 million. These acquisitions in addition to several mineral reserve purchases in the US will continue to support future growth in key markets.\n\n## Materials\n\nOn a like-for-like basis, aggregates volumes were 2% lower but margins improved as prices were 4% higher compared to 2019. Volumes in the Northeast and Great Lakes divisions were predominantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter of the year while the South division experienced lower demand primarily due to unfavourable weather in the /first half of the year. Solid underlying business activity in the West division generated sales growth during the year. Prices were favourable across all divisions with the strongest contributions from the Northeast and South divisions.\n\nAsphalt volumes were 6% lower on a like-for-like basis due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in the Northeast and Great Lakes divisions and slower project bidding in key states in the South. Volumes in the West division were ahead of 2019 with a strong order book of business supported by more favourable weather. Asphalt margins improved, bene/fiting from good commercial management, lower input costs, operational ef/ficiencies and strong cost control.\n\nReadymixed concrete volumes were 4% behind 2019 levels on both a total and like-for-like basis as higher volumes in the South division during the second half of the year did not fully offset lower volumes in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West. Strong commercial discipline delivered total and like-for-like prices up 6%, more than offsetting lower sales volumes, resulting in improved margins.\n\nPaving and construction revenues were 6% behind 2019 levels on a total and like-for-like basis. COVID-19 impacted the Northeast and Great Lakes divisions through government mandated restrictions, while the South experienced delayed bidding on projects in key markets due to uncertainty in state and local funding sources. The West division experienced signi/ficant growth in revenues driven by strong demand in the Central West and Mountain West regions. Overall construction margins /finished ahead of 2019.\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nLike-for-like sales for the Northeast division were 8% lower than 2019 as COVID-19 restrictions impacted volumes across the business. Operating pro/fit for the Northeast division was negatively impacted by lower volumes, partly offset by strong prices and lower input costs.\n\nGreat Lakes sales were 8% behind 2019, as a result of lower volumes due to rising prices, which was offset by lower input costs and savings initiatives.",

Operating pro/fit was 10% ahead of 2020. Solid volume and pricing progression across all lines of business coupled with operating ef/ficiencies offset the in/flationary input cost environment. Like-for-like sales were 6% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 7%.\n\nUS construction activity recovered in 2021 with increased residential demand along with a moderate recovery in non-residential markets. Infrastructure funding levels were maintained at similar levels to prior year ahead of the recently approved multi-year federal infrastructure package. Canada experienced continued strong demand within its residential sector.\n\nDuring 2021 Americas Materials completed eight acquisitions in the US and Canada for a total spend of $0.7 billion, the largest of which was the acquisition of Angel Brothers Enterprises, an asphalt paving and infrastructure solutions business in Texas. The divestment of the Brazil cement operations was completed in the /first half of 2021 for consideration of $0.2 billion.\n\n## Materials\n\nAggregates volumes were 3% ahead of 2020 on a like-for-like basis driven by good demand in our Northeast, Great Lakes and West divisions. The South division was negatively impacted by adverse weather particularly in the /first half of 2021. Our selling prices improved 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, resulting in good margin expansion overall.\n\nReadymixed concrete volumes were 4% ahead on a total and like-for-like basis as residential demand remained strong; good commercial discipline delivered price increases of 5%.\n\nPaving and construction revenues were 7% ahead of 2020, and 1% behind on a like-for-like basis, due to unfavourable weather in the South and a slower start to the season in both Great Lakes and Northeast. Revenues were higher in the West driven by an early start to the construction season and solid underlying demand. Construction margins were ahead of 2020.\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nSales in the Northeast were ahead of 2020 as volumes improved following a prior year which was impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Higher volumes and pricing across all lines of business were offset by higher input costs resulting in operating pro/fit in line with 2020.\n\nGreat Lakes sales were ahead of 2020 driven by solid residential and commercial demand. Operating pro/fit growth was led by good commercial and operational performance offsetting higher input costs.\n\nSouth sales were ahead of 2020 driven primarily by positive pricing and continued growth in readymixed concrete volumes in our Florida and Texas markets. Operating pro/fit marginally declined as an improved commercial and operational performance was offset by the impacts of unfavourable weather and higher input costs.\n\nLike-for-like asphalt volumes were 2% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like average prices also increased. Good market conditions in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West offset unfavourable weather conditions in the South.\n\nSales in the West were well ahead of 2020, driven by robust demand and positive pricing across all lines of business. Operating pro/fit improved as higher volumes and prices coupled with cost saving initiatives offset higher input costs.\n\n## Cement\n\nOur cement business delivered a strong performance driven by a growth in sales which were 12% and 11% ahead of prior year on a total and like-for-like basis respectively. Operating pro/fit was ahead of 2020 driven by a 5% increase in volume, strong price realisation and cost saving measures which offset increases in input costs. Both US and Canada volumes were ahead of 2020 due to good market demand and strong backlog execution.",

Strong cost control, lower fuel costs and positive pricing all contributed to operating pro/fit /finishing strongly ahead of 2019 levels. Romania, in particular, experienced a very positive trading performance in 2020 with sales and operating pro/fit both signi/ficantly ahead of 2019, as a continuation of infrastructure projects, the positive impact of local and national elections and increased residential repair works contributed to growing cement demand with pricing above 2019 levels. Overall, with minimal COVID-19 restrictions, positive underlying trading conditions combined with business improvement initiatives, Europe East saw a continuation of growth in sales and operating pro/fit performance in 2020.\n\n## Asia\n\nDomestic demand for cement in the Philippines was severely impacted between mid-March and May as COVID-19 restrictions resulted in plant shutdowns. Despite this challenging backdrop and lower pricing, operating pro/fit /finished well ahead of 2019 due to cost savings, performance improvement initiatives and improved volumes in the second half of the year.\n\nCRH's operations include a 26% stake in Yatai Building Materials in China where, despite a severe COVID-19 impact in the /first quarter, full year cement volumes ended ahead of 2019. Pricing remained challenging in the region which, in addition to the non-cash impairment charge resulted in operating pro/fit below 2019 levels.\n\nEurope Materials experienced a challenging year as the recovery in the second half of the year could not fully mitigate the signi/ficant impact of COVID-19 related restrictions in the second quarter. Overall sales, EBITDA (as de/fined)* and operating performance /finished below 2019 levels as strong performances in our Eastern European businesses were offset by a more challenging backdrop in a number of countries across Western Europe. A combination of volume growth, progress in pricing, good cost control and performance improvement initiatives drove some recovery in the second half of the year.\n\nArising from the Group's impairment testing process and as a result of the combined economic impacts of COVID-19 and Brexit, total non-cash impairment charges of $0.8 billion were recognised in 2020. Europe Materials recorded impairment charges of $0.7 billion in its operating pro/fit, primarily related to its UK business. A further $0.15 billion impairment charge was recorded on the Group's associate investment in China.\n\n## UK & Ireland\n\nIn our UK & Ireland businesses, strict COVID-19 restrictions resulted in widespread plant shutdowns during the second quarter which signi/ficantly impacted volumes during this period. Trading recovered as the year progressed, with strong cement volumes and increased paving activity in the second half of the year supporting improved aggregates and asphalt volumes; however, readymixed concrete volumes were slower to recover due to market uncertainty. Operating pro/fit, impacted by the lower volumes, impairment charges and restructuring costs, /finished below 2019 levels.\n\n## Europe North\n\nEurope North (Finland, Germany and Switzerland) businesses did not experience signi/ficant COVID-19 related shutdowns and overall sales in Europe North ended ahead of 2019 levels supported by some larger aggregates projects. However, operating pro/fit fell below 2019 due to a less favourable product mix and higher input and restructuring costs. Despite a good level of pricing progress and cost saving initiatives they were not enough to offset the lower cement, lime and readymixed concrete volumes and increased costs.\n\n## Europe West\n\nDespite a good recovery in the second half of the year and a robust performance throughout the year in our Precast businesses, Europe West (France, Benelux, Denmark and Spain) sales ended the year down on 2019 as trading was signi/ficantly impacted by COVID-19 restrictions in the /first half of the year. Volumes in France were severely impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions in the second quarter of 2020 as cement, aggregates and readymixed concrete volumes were signi/ficantly below 2019 levels. Price increases and cost saving actions were implemented to improve trading performance, but overall operating pro/fit ended the year below 2019.",

Europe Materials generated sales of $10.6 billion and EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $1.4 billion, 16% and 34% ahead of prior year respectively with an operating pro/fit of $0.8 billion. Like-for-like sales were 11% ahead of 2020, while EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 22%. Energy market volatility resulted in increased cost in/flation but positive pricing actions and a continued focus on cost savings and performance initiatives delivered margin expansion.\n\n## UK & Ireland\n\nUK & Ireland sales were well ahead of prior year re/flecting an improved trading environment following signi/ficant COVID-19 disruption in 2020. Operating pro/fit was also signi/ficantly ahead due to improved volumes across all product lines but also assisted by cost saving and restructuring initiatives which commenced in 2020. Signi/ficant pricing actions were undertaken in the second half of the year to offset input cost in/flation, which also contributed to the strong 2021 performance.\n\n## Europe North\n\nDespite prolonged winter weather, demand in Europe North (Finland, Germany and Switzerland) improved as the year progressed. Cement and lime volumes were ahead of prior year which, combined with strong price increases, resulted in increased sales. Europe North experienced signi/ficant energy cost in/flation, particularly in the second half, but additional pricing actions and a continued focus on cost saving initiatives resulted in operating pro/fit well ahead of 2020 levels.\n\n## Current Year 2021\n\n| Results                        |       | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change        | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   | Analysis of change   |\n|--------------------------------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| $ million                      | 2020  | Exchange             | Acquisitions         | Divestments          | Impairment 1 / One-offs 2 | Organic              | 2021                 | % change             |\n| Sales revenue                  | 9,141 | +403                 | +8                   | -57                  | -                         | +1,086               | 10,581               | 16%                  |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*          | 1,055 | +34                  | -                    | -5                   | +83                       | +243                 | 1,410                | 34%                  |\n| Operating (loss)/pro/fit       | -190  | +7                   | -                    | -2                   | +748                      | +251                 | 814                  | 528%                 |\n| EBITDA (as de/fined)*/sales    | 11.5% |                      |                      |                      |                           |                      | 13.3%                |                      |\n| Operating (loss)/pro/fit/sales | -2.1% |                      |                      |                      |                           |                      | 7.7%                 |                      |\n\n1 Includes $0.7 billion 2020 impairment charge\n\n\u00b2One-offs primarily due to 2020 COVID-19 related restructuring costs\n\n## Europe West\n\n## Asia\n\nEurope West (France, Benelux, Denmark and Spain) delivered a good trading performance with higher cement volumes combined with continued pricing progress across all markets. France in particular experienced a strong recovery as a result of improved underlying trading conditions which, together with signi/ficant cost saving actions implemented in 2020, have resulted in like-for-like operating pro/fit well ahead of 2020. Our precast operations also delivered sales and operating pro/fit ahead of 2020 despite experiencing signi/ficant raw material and energy cost in/flation. Overall, continued cost saving actions and commercial initiatives resulted in operating pro/fit well ahead of prior year.\n\n## Europe East\n\nEurope East (Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Serbia) experienced mild weather in the fourth quarter and robust demand throughout the year, which resulted in cement volumes ahead of 2020 and continued growth in downstream products. Operating pro/fit in Poland was signi/ficantly ahead of prior year due to good volume and price increases combined with strong cost control. Despite rising energy cost in/flation in the second half of the year, overall operating pro/fit was well ahead of 2020 with good cost control and strong price increases across all markets.\n\nSales and operating pro/fit in the Philippines were signi/ficantly ahead of 2020, which was severely impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Cement volumes were well ahead in 2021 as the market recovered. Despite a competitive pricing environment and rising input costs, operational improvements and cost containment initiatives resulted in operating pro/fit ahead of 2020.\n\nCRH's operations include a 26% stake in Yatai Building Materials in China, where strong price increases offset lower volumes to deliver signi/ficantly improved operating pro/fit in 2021.",

However, sales of key products to the communications sector and electric utilities proved to be resilient as demand for IT infrastructure was strong. The business recorded increased like-for-like operating pro/fit due to continued performance improvement measures and focused cost control. Europe recorded lower like-for-like sales in 2020 because of COVID-19 restrictions in key markets, particularly the UK. In Australia, like-for-like sales were below 2019 due to continued challenges in the telecom sector in the country.\n\n## Construction Accessories\n\nLike-for-like sales were lower than 2019 because of COVID-19 shutdowns affecting project activity particularly in the /first half. In Europe, sales were worst affected in Western Europe, with Central and Eastern European markets experiencing more resilient demand. Sales in Australia bene/fited from several large infrastructure projects, while North America recorded lower like-for-like sales due to increased competition, further compounded by COVID-19. Operating pro/fit was lower in 2020, as the unfavourable volume impact was only partly offset by overhead cost savings and bene/fits from ongoing procurement, commercial and operational initiatives.\n\nIn 2020, Building Products recorded like-for-like sales growth of 4% due to strong residential RMI demand, especially in North America, which more than offset the effect of a more subdued non-residential sector. Ongoing business improvement initiatives and COVID-19 mitigating actions delivered higher margins through production ef/ficiencies, commercial excellence, procurement savings and overhead cost control. On a like-for-like basis EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 8% and operating pro/fit by 11%, as a result of the improved sales growth and continued progress with cost reductions.\n\nFollowing a strong start to the year, economic conditions in North America and Europe were signi/ficantly impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic particularly affected non-residential construction activity while the residential sector was bolstered by increased home improvement activity.\n\nActivity levels in North America were impacted by COVID-19 restrictions from the /first quarter of 2020, mostly affecting the West Coast, Northeastern US, and Canada. In Europe, construction markets showed resilience in Central and Eastern European countries, while much of Western Europe, notably the UK, France, and Belgium, saw more severe volume impacts from lockdown restrictions, particularly in the /first half of the year.\n\nTwo divestments and six bolt-on acquisitions were completed in 2020. Building Products' largest acquisitions were two manufacturers of underground enclosures in Tennessee and Texas, both within Infrastructure Products.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America delivered strong sales growth in 2020, re/flecting positive market demand across all product groups and regions. With North America seeing heightened residential RMI demand, sales through both our retail and professional channels increased. The businesses delivered signi/ficant margin expansion from the continued focus on operational excellence, as well as modest price growth and tight overhead cost control. Sales in our European businesses were ahead mainly due to volume growth in Germany and Poland.\n\n## Building Envelope\n\nBuilding Envelope's sales were lower than 2019, with COVID-19 restrictions unfavourably impacting volumes across key products and geographies, particularly at C.R. Laurence. Volumes were impacted by the softening of non-residential markets, with a number of projects being delayed or cancelled, while the selling price environment remained competitive. As restrictions eased, the rate of sales decline lessened over the course of the second half. Operating pro/fit was behind 2019 as a result of lower volumes, partly offset by cost management initiatives.",

        "page_content": "Building Products delivered sales growth of 11% due to strong demand for residential construction, particularly in North America, along with a good recovery in certain parts of the non-residential sector. Ongoing business improvement initiatives delivered higher margins through production ef/ficiencies, good commercial management, procurement savings and overhead cost control. EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 16% while operating pro/fit was 20% ahead. Like-for-like sales were 5% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like EBITDA (as de/fined)* increased by 8%.\n\nDuring 2021 Building Products completed eight bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in the US and across all product platforms, at a total spend of $0.8 billion. The largest acquisition was Infrastructure Products' purchase of NPP, a water, energy and infrastructure solutions business.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America delivered strong sales growth in 2021, re/flecting positive market demand and robust residential RMI activity. Operating pro/fit increased due to improved pricing and volume growth, a continued focus on operational improvements and strong overhead cost control.

Operating pro/fit was ahead of prior year driven by improved pricing, operational excellence initiatives and other cost savings, partly offset by input cost in/flation.\n\n## Infrastructure Products\n\nInfrastructure Products experienced strong sales growth in 2021. Sales to the communications and utilities sectors were resilient and demand for IT infrastructure was strong. The business delivered increased operating pro/fit due to continued performance improvement measures and good cost control. Total sales and operating pro/fit also bene/fited from the acquisition of NPP in the third quarter. Our European businesses contributed to the strong sales growth and operating pro/fit was ahead. Our Australian business experienced lower sales due to COVID-19 restrictions which hindered production and limited deliveries.\n\nLike-for-like sales in Construction Accessories were ahead of 2020 driven by strong volumes as the business bene/fited from higher residential demand and project activity. Sales growth was primarily led by North America, the UK and France. Increased sales and continued cost saving initiatives more than offset input cost in/flation, resulting in like-for-like operating pro/fit ahead of prior year.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Report\n\nThe Corporate Governance Report contains details of CRH's governance structures and highlights areas of focus for the Board over the last year. In keeping with prior years, details of CRH's general governance practices are available in the governance appendix on CRH's website, www.crh.com (the 'Governance Appendix') 1 . CRH implemented the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the '2018 Code') and this Report explains how the principles of the 2018 Code have been applied.\n\n## Operation of the Board\n\nFollowing the onset of COVID-19, the Board met virtually for a period of 18 months up to mid-2021. Whilst this worked well, and did not hinder the Board in ful/filling its responsibilities and duties, I am pleased to report that we recommenced in-person meetings with suitable safety protocols in place in the second half of the year. This has enhanced the richness of discussion at Board and Committee meetings, and non-executive Director sessions. It has also helped forge relationships between the four directors appointed since March 2020 and existing Board members, and has led to increased and more in-depth interactions with the senior management team. During the course of 2022, we intend to recommence our twice-yearly site visits to operations in Europe and the US.\n\n## Senior Executive Succession\n\nSenior executive succession planning continued to be an area of focus for the Board and Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee. Details on activity in this area during 2021 are set out on page 71.\n\nThe Board also received regular updates on the bench strength and diversity of the senior management team, together with detailed plans for development generally and by individual role.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nDetailed reports on the areas of focus for the Audit, Nomination & Corporate Governance, Remuneration and Safety, Environment and Social Responsibility (SESR) Committees are included on pages 64 to 109.\n\nThe performance of the Board's Committees was assessed as part of the external Board evaluation process referred to below.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board approved minor changes to the Terms of Reference of the Audit, Nomination & Corporate Governance, Remuneration and SESR Committees. The changes were primarily to align the Terms of Reference with current Board practices and terminology and to ensure they remain aligned with evolving best practice, where relevant. The updated Terms of Reference are available on the CRH website, www.crh.com.\n\nThe primary (premium) listing of CRH plc is on the LSE, with the listing on Euronext Dublin characterised as secondary. For this reason, CRH plc is not subject to the same ongoing listing requirements as would apply to an Irish company with a primary listing on Euronext Dublin. For further information, shareholders should consult their /financial adviser. Further details on the Group's listing arrangements, including its premium listing on the LSE, are set out on page 74.",

        "page_content": "In line with prior years, there was regular and extensive engagement on governance matters during the past year with more than 20 meetings with shareholders representing just over 35% of the issued share capital.\"\n\nRichie Boucher Chairman\n\n## Board Evaluation\n\nDuring 2021, the Board engaged Christopher Saul Associates to undertake an external board performance evaluation. The report presented to the Board (the '2021 Report') concluded that the Board is operating effectively. It is collegiate and well-led, it operates to high standards of professionalism and bene/fits from quality support. The Committees observed work diligently and effectively and are well-integrated into Board processes. The relationship between the Board and management is respectful and constructive. It also contained recommendations to further enhance our effectiveness including in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 Board paper content and circulation;\n- \u00b7 Giving consideration to whether the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee could broaden and deepen its activities, for example, in relation to human capital management without undue overlap with the SESR Committee and separately undertaking a review of the breadth of the SESR Committee's responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7 Enhancing Board interaction further, leveraging on the experience of the non-executive Directors and looking at increasing the regularity of non-executive Director sessions\n\n## 2018 Code - Compliance Statement\n\nThe principles set out in the 2018 Code emphasise the value of good corporate governance to the long-term sustainable success of listed companies. These principles, and the supporting provisions, cover /five broad themes:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. Board Leadership and Corporate Purpose\n- 2. Division of Responsibilities\n- 3. Composition, Succession and Evaluation\n- 4. Audit, Risk and Internal Controls\n- 5. Remuneration\n\nAs demonstrated by the disclosures in this Report and the details of CRH's general governance practices in the Governance Appendix, CRH applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the 2018 Code in 2021, with the exception of the following provision:\n\n- \u00b7 Provision 38: alignment of pension contribution rates with wider workforce - see page 101 for more details.\n\nA copy of the 2018 Code can be obtained from the Financial Reporting Council's website, www.frc.org.uk.\n\nWhilst no particular skill or diversity gaps were identi/fied, the 2021 Report included considerations to take into account to developing Board composition priorities.\n\nThe internal and external board performance evaluation processes are one element in the process for identifying strategic themes for discussion by the Board. The 2021 Report highlighted topics that were currently front of mind for the non-executive Directors. The process used for the evaluation is set out on page 72 in the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee Report.\n\n## External Board Appointments\n\nThe external directorships of each Director are detailed in their biographies on pages 56 to 59.\n\nRichard Fearon and Johan Karlstr\u00f6m sought and received approval to take up additional Board roles during 2021. The Board was satis/fied that these new commitments do not impinge on their non-executive duties on the CRH Board.\n\n## Corporate Purpose\n\nAs reported last year, a project has been underway to more fully articulate CRH's purpose a purpose which captures our aspirations beyond /financial returns, inspires our people and guides our day-to-day operations, our culture, and our strategy.\n\nThe framework used during the project utilised insights from CRH's Values, work on CRH brands, historical documents, focus groups and test panels of employees across the geographies and Divisions of CRH, along with insights from a range of external experts from a number of specialist /fields.\n\nThis work is now complete and will be launched with our employees during 2022.\n\nAs part of the purpose project, our Values have been re/fined, to align and further support the organisation in living our purpose.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for workforce engagement to the SESR Committee. Given the footprint of CRH with c.77,400 employees in 28 countries, we believe this is the best and most effective way of ensuring that the views of employees are understood and are taken into consideration in the Board's decision-making processes. The Board receives regular updates and recommendations from the SESR Committee, the work of which is described in detail on pages 76 to 79.\n\nBoard members also attended a seminar of management from across the Group held during the year with appropriate social restrictions and safety protocols, which focused on key issues facing the Group, including, sustainability challenges and opportunities, the work of exploration groups made up of high potential talented employees who were focused on horizon scanning in relation to the future of the construction industry, the work ongoing to embed customer perspectives in our approach to business and the project to articulate CRH's purpose referred to above.\n\nIn line with prior years, there was regular and extensive engagement on governance matters during the past year with more than 20 meetings with shareholders representing just over 35% of the issued share capital. Typically the meetings covered topics such as the safety of our employees, particularly in the context of COVID-19, Board renewal priorities, executive succession planning, strategy, capital allocation, the oversight of the Board in relation to business improvement initiatives, the areas of focus for the Board in relation to sustainability and remuneration arrangements.

I am pleased to report that c.60% of the shareholders contacted provided us with their considered perspectives on the Remuneration Committee's proposals. Full details of the consultation process and the /final remuneration policy proposals are set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 97.\n\nFollowing engagement with investor groups, during the year we undertook a review of climate change lobbying practices to ensure there is an alignment between those practices and the expectations of the Board and our stakeholders. Further detail is set out on page 79 in the SESR Committee Report. We also published the CRH Group Tax Strategy, which sets out the tax objectives, strategy and governance framework of the Group due to the increasing importance for tax transparency across a number of different stakeholders including Governments, sustainability analysts and investors.\n\nThe full range of ways in which we engage with our stakeholders are set out on page 27, which also includes a summary of each stakeholder's main areas of interest and the outcomes of the various engagement processes in 2021.\n\n## Litigation and Compliance\n\nThe Group General Counsel regularly updates the Board on relevant legal and compliance matters and provides reports on any material matters that arise requiring Board decisions or detailed consideration.\n\n## Dematerialisation of Share Certi/ficates\n\nUnder the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (CSDR), there is a requirement for all shares in Irish issuers to be held in book-entry form. The period by which this transition must happen is between January 2023 and January 2025. Book-entry form means an electronic record of ownership such as an entry in an electronic register, without any further or other document such as a share certi/ficate. The Irish market is intending to dispense with share certi/ficates with effect from 1 January 2023. Therefore, from that date all CRH share certi/ficates in issue will be cancelled. However, this will be the only change as these holdings are currently recorded in electronic form on the CRH register of members.\n\nThe removal of share certi/ficates will bring bene/fits to shareholders by reducing the paperwork associated with share transactions such as sales or share transfers and by removing the need for expensive insurance cover in the event that share certi/ficates have been lost or mislaid. Industry participants, such as brokers and registrars, are currently updating their systems to ensure there is no impact on shareholders who currently hold share certi/ficates.\n\nWe understand that the Irish government is planning to introduce legislation to update Irish company law in a way that will override references in the Articles of Association of all Irish issuers to share certi/ficates. Once this legislation is in place, we will seek shareholder approval to align the Articles of Association with the new legislation.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nTable 6 on page 72 provides a summary of competencies, important to the long-term success of the Group, that each Director seeking re-election at the 2022 AGM brings to the Board.\n\nI have evaluated the performance of each Director and am satis/fied that each Director is committed to their role, provides constructive challenge and devotes suf/ficient time and energy to contribute effectively to the performance of the Board.\n\nI strongly recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the re-appointment of each Director going forward for re-election at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe CRH Board and its Committees continued to perform effectively in the past year and I very much appreciate the individual and collective efforts of my executive and non-executive colleagues. I am satis/fied that we have made good progress on our key governance priorities in the areas of succession planning, board renewal, more comprehensively articulating CRH's purpose, sustainability and ensuring we understand the views and perspectives of our stakeholders when making decisions. Your Board is also committed to ensuring that CRH continues to be a leader in managing the challenges and opportunities arising from the impact of climate change and to transparently reporting on our progress in this important area.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman 2 March 2022",

The Committee, and indeed the wider Board and management team, take the issue of climate change very seriously and, as we work towards our ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050, we understand the importance of ensuring transparency for all stakeholders on our plans and progress. Further details on the impact of climate change on CRH can be found on pages 28 to 31.\n\nTable 1 on pages 66 and 67 outlines the principal areas that the Committee focused on in 2021.\n\n## Audit Committee Membership\n\nThe Committee currently consists of /five non-executive Directors considered by the Board to be independent. The biographical details of each member are set out on pages 57 to 59. Together, the members of the Committee bring a broad range of relevant experience and expertise from a variety of industries which is vital in supporting effective governance and enabling the Committee to discharge its responsibilities. Richard Fearon, Siobh\u00e1n Talbot and I have been designated by the Board as the Committee's /financial experts and meet the speci/fic requirements for recent and relevant /financial experience, as set out in the 2018 Code.\n\n## Audit Committee Meetings\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee held eight meetings in order to discharge its duties and responsibilities. Meetings of the Committee are generally scheduled around the /financial",

The Board also receives copies of the minutes of all Committee meetings.\n\nThe Finance Director, Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the Group's external auditors, Deloitte, typically attend Committee meetings. Other senior /finance personnel attend Committee meetings to provide updates on certain key areas of the business, as appropriate. As Chairman of the Committee, I am available to all Board members to discuss any audit or risk related issues they may have. I meet with Deloitte and the Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis, in order to discuss any issues which may have arisen.\n\n## External Auditor\n\nDeloitte was appointed as the Group's external auditor with effect from 1 January 2020 following the completion of a competitive tender process in 2018. Richard Muschamp is the Group's lead audit engagement partner.\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nThe Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for the relationship with the external auditor and for monitoring the effectiveness and quality of the external audit process and the independence of the auditor. The Committee's primary means of assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process is by monitoring performance against the agreed audit plan.\n\nThe Committee also considers the experience and knowledge of the external audit team and the results of post-audit interviews with management and the Audit Committee Chairman. These annual procedures are supplemented by periodic formal reviews of the performance of the external auditor.\n\nIn June 2021, the Committee met with Deloitte to agree the 2021 external audit plan. Table 2 on page 68 outlines the key areas identi/fied as being potentially signi/ficant and how these were addressed during the year. The Committee met regularly with Deloitte during 2021 to monitor progress in relation to the 2021 plan. In February 2022, the Committee received and considered a report from Deloitte on its key audit /findings, including the key risks and signi/ficant areas of judgement, prior to making a recommendation to the Board in relation to the approval of this 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nFurther details in relation to the external auditor, including information on how auditor objectivity and independence are maintained, are included in Section 2 of the Governance Appendix.\n\nFollowing consideration of the above processes, the Committee is satis/fied with the services provided by Deloitte to CRH during 2021.\n\n## Non-audit Fees\n\nIn order to ensure auditor independence and objectivity, the Committee has a policy governing the provision of audit and non-audit services by the external auditor. In 2021, Deloitte provided a number of audit services, including Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 attestation 1 . Deloitte was also engaged during 2021 on a limited number of non-audit services mainly in relation to potential divestments, as well as to provide help with local tax compliance, advice on taxation laws and other related matters, assignments which typically involve relatively low fees. The Committee is satis/fied that the external auditors' knowledge of the Group was an important factor in choosing them to provide these services. The Committee\n\nis also satis/fied that the fees paid to Deloitte for non-audit work in 2021, which amounted to $1.8 million and represented less than 9% of the total fees for the year, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 161 (see also Table 3 on page 68). Further details in relation to the Group's policy regarding non-audit fees are set out in Section 2 of the Governance Appendix.\n\n## Internal Audit Effectiveness\n\nIn December 2020, the Committee received and considered the Internal Audit Charter and audit plan for 2021. During the year, the Committee was updated regularly by the Head of Internal Audit on the delivery of the 2021 plan and on the principal /findings from the work of Internal Audit and management's responses thereto.\n\nExternal Quality Assessments of Internal Audit are conducted periodically to ensure that the Internal Audit function continues to work ef/ficiently and effectively and in compliance with good practice standards, with the latest assessment being conducted during 2021 by KPMG. The assessment included interviews with key stakeholders across the Group (including the members of the Committee) and the examination of the information provided to the Committee. The results identi/fied some areas where the effectiveness of the function could continue to be enhanced. A detailed action plan to address the recommendations has been agreed and will be implemented in 2022.\n\n## Audit Committee Effectiveness and Priorities for 2022\n\nDuring 2021, the Board undertook an externally facilitated Board effectiveness review, which assessed our performance as a Committee. I am happy to con/firm that the evaluation concluded that the Committee continues to operate effectively. I would like to thank my fellow Committee members, the management team, Internal Audit and Deloitte for their commitment and input to the work of the Committee during 2021. Looking ahead to 2022, the Committee will continue to focus on the key ongoing areas outlined in Table 1 on pages 66 and 67, and will also continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties (including climate change) on the Group's Consolidated Fnancial Statements.\n\n## Shaun Kelly\n\nChairman of Audit Committee 2 March 2022",

Richard Muschamp has been the Group's lead audit engagement partner since Deloitte's appointment as external auditor. Following an assessment of Deloitte's continued independence, objectivity and performance, and having received con/firmation of their willingness to continue in of/fice, the Committee has recommended to the Board their continuance in of/fice for the 2022 /financial year. Their continuance in of/fice will be subject to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\nWe also considered and approved the remuneration of Deloitte. Further details of the remuneration received by Deloitte in 2021 are set out in note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 161.\n\nWe reviewed the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F and the appropriateness of the Group's accounting principles, practices and policies, including the key estimates, judgements and disclosures made by management, together with the annual and half-year /financial statements, and recommended them to Board for approval.\n\nIn June 2021, we met with Deloitte to agree the 2021 external audit plan. This included robust discussion and challenge with both Deloitte and management on the scope, materiality thresholds and structure of the 2021 external audit plan. Table 2 on page 68 outlines the key areas identi/fied as being potentially signi/ficant and how we addressed these during the year. We met with Deloitte in February 2022 to discuss Deloitte's /findings, observations and recommendations arising from the 2021 external audit.\n\nA particular area of focus for the Committee in its review of the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F was the Group's reporting on climate-related risks, including the impact on the Group's accounting judgements, disclosures and /financial statements, including their alignment with CRH's carbon reduction targets, and its approach with regard to compliance with the recommendations of various regulatory bodies (International Accounting Standards Board, International Audit and Assurance Standards Board, Financial Reporting Council, European Securities and Markets Authority), the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the emerging EU Taxonomy requirements. In conjunction with the SESR Committee, which took a lead role in analysing the TCFD recommendations and EU Taxonomy regulations and the Company's response thereto, the Committee reviewed the climate disclosures including the TCFD disclosures on pages 28 to 31 and agreed that these are appropriate and that the assumptions used in the /financial statements were consistent with these disclosures.\n\nWe considered and discussed with management and Deloitte various accounting and reporting changes that impacted on the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F and/or future /financial periods, including:\n\n- \u00b7  The new SEC mining property reporting requirements effective for the year ended 31 December 2021 (see pages 226 to 231 for more details); and\n- \u00b7  The new requirements under the EU Transparency Directive and European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) Regulation effective for 2021 in relation to the preparation and publication of annual reports in a single, structured, electronic format that are 'machine-readable'\n\nThrough discussions with both management and Deloitte, we reviewed management's impairment testing methodology and processes, including key judgement areas, assumptions and alignment with our 2025 carbon reduction targets, as well as the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements. We found the methodology to be robust and the results of the testing process appropriate. Further details in relation to the impairment outcome for 2021 are outlined in Table 2 on page 68.",

This included discussion on the impact of climate-related risks on the Group's accounting judgements,  disclosures, processes and /financial statements. We also considered an assessment of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. This had regard to risk  management strategies and all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the  Group's business.

In December 2021, the  Committee considered and approved the proposed Internal Audit plan and approach for 2022, together with the Internal  Audit Charter. We also considered the results of an independent external assessment of the Internal Audit function which was conducted  by KPMG during 2021.

We also reviewed and discussed with management the methodology and processes underlying the Viability Statement,  including the alignment with the Group's 2025 carbon reduction targets, as set out on page 35. We found the methodology  and processes to be robust and recommended to the Board that it approve the Viability Statement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Directors'  Compliance  Statements      | We considered the requirements of the Irish Companies Act 2014 in relation to the Directors' Compliance Statement and  received a report from management on the review undertaken during the /financial year of the compliance structures and  arrangements in place to ensure the Company's material compliance with its relevant obligations.

The annual goodwill impairment testing was conducted by management, and papers outlining the methodology and assumptions used in, and the results of, that assessment were presented to the Committee. This included review of key judgement areas and assumptions such as CGU determination, discount rates, growth rates and alignment with the Group's 2025 carbon reduction targets. Following its deliberations, the Committee was satis/fied that the methodology used by management (which was consistent with prior years) and the results of the assessment, together with the disclosures in note 14, were appropriate.\n\nAs outlined in note 14, no impairment charge was recorded in 2021 (2020: $0.4 billion).\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires revenue and expenses to be recognised on uncompleted contracts, with the underlying principle that, once the outcome of a long-term construction contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and expenses associated with that contract should be recognised by reference to the percentage of completion. If it is anticipated that the contract will be onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic bene/fit of the contract), a provision is created.\n\nFollowing discussion with management, recognising that the majority of contracts were completed within one year, the Committee was satis/fied that the recognition of contract revenue (including the associated disclosures) was appropriate for the Group in 2021.\n\n## Percentage of Audit and Non-audit Fees (i)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (i) Following a formal and extensive audit tender process, Deloitte replaced EY as the Group's external auditor with effect from the /financial year commencing 1 January 2020.\n\nTable 3",

Christopher Saul Associates does not have any connection with CRH or individual Directors.\n\nsuccession. Accordingly, diversity, including but not limited to gender and ethnicity, is an integral part of developing short lists of internal and external candidates and is part of the search speci/fication agreed with external agents. In particular, diversity was a core component for the executive and non-executive search processes conducted by or overseen by the Committee in the past 12 months.\n\nThe Committee and the SESR Committee collectively work with management on the Inclusion & Diversity agenda at below Board level across CRH and monitor progress against agreed Group objectives and targets such as the Board's target of having a minimum of 33% of senior leaders being women by 2030.\n\nDetails of Board gender and ethnicity are set out in Table 4 on page 71.\n\nDetails of the current gender balance across the group, including of the senior leadership team and their direct reports is set out on page 18.\n\n## External Board Evaluation\n\nThe Committee recommended to the Board that Christopher Saul Associates 2 be engaged to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees in 2021. Christopher Saul, who led the evaluation, was Senior Partner at Slaughter and May from 2008 to 2016 and has extensive experience as a business leader, board adviser, practitioner in corporate transactions and in governance best practice. The outcome of the evaluation, which involved in-person interviews with each Director and members of the senior management team, reviews of Board papers and observing Board and Committee meetings, is summarised on page 61.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing the independence of Board members and has recommended to the Board that all of the non-executive Directors be deemed to be independent. The Committee also monitors developments in best practice in relation to corporate governance and makes recommendations to the Board in relation to changes and enhancements to current procedures, where appropriate.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee 2 March 2022",

The spread of nationalities of the Directors re/flects the geographical reach of the Group and we consider that the Board as a whole has the appropriate blend of skills, knowledge and experience, from a wide range of industries, regions and backgrounds, necessary to lead the Group. Section 1 of the Governance Appendix on the CRH website (www.crh.com) contains further details on the Board's structures and the Board's policies with regard to the appointment and retirement of Directors.\n\n## Role and Responsibilities\n\nThe Board is responsible for the leadership, oversight, control, development and long-term success of the Group. It is also responsible for instilling the appropriate culture, values and behaviour throughout the organisation. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for consideration and decision. This includes the matters set out in Table 7.\n\nThe Group's strategy, which is regularly reviewed by the Board, and business model are summarised on pages 14 to 17. The Board has delegated some of its responsibilities to Committees of the Board. While responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems has been delegated to the Audit Committee 3 , the Board retains ultimate responsibility for determining the Group's risk appetite and tolerance, and annually considers a report in relation to the monitoring, controlling and reporting of identi/fied risks and uncertainties. In addition, the Board receives regular reports from the Chairman of the Audit Committee in relation to the work of that Committee in the area of risk management. Individual Directors may seek independent professional advice, at the expense of the Company, in the furtherance of their duties as a Director. The Group has a Directors' and Of/ficers' Liability insurance policy in place. Directors are provided with access to all Board and Committee papers in advance of each meeting. If any Director cannot attend a meeting, they can communicate their opinions and comments on the matters to be considered via the Chairman or the relevant Committee Chairman prior to the relevant meeting.\n\n## Attendance at Scheduled Meetings during the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n## Matters Reserved to the Board\n\n- \u00b7 Appointment of Directors\n- \u00b7 Strategic plans for the Group\n- \u00b7 Annual budget\n- \u00b7 Major acquisitions and disposals\n- \u00b7 Signi/ficant capital expenditure\n- \u00b7 Approval of full-year results and the Annual Report and Form 20-F\n- \u00b7 Approval of the interim results\n\n## Independence of Directors\n\nThe Board has determined that each non-executive Director remains independent.\n\n## Chairman\n\nRichie Boucher was appointed Chairman of the Group with effect from 1 January 2020. On his appointment as Chairman, he met the independence criteria set out in the 2018 Code. Although he holds other directorships, the Board has satis/fied itself that these do not adversely impact on his role as Chairman.\n\nTable 8\n\nTable 7\n\n| Name                | Board   | Board    | ADF   | ADF      | Audit   | Audit    | Nomination (i)   | Nomination (i)   | Remuneration   | Remuneration   | SESR (ii)   | SESR (ii)   |\n|---------------------|---------|----------|-------|----------|---------|----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                     | Total   | Attended | Total | Attended | Total   | Attended | Total            | Attended         | Total          | Attended       | Total       | Attended    |\n| R.

In its work in the area of Board renewal and succession planning, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee looks at the following four criteria when considering non-executive Director roles:\n\n- \u00b7 international business experience, particularly in the regions in which the Group operates or into which it intends to expand;\n- \u00b7 skills, knowledge and expertise (including education or professional background) in areas relevant to the operation of the Board;\n- \u00b7 diversity in all aspects, including nationality, gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths; and\n- \u00b7 the need for an appropriately sized Board\n\nDuring the ongoing process of Board renewal, each, or a combination, of these factors can take priority. To date, the Board has not set any policy regarding age. The ages of the Directors range from 50 to 68, which the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee believes is appropriate at the current time.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Board has established /five permanent Committees to assist in the execution of its responsibilities. The current permanent Committees are:\n\n- \u00b7 Acquisitions, Divestments & Finance;\n- \u00b7 Audit;\n- \u00b7 Nomination & Corporate Governance;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility\n\nAd-hoc Committees are formed from time to time to deal with speci/fic matters.\n\n## Substantial Holdings\n\ntraining to our employees. Legal and Compliance provides support on a range of matters including establishing policies and procedures, providing compliance training and communications, providing legal advice on compliance and business issues, monitoring and investigating Hotline calls, competition/antitrust law, and ensuring the Group is informed of any changes to regulation and/or reporting requirements.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct\n\nOur culture as a company is built on our commitment to upholding the CRH Values and in particular, doing what we say and leading with integrity. This means we do the right things in the right way, comply with the law and work responsibly. The foundation of the Legal and Compliance programme is the Code of Business Conduct (CoBC) and supporting policies, which set out our standards of legal, honest and ethical behaviour. The CoBC complies with the applicable code of ethics regulations of the SEC arising from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The CoBC is applicable to all employees of the CRH Group, including the Chief Executive, our Global Leadership Team and senior /financial of/ficers. A refreshed CoBc was launched during 2021.\n\nCRH's Internal Audit function works side-by-side with Legal and Compliance in monitoring compliance with the CoBC and supporting policies, and in providing an integrated approach to assurance. This cross-functional collaboration supports CRH's goal: to ensure CRH leads with integrity.\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\nIn line with our commitment to maintain high ethical business conduct standards, we continue to update and improve awareness and training efforts. All new employees are provided with the CoBC and relevant employees undertake CoBC training and Advanced Compliance Training on a regular basis. Additional training modules are developed for more focused topics and audiences where necessary.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Company had received notification of the interests outlined in the table below in its Ordinary Share capital, which were equal to, or in excess of, 3%.

The report sets out the primary focus areas for the Committee in the areas of safety, climate change and sustainability, Inclusion & Diversity and workforce matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSustainability has been deeply embedded in all aspects of our strategy and business model for many years.\"\n\nRichie Boucher Chairman\n\n## Committee Membership and Operation\n\nThe Committee currently consists of seven non-executive Directors and the Chief Executive. Typically, new Board members join this Committee in order that they can gain an understanding of the important issues as they relate to CRH and its industry. This approach also enables the Board to quickly leverage their expertise in these key matters, and particularly in relation to climate change. The biographical details of each member of the Committee are set out on pages 56 to 59.\n\nThe Committee meets every quarter and provides a detailed report of discussion and recommendations to the Board following the conclusion of each meeting. The Committee's papers and the minutes of its meetings are available to all Board Directors.\n\n## Climate Change and Sustainability\n\nSustainability has been deeply embedded in all aspects of our strategy and business model for many years. We recognise the importance of decarbonisation in addressing the challenges of climate change and believe that our integrated strategy of value-added products and innovative solutions has an important part to play in the delivery of a more resilient built environment and a more sustainable future.\n\nIn 2021, we announced that we expect to achieve our 2030 carbon emissions reduction target by 2025. The Committee has, therefore, worked with management to put in place updated stretching targets for 2030 as part of our stated ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Those updated stretch targets are set out on page 21.",

The updated targets are set out on page 21.\n\nIn the context of the importance of concrete as a sustainable building material, we also considered and discussed CRH's energy usage, including the plans and initiatives in place to reduce CRH's CO 2 emissions.\n\nWe continued to review and consider reports on the outcomes of operational sustainability audits.\n\nWe also worked with the Remuneration Committee in relation to the incorporation of Sustainability and Inclusion & Diversity metrics into the Group's Performance Share Plan (see Table 40 on page 105 for more details).\n\nWe received and discussed with management regular updates covering the Group's safety performance, policies, action plans, and the background, impact and required remediation actions in relation to any serious incidents.\n\nEmployee Engagement: In line with the authority delegated to the Committee by the Board, we undertook a series of employee engagement exercises and considered and reported to the Board on the feedback received from employees.\n\nInclusion & Diversity: We received and considered updates from management on the status of the ongoing work in the area of Inclusion & Diversity.\n\nCorporate Purpose: We continued to monitor and review progress in relation to the ongoing project to more fully de/fine and articulate the Group's corporate purpose (see page 61 for more details).\n\nClimate Lobbying: We undertook a review of CRH's climate-related lobbying practices to ensure that there is alignment between those practices and the expectations of the Board and our stakeholders.\n\nWe considered and approved the Group's 2020 Sustainability Report, which was released in March 2021, and the various non-/financial disclosures included in this Report on pages 20 to 31. We also reviewed and considered the proposed structure and format of the 2021 Sustainability Report, which will be published in March 2022.\n\nWe also considered and discussed with management the work undertaken to ensure CRH's compliance with the new TCFD and EU taxonomy requirements applicable for 2021 (see pages 26 to 31 and 243 for more details).\n\nThe Group continues to review carbon roadmaps in the context of technical, regulatory, environmental and other developments, as carbon reduction is an important near-term component of the Group's carbon neutrality ambition by 2050. In this regard, the Group is active with a broad range of stakeholders such as the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) and others to develop resources and innovations that will ultimately support cement manufacturing transition to a lower carbon production process. For example, CRH is a member of the SBTi's expert working group to develop the necessary resources to help companies producing cement to align with the goals of the Paris agreement.\n\nThere is also signi/ficant participation by the Group in initiatives aimed at further developing the circular economy, supporting and bene/fiting from sustainable growth and climate neutrality. This presents signi/ficant opportunities for CRH, as we focus on producing a new generation of\n\nlow-carbon, sustainable building solutions for the built environment. By considering the full lifecycle of products and innovating to drive more sustainable outcomes - such as using waste materials and alternative fuels and renewable energy in providing products and solutions for our customers' needs - we can both meet changing customer demands and protect the environment.\n\nWhile CRH's continuous improvement processes will continue to deliver improvements for sustainability, new technologies will be required to reach our net zero aim, which do not currently exist in commercial form. To support this, the Board will be putting in place an innovation fund of $250 million to support this work within CRH.\n\nThrough the GCCA, the Group is taking a leading role at industry level in setting the cement and concrete industry roadmap for net zero concrete. Public policy is central to these efforts and there is a need for a comprehensive policy framework to make low-carbon cement manufacturing\n\ninvestable, to stimulate demand for low-carbon products and to create a circular infrastructure and net zero manufacturing environment. The GCCA is actively working in partnership with policymakers, investors, researchers and customers.\n\n## Oversight and Assurance\n\nThe Committee receives reports on the outcomes of operational sustainability audits, which includes reports from Group Sustainability as well as from Internal Audit on any safety and environmental observations when completing an audit programme. In addition, DNV, one of the world's leading certi/fication bodies, reviews management systems, interviews management, engages with external stakeholders and identi/fies opportunities for improvement as part of the independent assurance of the CRH Sustainability Report.",

The targets proposed for the /first cycle of awards in 2022 using these measures were reviewed and recommended by the SESR Committee. Details of the proposed targets are set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 82.\n\n## Employee Welfare and Engagement\n\nIn 2021, the Board and management continued to focus attention on the adherence to health guidelines, and the needs of employees, customers and suppliers in relation to COVID-19 and our organisational health index. The Board is satis/fied that CRH's experience during the pandemic is re/flective of the experience in wider society in the jurisdictions and geographies in which we operate.\n\nThe Committee and the Board receive regular updates in relation to fatalities of employees and colleagues with con/firmed cases of COVID-19 and on cases across the Group.\n\nIn relation to safety generally, the Committee receives regular reports on lagging safety indicators, such as frequency and severity ratios, and on leading indicators, such as high potential learning events, safety audits and safety culture assessments.\n\nWe very much regret that there were four reportable fatalities in 2021 involving one employee, one contractor and two third-parties. The Committee received and considered detailed reports on each incident and discussed with the Divisional Presidents responsible for each business safety training and work processes and safety culture in the operations concerned. The Committee reports the /findings of its reviews to the Board. Learnings from accidents and 'near misses' are shared across the organisation. The Committee advised the Remuneration Committee that it did not consider that there were any issues arising from its safety reviews that would require an override of remuneration incentive outcomes in 2021.\n\nDuring the year management undertook an extensive employee survey. Just under 38,000 employees were invited to participate, with a very strong response rate of 65%. The /findings, which were consistent across the organisation, showed a strong organisation health score. Areas for potential improvement have been identi/fied and action plans have been put in place. However, the Committee and the Board noted that no fundamental or critical issues had been identi/fied.\n\nThe Board also undertook an employee engagement exercise, led by the Committee and supported by the Human Resources team, whereby we engaged with employees from Europe and the US in a number of two-way sessions. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, these sessions were held virtually. We discussed a range of topics under the broad themes of safety & compliance, performance (including remuneration policies) & development and people & culture. The sessions provided valuable insights into the lived experiences, perceptions and opinions of the Group's employees. The consolidated feedback, which was considered by the Committee and shared with the Board, was closely aligned to the outcome of the employee survey referred to above. A majority of the members of the Remuneration Committee was involved in the sessions and, as outlined on page 82, our employees' views of remuneration matters was considered by that Committee.\n\nCommon areas identi/fied in both the employee survey and engagement sessions were that:\n\n- \u00b7 Professional standards and values are homogenously understood and practiced across the Group;\n- \u00b7 Employees feel a strong sense of connection to the Group but would welcome a de/fined organisational purpose (see also the section on corporate purpose on page 61);\n- \u00b7 There is an opportunity to strengthen employees' understanding of the link between their performance and organisational performance;\n- \u00b7 Employees believe that the organisation is making progress on Inclusion & Diversity, and noted many positive steps so far, but understand that this is an area where continued focus must remain\n\nOverall, the Committee and the Board believes the outcome of both exercises provide positive support for its view that there is good alignment between CRH's values, strategy and culture and that this will further bene/fit from the current project to more comprehensively articulate CRH's corporate purpose.\n\nThe Committee also continued to review and consider reports arising from the Group's 'Hotline' facility, including trends by category of hotline reports, the status of investigations into those reports, outcomes and actions taken.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nCRH has a long-established commitment to transparency on sustainability and the Committee monitors regulatory and other requirements in relation to climate-based disclosures. During 2021, we noted further developments in this area, including the establishment of the International Sustainability Standards Board by the IFRS Foundation Trustees, the EU's proposed Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive as well as further development in relation to the Securities and Exchange Commission's potential climaterelated disclosure rules.\n\nIn respect of new requirements for 2021 Reporting, the Committee reviewed reports on work completed in relation to both the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation. The TCFD standards require disclosure on climate-related governance, strategy, risk management as well as metrics and targets. CRH previously used TCFD standards on a voluntary basis, and in line with our commitment to transparency, our disclosures are now consistent with TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures.\n\nEU Taxonomy, which is an EU regulatory classi/fication system that de/fines environmentally sustainable activities by providing 'technical screening criteria' thresholds for activities to be reported as 'sustainable', requires CRH to disclose the percentage of activities that are taxonomy-eligible in 2021.\n\nTCFD and EU Taxonomy related disclosures have been reviewed by the Committee and are set out on pages 28 to 31 and 243 respectively.",

The purpose was to ensure there is an alignment between those practices and the expectations of the Board and our stakeholders. The Group will publish a report on the outcome of this review in conjunction with the publication of the 2021 Sustainability Report. The review did not identify material direct climate-related lobbying or any inconsistencies between our climate positions and those of our main trade associations.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nThe Board and management are committed to building an inclusive and diverse organisation in which talented people of all backgrounds are welcome and can work in an environment which supports them in performing at their best. This is supported by a speci/fic target of having a minimum of 33% of senior leaders being women by 2030. The Committee uses a dashboard to track progress against this target and diversity generally in relation to executive roles.\n\nInclusion & Diversity is also a standing item on SESR Committee agendas, with the Committee receiving regular updates in relation to initiatives to build an inclusive culture in each Division and global function, and progress in the areas of learning and development such as mentorship programmes and I&D modules in training programmes. Following signi/ficant progress in 2021 around 5,000 leaders and managers have participated in I&D awareness training. In addition, a video series designed for all employees has been piloted and modules have been developed for our Frontline Leadership Programme.\n\n## Richie Boucher\n\nChairman of the Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility Committee 2 March 2022",

It is intended that the updated policy will apply for a period of up to three years from that date.\n\nIn developing proposals for the updated policy, the Committee conducted a review of the current policy to ensure it remains /fit-for-purpose, and continues to deliver against its stated purpose to:\n\n- \u00b7 Motivate and reward executives to perform in the long-term interests of the shareholders;\n- \u00b7 Attract and retain executives of the highest calibre;\n- \u00b7 Re/flect the spread of the Group's operations so that remuneration packages in each geography are appropriate and competitive for that talent market;\n- \u00b7 Foster entrepreneurship by rewarding value creation for shareholders through organic and acquisitive growth;\n- \u00b7 Provide an appropriate blend of /fixed and variable remuneration and short and long-term incentives; and\n- \u00b7 Re/flect the risk policies and appetite of the Group\n\nTable 15\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Summary of Key Decisions/Activities\n\nRemuneration Review /Stakeholder Engagement\n\nSalary\n\nAnnual Bonus Plan\n\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP)\n\nFinance Director Remuneration Arrangements\n\nWe consulted with stakeholders on the renewal of the Group's remuneration policy and proposals to incorporate sustainability and diversity measures into our incentive plans (see Table 40 on page 105 for more details).\n\nThe 2022 Policy will be submitted to shareholders for approval at the 2022 AGM (see pages 88 to 97).\n\nWe approved a 2.75% increase in salary for executive Directors in 2022.

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Overview - continued\n\nIn line with the commitment made in the Directors' Remuneration Report submitted to the 2021 AGM, the Committee also reviewed CRH's incentive structures to ensure they are appropriately aligned with the Board's strategic ESG priorities and ambitions, including those related to sustainability and diversity.\n\nHaving re/flected on feedback from shareholders during the Board's on-going and regular shareholder engagement process, considered the evolving external environment (including the perspectives of wider stakeholder groups), and reviewed the current policy in the context of CRH's overall strategy and the priorities and ambitions mentioned above, the Committee concluded that the core elements of the current policy continue to be appropriate for CRH at this time. We, therefore, invited feedback from shareholders on a proposal to submit for approval a largely unchanged policy, with the exception of a proposed reduction in the minimum weighting for any measure in the Performance Share Plan (PSP) scorecard to 15% of the award opportunity (currently 25%). This proposed change provides greater /flexibility around measure selection for future award cycles and allows for the inclusion of sustainability and diversity measures for the 2022 award as outlined below. All other aspects of the current policy (and our approach to its implementation) will remain unchanged.\n\n## Proposed 2022 PSP scorecard\n\nFollowing the review referred to above, the proposed change to our policy will enable the Committee to incorporate sustainability and diversity metrics into the PSP for 2022, with a weighting of 15% of the total award opportunity. This would supplement the current /financial metrics which we propose to reweight as set out in Table 16.\n\nFor 2022, it is proposed that the Sustainability & Diversity component would comprise three subcategories of 5% each:\n\n- \u00b7 Driving towards carbon neutrality;\n- \u00b7 Revenue from Products with Enhanced Sustainability Attributes; and\n- \u00b7 Inclusion & Diversity\n\n## Proposed 2022 PSP scorecard\n\nThe PSP is viewed as being the most effective vehicle for incentivising progress towards our sustainability ambition, recognising the long-term nature of our targets. The PSP is cascaded to c. 775 participants across the organisation on consistent terms, reinforcing collective behaviours to deliver our goals.\n\nThe Committee considered alternative approaches to accommodating this additional performance category to the PSP scorecard, but concluded that the proposed weightings strike an appropriate balance between ensuring a meaningful focus on sustainability and broadly maintaining the existing relative weighting of our /financial metrics. The Committee also considered including safety performance as a PSP measure. However, the Committee believes that safety should remain an override consideration when assessing outcomes under the short-term annual bonus plan.\n\nThe targets for these Sustainability & Diversity measures for the 2022 cycle, which were developed by the SESR Committee in conjunction with management, are set out on in Table 40 on page 105.\n\n## Shareholder Consultation\n\nIn November 2021, we shared details of the proposed policy update with shareholders, requesting their feedback on this. In total we contacted investors holding just over 50% of CRH's share capital, with responses received representing in excess of 30% of our share capital. Overall, the proposals were positively received.\n\nThe Committee and the Board was appreciative of shareholders' engagement through the consultation, and the feedback received. The Committee considered speci/fic comments from two shareholders about the relative weighting of TSR compared to the other /financial measures and whether this was at the right level, and whether the sustainability measures could be upweighted by incentivising the I&D measure in the annual bonus plan rather than the PSP. In weighing up this feedback, the Committee particularly noted the strong level of support for the proposals which formed the basis of the consultation. Therefore, while noting the small number of suggestions regarding reweighting\n\nTable 16\n\n| Measure                    | 2021 PSP   | 2022 PSP (proposed)   |\n|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| Cash Flow                  | 50%        | 45%                   |\n| RONA                       | 25%        | 20%                   |\n| Relative TSR               | 25%        | 20%                   |\n| Sustainability & Diversity | -          | 15%                   |\n\nvarious measures, the Committee has concluded that the structure outlined above remains appropriate for the 2022 award cycle. This position will continue to be kept under review for future awards under the PSP, to ensure the scorecard continues to align closely with our strategic priorities.\n\n## Workforce Engagement\n\nAs outlined in the SESR Committee report on page 78, the SESR Committee, whose members include the majority of the members of the Remuneration Committee, undertook an employee engagement exercise, supported by the Group's Human Resources team, with employees from Europe and the US in a number of sessions promoting two-way dialogue. From a remuneration perspective, we explained the Group's approach to remuneration, which for roles with greater levels of responsibility has a higher emphasis on performance related pay (and, in particular, long-term performance), and the way in which incentive structures are cascaded through the organisation generally. The broad feedback from employees was that our remuneration structures support a focus on long-term sustainable success and there was an appreciation that the signi/ficant level of variable pay, a signi/ficant proportion of which is payable in CRH shares and subject to deferral periods and potential clawback, incentivises long-term value creation and a strong alignment with the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. Employees also told us that there was strong support for the proposals to incorporate Sustainability & Diversity measures into the remuneration policy, given the importance of those initiatives to the workforce and wider society more generally.\n\n## Group Finance Director\n\nThe Board appointed a new Finance Director, Jim Mintern, on 1 June 2021. Jim was previously Chief of Staff in the Of/fice of the Chief Executive and has held various senior operational and /financial roles in CRH since he joined the Group in 2002. Details of the remuneration package agreed by the Committee for Jim with effect from his date of appointment are set out in Table 17 on page 83.\n\nThe Committee was mindful of ensuring that this package is in keeping with our principles (as set out earlier) of being motivational, fair and providing an appropriate blend of /fixed remuneration, short and long-term incentives, that aligns closely with shareholder interests. To inform this decision, the Committee reviewed the internal equity of the package and, with the support of our external adviser benchmarked it relative to other FTSE50 companies (excluding /financial services, and on",

Taking into account these additional reference points, the Committee believes that the package is appropriate.\n\nSenan Murphy retired from the Board following the 2021 AGM and as Finance Director on 1 June 2021. He continued as an executive in order to support the successful transition of the Finance Director role and will remain for a time as an employee to facilitate the completion of a number of ongoing projects/initiatives. He is expected to retire from CRH in 2022 and relevant remuneration details will be disclosed at the appropriate time.\n\n## 2021 Remuneration\n\nThe Committee's approach to remuneration, and the way in which the metrics selected by the Committee incentivise management are aligned with CRH's strategy and support the long-term performance of the Group, are summarised in Tables 19 and 21 on pages 85 and 86 respectively. A summary of 2021 remuneration is set out in Table 18 on page 85.\n\n## Fixed Pay\n\nAs reported in the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report, salary increases of 2.75% were awarded to the executive Directors in January 2021, in line with the average increase awarded to the general workforce.\n\nThe planned phased reduction of the Chief Executive's payment in lieu of pension contributions continued to be implemented in 2021, with a further 10% reduction in the amount that would otherwise have been paid. It has been reduced further from 1 January 2022 to below 25% of his 2022 salary, reducing to zero in August 2022 in line with his contractual arrangements.\n\n## Incentive Targets in 2021\n\nAs was noted in the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report, the targets for the 2021 annual bonus plan and the 2021 PSP awards were set in early 2021 in the context of unprecedented uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we noted that, in the event that certain assumptions underlying the process of setting those targets did not transpire, revised targets might be required to appropriately assess the underlying performance of the Group.\n\n## 2021 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nAs visibility improved on the impact of COVID-19 on the economies and construction markets in which CRH operates, mid-way through the year the Committee reviewed and revised upwards the /financial targets for the 2021 annual bonus plan. Performance against these revised targets determined the outcome of the /financial element of the bonus, which represents 80% of the potential bonus opportunity.\n\n## Jim Mintern - Remuneration Arrangements (i)\n\nAs a result of the record /financial performance of the Group in 2021 and highest ever EBITDA (as de/fined)* outturn of $5.35 billion, the maximum target under each of the /financial metrics was exceeded, resulting in a calculated payout level of 100%. Details of the revised targets for 2021 for each of the EPS, operating cash /flow and RONA metrics, and the very strong performance against those targets, are set out in Table 32 on page 98. The remaing 20% of the annual bonus plan related to personal and strategic objectives. These are outlined on page 99.\n\nNotwithstanding the outperformance during the year, both management and the Committee recognise the ongoing economic and social impact of the pandemic, and in that context judged that it would be appropriate to cap the bonus outcome in respect of the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan at 85% of maximum.\n\nIn line with CRH's remuneration policy, 33% of the earned bonus payments will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. For Jim Mintern, a deferral of 25% applied for the period up to his appointment as Finance Director in June 2021.\n\nTable 17\n\n| Component                                                         | Level                                                                                                                    | Context                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u20ac838,000 p.a.

        "page_content": "## Chairman's Overview - continued\n\n## 2021 PSP Award\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the targets for the 2021 PSP awards mid-way through the year and revised upwards the targets for the RONA and cash /flow metrics (see Table 36 on page 100 for more details).\n\n## 2019 PSP Award\n\nThe vesting of the 2019 PSP award, which covered the three /financial years from 2019 to 2021 inclusive, has been assessed by the Committee against the cash /flow, TSR and RONA targets which were set in early 2019. CRH's strong performance against these measures resulted in the vesting of 100% of these awards (see Table 33 on page 99 for more details).\n\n## Overall incentive outcome\n\nThe Committee is satis/fied that there is a very strong alignment between the incentive outcomes outlined above for 2021 and the performance of the Company. The Committee also took into account a number of factors, including, feedback from other Committees in relation to matters such as safety performance, whether any extraneous factors outside the control of management had unduly in/fluenced the outcome and considered progress in relation to strategic objectives not captured by the /financial measures used for remuneration purposes, and the experience of key stakeholder groups (including employees). The Committee concluded that there was no requirement to use its discretion to adjust incentive outcomes in respect of any of these matters.\n\n## Implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2022\n\n## Fixed Pay\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the executive Directors' base salaries and concluded that salary increases of 2.75% should also be awarded to Albert Manifold and Jim Mintern in 2022 in recognition of their continued strong performance, contribution and leadership of CRH. The approved increase is in line with the general workforce increase in Ireland and the UK.\n\n## Incentives\n\nThe 2022 annual bonus plan will continue to re/flect the structure, weightings and metrics used in prior years: EPS, operating cash /flow, RONA and personal/strategic objectives. The targets attaching to the 2022 bonus will be disclosed in the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nAs outlined previously, the metrics for the PSP awards in 2022 will comprise cash /flow, TSR, RONA and Sustainability & Diversity measures. The targets are set out in Table 40 on page 105.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\nA Committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors recommended that the fees of the non-executive Directors be increased with effect from 1 January 2022 by reference to the wider workforce increase of 2.75% in Ireland and the UK. The non-executive Director fee structure to apply under the 2022 Policy is set out in Table 41 on page 105.\n\n## Group Chairman\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the fee level for the Group Chairman, taking into account the performance of the Chairman since his appointment in 2020 and the nature and extent of his time commitment to ful/fil his responsibilities. We also reviewed CRH's fee level relative to other FTSE50 companies (excluding /financial services). The Committee has increased the Chairman's fee from \u20ac630,000, the amount set for the role when the current policy was approved by Shareholders in 2019, to \u20ac647,250 with effect from 1 January 2022 by reference to the increase for the wider workforce in Ireland and the UK of 2.75%.\n\n## 2022 AGM\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, shareholder approval will be sought in respect of three separate remuneration related resolutions:\n\n- \u00b7 the Directors' Remuneration Report, which is an advisory vote on the way in which our remuneration policy was implemented in 2021, and the Committee's proposed approach to its implementation in 2022;\n- \u00b7 the updated 2022 remuneration policy, which includes the policy changes outlined above; and\n- \u00b7 a resolution to increase the limit on Directors' fees. In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company and Irish company law, shareholders set the maximum aggregate amount of the fees (basic salary) payable to non-executive Directors. The current limit of \u20ac1,000,000 was set by shareholders at the 2019 AGM. Approval will be sought at the 2022 AGM to increase the limit to \u20ac1,200,000. This change is required as a result of an increased number of non-executive Directors on the Board and to provide /flexibility for fee increases over time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs set out above, 2021 was another year of strong performance and value creation for shareholders due to the efforts of our employees and the leadership of the senior executive team. The Committee strongly believes there is a very close alignment between this performance and the remuneration outcomes for the executive Directors. We also believe that the enhancements to the remuneration policy will support and incentivise the achievement of our strategic priorities and the long-term sustainable success of the Group, and are in line with the expectations of our shareholders and wider stakeholders. We look forward to your support for the remuneration-related resolutions on the agenda of the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Lamar McKay\n\nChairman of the Remuneration Committee 2 March 2022",

The Board and the Committee are regularly updated on the perspectives of our employees and take these perspectives into account when making remuneration decisions. Further details in relation to workforce engagement on remuneration matters are set out on page 82.\n\nThe Committee also has oversight of remuneration policy across the Group and endeavours to keep the principles and structure of remuneration consistent in so far as is possible given CRH's international footprint.\n\nGenerally speaking, total remuneration is more variable (and, in particular, weighted towards long-term performance) for roles with greater levels of responsibility and scope.\n\nIn setting the remuneration policy and practices for executive Directors, the Committee also takes into consideration the six pillars outlined in the 2018 Code; clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture, and is satis/fied that the 2022 Policy addresses each of these areas (see page 88 for further details).",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## Proposed 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nAs outlined in the Committee Chairman's Statement on page 81, the Committee carried out a detailed review of the Group's remuneration arrangements during 2021. In doing so, the Committee took into account the strong support from shareholders for the 2019 Policy and our approach to its implementation over its life, as well as feedback from shareholders during the year. The Committee also noted the support from employees in various engagement sessions during 2021 for the introduction of ESG targets in the long-term performance share plan. The principal proposed changes to the 2019 Policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, are set out on page 82. The following sets out the full updated 2022 Policy (the \"2022 Policy\").\n\nThe 2022 Policy, if approved, will provide the framework for remuneration decisions made by the Remuneration Committee. It is the Company's intention that the 2022 Policy will apply until the 2025 AGM, unless the Remuneration Committee seeks shareholder approval for a renewed policy at an earlier date.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's aim is to make sure that CRH's pay structures are fair, responsible and competitive, in order that CRH can attract and retain staff of the calibre necessary for it to compete in all of its markets.\n\nThe Group's remuneration structures are designed to drive performance and link reward to the responsibilities and individual contribution of executives, while at the same time re/flecting the risk policies of the Group. It is our policy to grant participation in the Group's performance-related plans to key management to encourage alignment with shareholders' interests.\n\nIn setting remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and scope and trends in executive remuneration generally, in each of the regions in which the Company operates.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of managing any con/flicts of interest. Therefore, no individual is involved in determining his/her own remuneration arrangements. The Committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive Directors, with neither the Chairman nor any executive Director being being present when their respective individual remuneration is being considered or approved. The remuneration of the non-executive Directors, including the Committee members, is determined by a committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors.\n\n## CRH's Approach to Remuneration\n\nThe purpose of the 2022 Policy is to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReward and motivate executives to perform in the long-term interests of the shareholders\n\nAttract and retain executives of the highest calibre\n\nFoster entrepreneurship within the Group by rewarding the creation of shareholder value through organic and acquisitive growth\n\nProvide an appropriate blend of /fixed and variable remuneration and short and long-term incentives\n\nRe/flect the spread of the Group's operations so that remuneration packages in each geography are appropriate and competitive for that area\n\nRe/flect the risk policies and appetite of the Group\n\nIn formulating the 2022 Policy, the Committee sought to ensure that it and the Group's remuneration practices were consistent with the six factors set out in Provision 40 of the 2018 Code:\n\n## Clarity\n\nThe 2022 Policy is designed to be sustainable and simple. The policy updates in 2022 are few in number and focused on enabling alignment with clearly de/fined and communicated strategic priorities\n\n## Simplicity\n\nThe 2022 Policy utilises market standard annual bonus and long-term incentive plans, the operation of both of which are clearly explained in detail and well-understood by participants\n\n## Risk\n\nThe 2022 Policy has been designed to ensure that inappropriate risk taking is discouraged with a balanced use of annual and longer term incentives, best practice measures such as signi/ficant in-employment and post-employment shareholding requirements to align the long-term interests of executives and shareholders; and the use of clawback and malus provisions. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to override formulaic outcomes; any use of such discretion will be disclosed in the relevant Remuneration Report\n\n## Predictability\n\nThe possible outcomes under the 2022 Policy are quanti/fiable. Illustrations of potential outcomes under various scenarios are included in this report\n\n## Proportionality\n\nThe 2022 Policy has been designed to ensure that there is a clear link between pay outcomes and the delivery of the Group's strategy and performance. A signi/ficant proportion of the executive Directors' potential remuneration is 'at risk' and is subject to clearly de/fined and stretching performance targets\n\n## Alignment to Culture\n\nThe 2022 Policy is designed to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Group. The performance metrics and targets used in the annual and long-term incentive plans re/flect our values and key strategic priorities",

Awards may be (i) adjusted in accordance with the rules in the event of a variation of the Company's share capital, merger, de-merger, special dividend or other event that, in the opinion of the Committee, materially affects the price of shares; and (ii) amended in accordance with the plan rules.\n\n## Clawback/Malus\n\nFor Deferred Annual Performance-related Incentive plan awards and Performance Share Plan awards, the Committee has the discretion to reduce or impose further conditions on awards prior to vesting in certain circumstances, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 a material misstatement of the Group's audited /financial results;\n- \u00b7 a material failure of risk management; or\n- \u00b7 serious reputational damage to the Group or one of its businesses as a result of a participant's misconduct or otherwise\n\nCash bonus payments are subject to clawback of the net amount paid for a period of three years from payment in the circumstances outlined. Vested PSP awards are subject to clawback for a period of three years from the date of vesting.\n\nOther elements of remuneration are not subject to clawback or malus provisions.\n\n## General\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of of/fice (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before 7 May 2014 (the\n\ndate the Company's /first shareholder-approved Directors' Remuneration Policy came into effect); (ii) before the policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved Directors' Remuneration Policy in force at the time they were agreed; (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company; or (iv) in settlement of statutory employment rights. For these purposes 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Minor Amendments\n\nThe Committee may make minor changes to the 2022 Policy for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation without seeking shareholder approval for that amendment.\n\n## Information Supporting the Policy Table\n\nSelection of Performance Measures and Targets\n\n## (i) Annual bonus\n\nAnnual incentive plan targets are selected each year to incentivise executive Directors to achieve annual /financial, operational, strategic and personal goals across a range of metrics which are considered important for delivering long-term performance excellence.\n\n## (ii) Performance share plan\n\nThe ultimate goal of our strategy is to provide growth and long-term sustainable value for all of our shareholders. Performance measures are selected each year. For PSP awards to be granted in 2022, the measures are, therefore, focused on generating cash in the business, achieving relative outperformance of TSR against our key peers, generating a return on net assets and promoting the achievement of the Group's key sustainability and diversity objectives.\n\nTargets and measures for the annual bonus and PSP are set each cycle by the Committee taking into account internal plans and external expectations. Targets are calibrated to be stretching but motivational to management and to be aligned with the long-term creation of shareholder value.\n\n## Remuneration Arrangements Throughout the Group\n\nCRH operates signi/ficant operations in c. 3,235 locations in 28 countries with approximately 77,400 employees across the globe. Remuneration arrangements throughout the organisation, therefore, differ depending on the speci/fic role being undertaken, the level of seniority and responsibilities, the location of the role and local market practice. However, remuneration arrangements are designed based on a common set of principles: that reward should be set at a level which is appropriate to retain and motivate individuals of the necessary calibre to ful/fil the roles without paying more than is considered necessary. The reward framework is designed to incentivise employees to deliver the requirements of their roles and add value for shareholders.\n\nThe Group operates share participation plans and savings-related share option schemes for eligible employees, including executive Directors, in all regions where the regulations permit the operation of such plans.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for New Hires\n\nCRH has a strong history of succession planning and developing internal executive talent.\n\nThe Committee's key principle when determining appropriate remuneration arrangements for a new executive Director (appointed from within the organisation or externally) is that arrangements are in the best interests of both CRH and its shareholders without paying more than is considered necessary by the Committee to recruit an executive of the required calibre to develop and deliver the business strategy.",

        "page_content": "The Committee would generally seek to align the remuneration package offered with our remuneration policy outlined in Table 23 on pages 89 to 91. When determining appropriate remuneration arrangements the Committee will take into account all relevant factors including (among others) the level of opportunity, the type of remuneration opportunity being forfeited and the jurisdiction the candidate was recruited from. Any remuneration offered would be within the limit on variable pay outlined in this 2022 Policy.\n\nVariable remuneration in respect of an executive Director's appointment shall be limited to 590% of base salary measured at the time of award. This limit is in line with the plan maximum outlined in Table 23 on pages 89 to 91. This limit excludes any awards made to compensate the Director for awards forfeited from his or her previous employer.\n\nThe Committee may make awards on appointing an executive Director to 'buy-out' remuneration terms forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which they were granted (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they would have vested. The Committee's key principle is that generally buy-out awards will be made on a comparable basis to those forfeited.\n\nTo facilitate awards outlined above, the Committee may grant awards under Company incentive schemes or under UK Listing Rule 9.4.2 which allows for the granting of awards, to facilitate, in unusual circumstances, the recruitment of an executive Director, without seeking prior shareholder approval or under other relevant company incentive plans. The use of Listing Rule 9.4.2 shall be limited to buyout awards.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Approach to Setting Fees\n\n## Basis of Fees\n\n## Other Items\n\n- \u00b7  The remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined by a Board committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors\n- \u00b7  The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman within the framework or broad policy agreed with the Board\n- \u00b7  Remuneration is set at a level which will attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a substantial contribution to the Company's affairs and re/flect the time and travel demands of Board duties\n- \u00b7  Fees are set taking into account typical practice at other companies of a similar size and complexity to CRH\n- \u00b7  Fees are reviewed annually\n- \u00b7  Fees are paid in cash\n- \u00b7  Non-executive Director fees policy is to pay:\n- -a basic fee for membership of the Board;\n- -an additional fee for chairing a Committee;\n- -an additional fee for the role of Senior Independent Director;\n- -an additional fee to re/flect committee work (combined fee for all committee roles); and\n- -an additional fee based on the location of the Director to re/flect time spent travelling to Board meetings\n- \u00b7  Other fees may also be paid to re/flect other Board roles or responsibilities\n- \u00b7  In accordance with the Articles of Association, shareholders set the maximum aggregate amount of the fees payable to non-executive Directors. The current limit of \u20ac1,000,000 was set by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in 2019. Approval will be sought at the 2022 AGM to increase the limit to \u20ac1,200,000.\n- \u00b7  The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company's performance-related incentive plans or share schemes\n- \u00b7  Non-executive Directors do not receive pensions\n- \u00b7  Where relevant, the Group Chairman may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in travelling from his residence to his CRH of/fice on a gross up basis so that he is not at a net loss after deduction of tax\n- \u00b7  Bene/fits including retirement gifts (provided they do not exceed the de minimis threshold outlined on page 104) may be provided if, in the view of the Board (for non-executive Directors or for the Chairman), this is considered appropriate. The Company may gross up any expenses so that the non-executive Directors are not at a net loss after deduction of tax. Details regarding any bene/fit provided will be disclosed in the relevant year of receipt\n\nIn the event that an internal candidate is promoted to the Board, legacy terms and conditions will normally be honoured, including any outstanding incentive awards.\n\nIn the event of the appointment of a new Chairman or non-executive Director, remuneration arrangements will normally re/flect the policy outlined in Table 24. Other remuneration arrangements may be provided to a new Chairman or non-executive Director if these arrangements are considered appropriate in accordance with the principles set out in Table 24.\n\nTable 24",

        "page_content": "## Executive Director Service Contracts and Policy on Payment for Loss of Of/fice\n\nWhen determining leaving arrangements for an executive Director the Committee takes into account any contractual agreements (including any incentive arrangements) and the performance and conduct of the individual.\n\n## Service Contracts\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director have entered into service contracts with the Company. The summaries in Tables 28 and 29 set out the key remuneration terms of those contracts. All incentive arrangements remain at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any other payments in connection with a director's cessation of of/fice or employment where the payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of a compromise or settlement of any claim arising in connection with the cessation of a director's of/fice or employment.\n\nUnder Irish company law, CRH is not required to make service contracts available for inspection as the notice period is not more than 12 months. Service contracts will only be available with the executive Director's consent due to data protection reasons.\n\n## Annual Cash Bonus\n\nExecutive Directors may, at the discretion of the Committee, remain eligible to receive an annual bonus award for the /financial year in which they leave employment. Such awards will be determined by the Committee taking into account time in employment and performance.\n\n## Share Plan Rules - Leaver Provisions\n\nThe treatment of outstanding share awards in the event that an executive Director leaves is governed by the relevant share plan rules. Table 30 on page 96 summarises leaver provisions under the executive share plans.\n\n'Good leaver' circumstances are de/fined in the 2014 Performance Share Plan and deferred annual performance-related incentive plans as ill-health, injury, disability, the participant's employing company or business being sold out of the Group or any other reason at the Committee's absolute discretion (except where a participant is summarily dismissed).\n\n## Chief Executive Service Contract\n\nNotice period\n\n- \u00b7  12 months' notice by the Company or the executive\n\nExpiry date\n\n- \u00b7  Inde/finite duration\n\nTermination payments\n\nDisability\n\n## Other information\n\n- \u00b7  Terms of contract will automatically terminate on the executive's 62 nd birthday\n- \u00b7  On lawful termination of employment, the Committee may, at its absolute discretion, make a termination payment in lieu of 12 months' notice based on base salary, bene/fits and pension contribution due during that period\n- \u00b7  Where the Company terminates the contract lawfully without notice then no payment in lieu of notice shall be due\n- \u00b7  If, in the event of a change of control, there is a diminution in the role and responsibilities of the Chief Executive he may terminate the contract; on such termination a payment equal to one year's remuneration (being salary, pension, other bene/fits and vested incentive awards) will be made to the executive\n- \u00b7  In the event that the Chief Executive falls ill or is injured in such a way as which would constitute ill-health or disablement so that the Chief Executive could not work for a period of more than six months, in lieu of the early ill-health retirement provisions in the pension scheme which would otherwise operate in such cases, he shall be entitled to receive a disability salary of \u20ac1,000,000 per annum. Such payment would cease when the Chief Executive reaches age 60, returns to work or if the service agreement is terminated\n- \u00b7  The Company retains the ability to suspend the executive from employment on full salary and to require the executive to observe a period of 'garden leave' of up to 12 months on full salary, contractual bene/fits and pension contribution\n\n## Group Finance Director Service Contract\n\nNotice period\n\n- \u00b7  12 months' notice by the Company or the executive\n\nExpiry date\n\n- \u00b7  Inde/finite duration\n\nTermination payments\n\nDisability\n\n## Other information\n\n- \u00b7  Terms of contract will automatically terminate on the executive's 65 th birthday\n- \u00b7  On lawful termination of employment, the Committee may, at its absolute discretion, make a termination payment in lieu of 12 months' notice based on base salary, bene/fits and pension contribution due during that period\n- \u00b7  Where the Company terminates the contract lawfully without notice then no payment in lieu of notice shall be due\n- \u00b7  In the event that the Finance Director falls ill or is injured in such a way as which would constitute ill-health or disablement so that the Finance Director could not work for a period of more than six months, in lieu of the early ill-health retirement provisions in the pension scheme which would otherwise operate in such cases, he shall be entitled to receive a disability salary equivalent to two-thirds of basic salary per annum. Such payment would cease when the Finance Director reaches age 65, returns to work or if the service agreement is terminated\n- \u00b7  The Company retains the ability to suspend the executive from employment on full salary and to require the executive to observe a period of 'garden leave' of up to 12 months on full salary, contractual bene/fits and pension contribution\n\nWhere an individual leaves by mutual agreement the Committee has discretion to determine the treatment of outstanding share awards.\n\nIndividuals who are dismissed for gross misconduct would not be treated as 'good leavers'.\n\nAwards under the Savings-related Share Option Scheme are treated in accordance with the rules. The rules provide that awards may be exercised\n\nby a participant's executor within 12 months of the date of death, and six months from the date of termination of employment in other circumstances where options automatically become exercisable, for example in the case of retirement.\n\nWhere an executive ceases employment on his own volition or as a result of summary dismissal they will normally forfeit outstanding share incentive awards.\n\nTable 29\n\nTable 28",

The deferred share awards and PSP awards subject to a two-year hold period are not subject to any further performance criteria other than continued employment with the Group.\n\nTable 30\n\n|                                                    | Death                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Leavers in other                                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Deferred Annual  Performance  Incentive Plan  2014 | 'Good Leavers' as determined by the Committee in accordance   with the plan rules \u00b7  Unvested awards vest, unless the  Committee determines otherwise,  to the extent determined by the  Committee \u00b7  Awards in the form of nil-cost options  may be exercised for 12 months from  death (or another period determined  \u00b7  Awards shall normally vest in full at the normal vesting date.

Until the limit is achieved, an agreed portion of any Deferred Share or PSP awards which vest will be transfered on a net of tax basis to the third party to be held in trust for their bene/fit. The shares will be held in Trust on a rolling basis, until their employment ceases and a subsequent two year period has elapsed.\n\n## External Board Appointments\n\nExecutive Directors may accept external non-executive directorships with the prior approval of the Board. The Board recognises the bene/fits that such appointments can bring both\n\nto the Company and to the Director in terms of broadening their knowledge and experience. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Group is considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Non-executive Director Letters of Appointment\n\nNon-executive Directors serve under letters of appointment, copies of which are available for inspection at the Company's Registered Of/fice and at the AGM.\n\nIn line with the 2018 Code, all non-executive Directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders every year at the AGM. All non-executive Director appointments can be terminated by either party without notice. There is no payment in lieu of notice provided.\n\n## Considering Employee Views\n\nThe Board is regularly kept abreast of employees' perspectives and takes them into account when making decisions. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has\n\n## Executive Director Shareholdings as a % of 2022 Base Salary (i)\n\noversight of remuneration policy across the Group and endeavours to keep the structure of remuneration consistent as far as possible. Further details of how the Committee seeks and takes into account employee views when setting remuneration for the executive Directors is set out on page 82.\n\n## Consulting with Shareholders\n\nThe Committee believes that it is very important to maintain open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. CRH consults regularly with shareholders and engaged extensively with shareholders in relation to the 2022 Policy. Shareholder views, and broad indications of support, were important in shaping the /final proposals outlined in the 2022 Policy.\n\nThe Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding remuneration matters more generally and CRH arrangements as appropriate. It is the Committee's intention to continue to consult with major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 31\n\n|             | Guideline   (% of Salary)                                                                       | To be   achieved by                                                                             | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     | Holdings as of 2 March 2022                                                                     |      | Total Interests   (% of Salary)   |\n|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------|\n| A.

        "page_content": "## Annual Report on Remuneration\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee consists of seven non-executive Directors considered by the Board to be independent. They bring the range of experience of large organisations and public companies, including experience in the area of senior executive remuneration, to enable the Committee to ful/fil its role. Their biographical details are set out on pages 56 to 59. A schedule of attendance at Committee meetings is set out in Table 8 on page 73.\n\nThe main focus of the Committee is to:\n\n- \u00b7 determine and agree with the Board the Group's policy on executive remuneration;\n- \u00b7 seek shareholder approval for the Directors' Remuneration Policy at least every three years;\n- \u00b7 ensure that CRH's remuneration structures are fair and responsible; and\n- \u00b7 consider and approve salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the fee for the Chairman\n\nIn addition, the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management; and\n\nIn considering remuneration levels for executive Directors particularly, the Committee takes into account remuneration trends across the CRH Group, which has a diverse range of operations in 28 countries, in geographic regions which are often at different stages in the economic cycle.\n\nThe Committee also engages regularly with shareholders and (via the SESR Committee see page 78 for more details) employees on the structure of the remuneration policy and executive incentives.\n\n## Remuneration Received by Executive Directors in Respect of 2021\n\nDetails of individual remuneration for executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2021, including explanatory notes, are given in Table 22 on page 87. Details of Directors' remuneration charged against pro/fit in the year are given in Table 49 on page 109.\n\nThe Group changed its reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020. Notwithstanding this, as the executive Directors are paid in euro, the Committee considers it appropriate that the remuneration /figures disclosed in this Report continue to be presented in euro.\n\n- \u00b7 oversees the preparation of this Directors' Remuneration Report\n\n## 2021 Annual Bonus Plan - Achievement\n\n## 2021 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nCRH's Annual Bonus Plan for 2021 was based on a combination of /financial targets and personal/strategic goals. The metrics for target payout, which is up to a maximum of 50% of the total annual bonus opportunity, are based on achieving the budget set by the Board in respect of each metric. The threshold level for bonus payouts in 2021 was for the achievement of 92.5% of budget, whereas maximum payout is achieved for stretch performance of 107.5% of budget. The relative weighting of the components of the 2021 plan are set out in Table 32.\n\nWhen setting the targets for the annual bonus plan, the Committee makes assumptions regarding exchange rates and development activity. The Committee also compares the proposed targets to the outturn for the previous year to ensure that the targets are suf/ficiently stretching. In this regard, it is important to note that the metrics in the plan are in/fluenced by the economic cycle and other factors, such as ongoing portfolio management, government infrastructure spending programmes and items outside of management's control and which may not continue into the next /financial year.\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the bonus plan, the Committee typically makes a number of routine adjustments to the /financial targets, for example, to re/flect, signi/ficant development activity and actual share buyback activity during the year.\n\nTable 32\n\n|                     |                                | 2021 Targets - Performance needed for payout at (i) (ii)   | 2021 Targets - Performance needed for payout at (i) (ii)   | 2021 Targets - Performance needed for payout at (i) (ii)   |                                   |                                       |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Measure             | Weighting   (% of total bonus) | Threshold                                                  | Target                                                     | Maximum                                                    | 2021  Performance  Achieved (iii) | Percentage of  Maximum   Awarded (iv) |\n| CRH EPS (iii)       | 25%                            | 247.2c                                                     | 267.3c                                                     | 287.3c                                                     | 320.8c                            | 21.25%                                |\n| CRH Cash Flow (iii) | 30%                            | $3,000m                                                    | $3,244m                                                    | $3,487m                                                    | $3,874m                           | 25.50%                                |\n| CRH RONA (iii)      | 25%                            | 9.9%                                                       | 10.7%                                                      | 11.5%                                                      | 12.4%                             | 21.25%                                |\n| Personal/Strategic  | 20%                            |                                                            |                                                            |                                                            | See page 99                       | 17.00%                                |\n| Total               | 100%                           |                                                            |                                                            |                                                            |                                   | 85.00%                                |",

        "page_content": "As outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chairman's overview on page 83, the targets for the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan were set in early 2021 in the context of unprecedented uncertainty presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. As visibility improved on the impact of COVID-19 on the economies and construction markets in which CRH operates, mid-way through the year the Committee reviewed and revised upwards the /financial targets for the 2021 annual bonus plan. Performance against these revised targets determined the outcome of the /financial element of the bonus, which represents 80% of the potential bonus opportunity. As a result of the record /financial performance of the Group in 2021 and highest ever EBITDA (as de/fined)* outturn of $5.35 billion, the maximum target under each of the /financial metrics was exceeded, resulting in a calculated payout level of 100%. Details of the revised targets for 2021 for each of the EPS, operating cash /flow and RONA metrics, and the very strong performance against those targets, are set out in Table 32 on page 98.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan was linked to performance against key personal and strategic objectives, including inclusion & diversity, organsiational change management and management succession and strategy.\n\nAchievements in relation to these objectives included:\n\n- \u00b7 advancing the I&D agenda, driving \"tone from the top\" actions and supporting inclusive behaviours across the senior leadership team, communicating CRH's vision and aspirations in this area, ensuring capability training was delivered and that the proper structures and supports are in place to drive towards CRH's 2030 targets in this area;\n- \u00b7 providing leadership together with the senior leadership team to drive organisational change programmes across the Group and working closely with the Board in relation to designing the process for the long-term CEO succession process and senior management succession generally; and\n- \u00b7 the continued assessment of strategic alternatives for the Group and working closely with the senior leadership team to align the organisational structure of CRH with its evolving strategy\n\nNotwithstanding the outperformance during the year, both management and the Committee recognise the ongoing economic and social impact of the pandemic, and in that context judged that it would be appropriate to cap the bonus outcome in respect of the /financial metrics and personal strategic measures at 85% of maximum. Further details are set out in Table 32 on page 98.\n\nIn line with CRH's remuneration policy, 33% of the earned bonus payments will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. For Mr. Mintern, for the period up to his appointment as Finance Director on 1 June 2021 a deferral of 25% applies.\n\n## 2019 Performance Share Plan Award Metrics\n\n## Long-term Incentives\n\n## Performance Share Plan 2019 awards\n\nIn 2019, the executive Directors were granted conditional awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan. The awards were based on TSR (25% of the award) against a tailored group of key peers (see Table 37 on page 100, Cumulative Cash Flow (50% of the award) and RONA (25% of the award), and performance was measured over the three-year period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021. In respect of the TSR element, CRH's TSR over the period is ranked in the top quartile of the tailored peer group weighted by market capitalisation and warrants 100% vesting for the TSR element. In respect of the cumulative cash /flow element, the actual outturn over the period was $7.9 billion, which exceeded the stretch target of $5.5 billion, resulting in 100% vesting for the cash /flow element. In respect of the RONA element, the RONA outturn was 12.4%, resulting in 100% vesting for the RONA element.\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the metrics, the Committee considered a number of adjustments, for example, to neutralise the impact of signi/ficant acquisitions and divestments, to re/flect the Group's change in reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020, the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 Leases and the impairment of subsidiaries in 2020.\n\nTable 33\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (i) Further information on how cash /flow is calculated for PSP awards is set out on page 101.\n- (ii) The methodology for calculating TSR assumes all dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date at the closing share price on that day; the open and close price is based on the three-month average closing price on the last day before the start of the performance period and the /final day of the performance period respectively. For the 2019 awards, TSR performance is assessed on a weighted market capitalisation basis.\n- (iii) RONA is also de/fined as reported internally and differs from the RONA reported in the Non-GAAP Performance Measure in this report as it re/flects seasonality and timing impact of development activity.\n- (iv)    For the purposes of the 2019 Award, TSR performance was in the top quartile against the tailored peer group (see Table 37 on page 100). The cumulative cash /flow for the three years to end 31 December 2021 was $7.9 billion. RONA at 31 December 2021 was 12.4%.\n- * EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.",

        "page_content": "The Committee considers that the vesting outcome is re/flective of the Company's underlying performance over the performance period. In accordance with the Policy, the 2019 awards to Albert Manifold and Senan Murphy will vest in 2024 on completion of an additional two-year holding period. The 2019 award for Jim Mintern was granted prior to his appointment as Group Finance Director and, under the terms of the award, is not subject to an additional holding period. Accordingly, the award will vest in April 2022. Vested awards will be adjusted to accrue dividend equivalents based on dividends in the period from grant to the applicable date of vesting. Table 33 on page 99 sets out details of the relevant targets. Table 35 sets out details of the awards.\n\n## Performance Share Plan 2021 awards\n\nDuring 2021, awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan were made to the executive Directors, details of which are summarised in Table 38. 50% of each award granted in 2021 is subject to a cumulative cash /flow metric. The de/finition of cash /flow, which applies to the cash metric for all PSP awards, is the net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents adjusted to exclude:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 acquisition/investment expenditure;\n- \u00b7 proceeds from divestments and movements in working capital;\n- \u00b7 share issues (scrip dividend, share options, other);\n- \u00b7 /financing cash /flows (new loans/repayments);\n- \u00b7 back funding pension schemes; and\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange translation\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers that it is appropriate to make these adjustments to align with the performance targets, or to remove items that do not re/flect the quality of management's operational performance, or are largely outside of the Company's control. The Remuneration Committee will also make adjustments that may be required to cash /flows, for example, as a result of acquisitions/divestments completed during the performance period or a signi/ficant underspend or delay in budgeted capital expenditure, both ordinary and extraordinary.\n\n25% of each award is subject to a TSR metric, with performance being measured against a tailored peer group and on a market capitalisation weighted basis (see Table 37). The remaining 25% of each award is subject to a RONA metric, a key measure used by management to assess investment opportunities and to run the business.\n\nPerformance for the awards made in 2021 will be assessed over the three-year period to 31 December 2023.\n\nAs explained in last year's Report, the 2021 PSP targets were set in the context of unprecedented and ongoing uncertainty currently presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the Committee retained the discretion to revise the /financial targets (the TSR targets not being impacted) in the event that it subsequently transpired that using these targets would be inappropriate for assessing the underlying performance of the Group. Mid-way through the year (see page 83 for more details), the Committee concluded that the cash /flow and RONA targets attaching to the 2021 PSP should be revised upwards in light of improved visibility primarily on trading expectations. These revised targets are considered to represent signi/ficant stretch compared to the Board's strategic plan and prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Vesting will remain subject to the Committee's discretionary assessment of the formulaic outcome in the context of underlying Group performance. Details of the performance targets are set out in Table 36 on page 100.\n\nAwards, to the extent that they vest, will be adjusted for dividend equivalents based on dividends in the period from grant to the date of vesting in 2025. 'Malus' and clawback provisions apply to the awards.\n\n## Other Employee Share Plans\n\nThe executive Directors are eligible to participate in Irish Revenue approved Savings-related Option Schemes (the 'SAYE Scheme') and Share Participation Schemes (the 'Participation Scheme') on consistent terms with all other employees. The SAYE Scheme is open to all Irish and UK employees, although at present there is currently no /financial services provider supporting new awards under Irish SAYE schemes following the exit from the market of the current provider in 2021. Participants may save up to \u20ac500/\u00a3500 a month from their net salaries for a /fixed term of three or /five years and at the end of the savings period they have the option to buy CRH shares at a discount of up to 15% of the market price on the date of invitation of each savings contract. Details of the outstanding awards of executive Directors under the 2010 SAYE Scheme are set out in Table 39 on page 102.\n\nThe Participation Scheme is an Irish Revenue approved plan and is open to all employees in Ireland. Grants can be made to participants up to a maximum of \u20ac12,700 annually in CRH shares. Albert Manifold, Jim Mintern and Senan Murphy participated in the Participation Scheme in 2021.\n\n## Retirement Bene/fit Expense\n\nAlbert Manifold is a participant in a contributory de/fined bene/fit plan which is based on an accrual rate of 1/60th of salary 1 for each year of pensionable service and is designed to provide two-thirds of career average salary at retirement for full service. Albert Manifold will become entitled to a deferred pension, payable from Normal Retirement Age, if he leaves service prior to Normal Retirement Age. The Finance Act 2006 established a cap on pension provisions by introducing a penalty tax charge on pension assets in excess of the higher of \u20ac5.4 million (in the Finance Act 2011, this threshold was reduced to \u20ac2.3 million and reduced further to \u20ac2 million by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013) or the value of individual accrued pension entitlements as at 7 December 2005.\n\nAs a result of these legislative changes, the Remuneration Committee decided that executive Directors should have the option of continuing to accrue pension bene/fits as previously, or of choosing an alternative arrangement-by accepting pension bene/fits limited by the cap-with a similar overall cost to the Group. Albert Manifold has opted for an arrangement whereby his pension is capped in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2006 and receives a supplementary taxable non-pensionable cash supplement in lieu of pension bene/fits foregone. There was, therefore, no additional accrual in 2021. The cash pension supplement for 2021 is detailed in Table 22 on page 87. This supplement is similar in value to the reduction in the Company's liability represented by the pension bene/fits foregone. It is calculated based on actuarial advice as the equivalent of the reduction in the Company's liability to Mr. Manifold and spread over the term to retirement as annual compensation allowances. In 2020, Mr. Manifold agreed to a voluntary reduction of 10% of the amount that would otherwise have been due to him. This was reduced by a further 10% in 2021 and will be below 25% of salary form 1 January 2022, reducing to zero in August 2022. The contributory de/fined bene/fit plan in which Albert Manifold participates closed to new entrants at the end of 2011. Details regarding the pension entitlements of Albert Manifold are set out in Table 34 on page 100.\n\nSenan Murphy receives a taxable non-pensionable cash payment in lieu of a pension contribution, which, for the reasons set out in the previous year's report, is capped at 25% of his 2020 base salary. As outlined on page 83, Jim Mintern receives a taxable non-pensionable cash payment of 10% of salary in lieu of a pension contribution in line with that available to the wider UK and Irish workforce.",

        "page_content": "## Annual Report on Remuneration - continued\n\n## Shareholding Guideline for Executive Directors\n\nThe shareholding guideline for the executive Directors is set out on page pages 96 and 97, together with a table showing the current shareholdings of the executive Directors as a multiple of base salary.\n\n## Proposed Implementation of Remuneration in 2022\n\n## Basic Salary and Bene/fits\n\nDetails of the executive Directors' salaries for 2022 compared with 2021 are set out in the Committee Chairman's Overview on page 83. The Committee has reviewed the executive Directors' base salaries and concluded that salary increases of 2.75% should also be awarded to the executive Directors in 2022 in recognition of their continued strong performance, contribution and leadership of CRH. The approved increase is in line with the general workforce increase in Ireland and the UK. Executive Directors will receive bene/fits in line with the 2022 Policy in 2022. The level of bene/fits provided will depend on the cost of providing individual items and the individual circumstances.\n\n## Retirement Bene/fit Expense\n\nAs outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chairman's overview on page 83, the monetary value of the pension contribution/allowance for Mr. Manifold has been reduced to below 25% of his salary for 2022 and will expire in August 2022. The annual pension contribution/allowance for Jim Mintern remains at 10% of his base salary.\n\n## 2022 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2022 Annual Bonus Plan will be operated broadly in line with the 2021 Annual Bonus Plan. 80% of the bonus will be based on /financial targets and the remaining 20% on individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive Director. The targets attaching to the 2022 bonus will be disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## 2022 Performance Share Plan Awards\n\nFor the 2022 PSP awards, awards will be assessed over the three-year period to 31 December 2024. The metrics, weightings and opportunity for the 2022 PSP awards are summarised in Table 40 on page 105.\n\n## Fees Paid to Former Directors\n\nThe 2013 Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment Regulations) Regulations in the UK, require disclosure of payments to former Directors in certain circumstances. No payments have been made to individual former Directors in those circumstances which exceed the de minimis threshold of \u20ac20,000 per annum set by the Remuneration Committee. For the purposes of Section 1110N of the Companies Act 2014, details of the payments made to former Directors are included in Table 49 on page 109.\n\n## Executives' External Appointments\n\nThe executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board provided that such appointments do not prejudice the individual's ability to ful/fil their duties at the Group. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Group is considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of non-executive Directors is determined by the Board of Directors. The fees were last increased in 2019. As outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chairman's overview on page 84, a Committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors recommended that the fees of the non-executive Directors be increased with effect from 1 January 2022 by reference to the wider workforce increase of 2.75% in Ireland and the UK. The fee structure for nonexecutive Directors to apply under the 2022 Policy is set out in Table 41 on page 105. Taking into account the performance of the Chairman since his appointment in 2020 and the nature and extent of his time commitment to ful/fil his responsibilities, the Committee reviewed CRH's fee levels relative to other FTSE50 companies (excluding /financial services) and recommended that the Chairman's fee be increased from \u20ac630,000, the amount set for the role when the current policy was approved by Shareholders in 2019, to \u20ac647,250, with effect from 1 January 2022, by reference to the increase for the wider workforce of 2.75%. Details of the remuneration paid to non-executive Directors in 2021 are set out in Table 42 on page 106.\n\n## Total Shareholder Return\n\nThe value at 31 December of \u20ac100 invested in CRH in 2011, compared with the value of \u20ac100 invested in the Euro/first 300 Index and the FTSE100 Index (which CRH joined in December 2011) is shown in Table 45 on page 107.\n\nTSR performance has been compared against the FTSE100 and the Euro/first 300 as these are broad general market indices of which CRH is a constituent. The Committee, therefore, considers that they offer a reasonable comparison for performance. Compound annual TSR since the formation of the Group in 1970 (assuming the reinvestment of dividends) is 15.5% (2020: 15.1%).\n\n## Workforce Engagement\n\nEngagement of our workforce is at the heart of what we do at CRH. The proximity of our senior leaders to daily operations across CRH is a key reason for the Company's continued success and growth. The Company operates an annual talent and performance review process, where colleagues and their managers work together to review performance and set annual goals. The outcome of the review process is closely aligned to remuneration, both in terms of any increase in base salary for the next year, and any variable remuneration component.\n\nIn order to guide our leaders' discussions with employees across the group on remuneration structures, there is a reward policy section, which is based on the principles of remuneration applied by the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy approved by shareholders, in policy documents issued to the managing directors of our operating companies.\n\nThe SESR Committee has taken formal responsibility for workforce engagement. Remuneration Committee members are kept up-to-date on the workings of the SESR Committee and the feedback it receives from employees on all matters including remuneration. Further details in relation to the engagement with employees on remuneration matters during 2021 is included on page 82.\n\n## Changes in the remuneration of the Directors\n\nTable 48 on page 109 shows the percentage change in the executive and non-executive Directors' salary/fees, bene/fits and bonus between 2020 and 2021 compared to the change in total average employment costs in respect of employees in the Group as a whole between 2020 and 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Annual Report on Remuneration - continued\n\n## Remuneration Paid to Chief Executive 2012 - 2021\n\n## Chief Executive Pay Ratio compared to UK-based employees\n\nAs required by the reporting regulations with which CRH complies, Table 44 on page 107 summarises the ratio of the Chief Executive's remuneration compared with the UK workforce (which represents only 13% of the Group's c.77,400 employees). In last year's Report, the Committee noted an expectation for year-on-year variations in the reported pay ratio to be driven by performance-based pay outcomes which, in line with our remuneration policy, comprise a signi/ficant proportion of the total remuneration\n\nfor the Chief Executive. While the majority of employees across CRH also participate in performance-related incentives, these typically comprise a lower proportion of the package (in line with competitive market practices for these roles and levels). Consistent with our philosophy across the Group that incentives should be linked to performance that an individual can in/fluence, these more commonly re/flect an individual's own (and own business unit) performance, compared with a linkage to Group performance for the Chief Executive and other senior executives.\n\nIn keeping with our remuneration philosophy\n\nand policy, a signi/ficant proportion of the total remuneration for Executive Directors is derived from variable, performance-based remuneration. Total remuneration for the Chief Executiveand therefore the pay ratio- is likely to vary year-on-year based on the Group's performance, as illustrated in the scenario charts on page 94. Noting that the total remuneration pay ratio will be volatile over time, the Committee has elected to continue also disclosing the pay ratio for base salary. In line with the Committee's policy that Executive Directors' base salaries will normally\n\nincrease in line with the typical level of increase awarded to other employees in the Group, it is anticipated that this ratio will be more stable - and representative of relative changes in /fixed pay over time.\n\nThe median total remuneration pay ratio for 2021 of 289:1 demonstrates continued alignment of the Chief Executive's remuneration with the performance of CRH over the longer-term. A signi/ficant proportion (62%) of the Chief Executive's total remuneration for 2021 is derived from the vesting of the 2019 PSP award, which was based on the delivery of sustained /financial performance and above-market shareholder returns over the last three years. Through the denomination of this award in CRH shares, its value also re/flects directly CRH's share price performance over this period; 31% of the PSP value reported in the Single Figure of Total Remuneration table derives from share price appreciation. These shares cannot be sold for a further two years, further aligning the Chief Executive's interests with those of shareholders over the longer-term.\n\n## Individual Remuneration for Non-executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2021 (Audited) Table 42\n\nTable 43 on page 107 shows the total remuneration paid to the Chief Executive in the period 2012 to 2021 inclusive and shows bonuses and vested long-term incentive awards as a percentage of the maximum bonus and award that could have been received in respect of each year. Albert Manifold succeeded Myles Lee as Chief Executive in January 2014.\n\n|                         | Basic fees (i)   \u20ac000   | Basic fees (i)   \u20ac000   | Bene/fits (ii)  \u20ac000    | Bene/fits (ii)  \u20ac000    | Other fees (iii)  \u20ac000   | Other fees (iii)  \u20ac000   | Total  \u20ac000             | Total  \u20ac000             | Total  \u20ac000             |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                         | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021                    | 2020                    | 2019                    |\n| Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors  | Non-executive Directors  | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors | Non-executive Directors |\n| R.

Salary and total remuneration /figures have been rounded to the nearest 100.\n- 2.   Employee remuneration data converted into Euros at the average quarter four EUR:GBP exchange rate (source: Central Bank of Ireland). For 2021 this rate was 0.85:1 (2020: 0.90:1; 2019: 0.86:1).\n- 3.   Total remuneration for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees are determined using the 'single /figure' methodology. This methodology was chosen as it provides a like-for-like comparison between the CEO and other employees. For practical reasons (primarily relating to the number of employing entities and employees covered by this analysis), the ranking of employees to identify the three individuals representing P25, P50 and P75 is conducted in November each year. Given the timing, for the purpose of the ranking exercise, total remuneration is de/fined as the sum of base salary, employer pension contributions and other taxable bene/fits for the period 1 January to 31 October, and the incentive paid in the period in respect of the prior year. All elements of remuneration are calculated on a full-time and full-year equivalent basis. In the following January, total remuneration is updated for the three employees representing P25, P50 and P75 using the same single /figure methodology used to report CEO remuneration.\n- 4.   The Committee considered the pay data for the three individuals identi/fied and believes that they fairly re/flect pay at the relevant quartiles amongst the UK employee population, albeit noting the exact /figures are likely to vary slightly year-on-year due to changes in the employee population and thus the identi/fied individuals. The Committee reviewed the underlying rationale for the year-on-year change in the quartile /figures. Total remuneration increased year-on-year re/flecting the resumption of more normal trading conditions, including payment of overtime in the UK businesses. The year-on-year variance in salaries at the quartiles, re/flects the fact that the individuals were selected based on total remuneration and the pay mix differs by role and location. On a like-for-like basis, the budgeted salary increase across the UK workforce in 2021 was 2.75%.\n\n## TSR Performance (2011-2021)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further details in relation to the buyback programme and the Company's pro/fits available for distribution are set on pages 113 and 205 respectively.\n\n## Dividend\n\nCRH's capital allocation policy re/flects the Group's strategy of generating industry leading returns through value-accretive allocation of capital while delivering long-term dividend growth for shareholders. The Board continues to believe that a progressive dividend policy is appropriate for the Group and further to the 25% dividend increase in 2020, an interim dividend of 23.0c (2020: 22.0c) per share was paid in October 2021. The Board is recommending a /final dividend of 98.0c per share. This would give a total dividend of 121.0c for the year (2020: 115.0c), an increase of 5% over last year. The earnings per share for the year were 328.8c, representing a cover of 2.7x the proposed dividend for the year. It is proposed to pay the /final dividend on 5 May 2022 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 11 March 2022. In connection with the share buyback programme, CRH announced the suspension of the scrip dividend scheme on 2 May 2018. Therefore, the /final dividend will be paid wholly in cash. Re/flecting the resilience of our business model and continued strong cash generation the Board believes that a through-the-cycle dividend cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times is appropriate for the Group going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report - continued\n\n## Going Concern\n\nThe time period that the Directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis in preparing the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements is a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these /financial statements (the 'period of assessment').\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategy Review and in this report on pages 6 to 35 and pages 116 to 121. The /financial position of the Group, its cash /flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Business Performance Review on pages 36 to 53. In addition, notes 21 to 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its /financial risk management objectives; details of its /financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, currency and liquidity risks. The Group has considerable /financial resources and a large number of customers and suppliers across different geographic areas and industries and the local nature of building materials means that the Group's products are not usually shipped cross-border. The level of cash and liquidity available to the Group including our ongoing ability to access the debt markets, the quantum of our liquidity facilities, the absence of /financial covenants associated with our debt obligations and the continuing maintenance of strong investment grade credit ratings demonstrate the signi/ficant /financial strength and resilience of the Group. No concerns or material uncertainties have been identi/fied as part of our assessment.\n\nHaving assessed the relevant business risks, including the climate change risk on page 118, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage these risks successfully and they have a reasonable expectation that CRH plc, and the Group as a whole, has adequate /financial and other resources to continue in operational existence for the period of assessment with no material uncertainties. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nThe viability statement set out on page 35 is deemed to be incorporated in this section of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control 1\n\nThe Directors con/firm that, in addition to the monitoring carried out by the Audit Committee under its Terms of Reference, they have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems up to and including the date of approval of the /financial statements. This review had regard to all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group's business.\n\n## Directors' Compliance Statement\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to comply with its relevant obligations (as de/fined in the Companies Act 2014). The Directors have drawn up a compliance policy statement (as de/fined in section 225(3)(a) of the Companies Act 2014) and arrangements and structures are in place that are, in the Directors' opinion, designed to secure material compliance with the Company's relevant obligations. The Directors con/firm that these arrangements and structures were reviewed during the /financial year. As required by Section 225(2) of the Companies Act 2014, the Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Company's compliance with the relevant obligations. In discharging their responsibilities under Section 225, the Directors relied on the advice both of persons employed by the Company and of persons retained by the Company under contract, who they believe have the requisite knowledge and experience to advise the Company on compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nResolution 3 to be proposed at the 2022 AGM deals with the 2021 Directors' Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy Report), as set out on pages 80 to 109, which is being presented to shareholders for the purposes of a non-binding advisory vote in line with the requirements of Section 1110N(6) of the Companies Act, 2014.\n\nResolution 4 to be proposed at the 2022 AGM deals with the Remuneration Policy, as set out on pages 88 to 97. The 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy will, if approved, provide the framework for remuneration decisions made by the Remuneration Committee. It is the Company's intention that this will apply until the 2025 AGM, unless the Remuneration Committee seeks shareholder approval for a renewed policy at an earlier date.\n\n## Directors' Fees\n\nAn ordinary resolution (resolution 5) will be proposed at the 2022 AGM to increase the limit of the aggregate fees for non-executive Directors to \u20ac1,200,000. The current limit, approved at the 2019 AGM, is \u20ac1,000,000. The proposed increase is required as a result of an increase in the number of non-executive Directors.\n\n## Changes to the Board of Directors\n\n- \u00b7 Ms. C. Dowling was appointed to the Board with effect from 22 March 2021;\n- \u00b7 Ms. H.A. McSharry, Mr. S. Murphy and Ms. L.J. Riches retired from the Board with effect from 29 April 2021; and\n- \u00b7 Mr. B. Khan was appointed to the Board with effect from 27 October 2021\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, co-opted Directors are required to submit themselves to shareholders for election at the AGM following their appointment and all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at intervals of not more than three years. However, in accordance with the provisions contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has decided that all Directors eligible for re-election should retire at each AGM and offer themselves for re-election.\n\n## Auditor\n\nAs required under Section 381(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014, the AGM agenda includes a resolution authorising the Directors to /fix the remuneration of the auditor.\n\nSection 383 of the Companies Act 2014 provides for the automatic re-appointment of the auditor of an Irish company at a company's AGM, unless the auditor has given notice in writing of his unwillingness to be re-appointed or a resolution has been passed at that meeting appointing someone else or providing expressly that the incumbent auditor shall not be re-appointed. The auditor, Deloitte Ireland LLP, is willing to continue in of/fice.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Irish company law, the Board has decided to provide shareholders with an opportunity to have a say on the continuance in of/fice of Deloitte Ireland LLP and a non-binding resolution has been included on the agenda for the 2022 AGM for this purpose.",

        "page_content": "## Authority to Allot Shares\n\nThe Directors require the authority of the shareholders to allot any unissued Ordinary Share capital of the Company. Accordingly, an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 2022 AGM (resolution 9) to renew the annual authority for that purpose. The authority will be for an amount which represents just under 50% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at 2 March 2022. Any allotment exceeding 33% of the issued Ordinary Share capital will only be made pursuant to a pre-emptive issue and no issue of shares will be made which could effectively alter control of the Company without prior approval of the Company in General Meeting.\n\nThe Directors have no present intention of making any issue of shares, other than in connection with the Group's share incentive plans and, if applicable, scrip dividend scheme.\n\nIf approved, this authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2023 or 27 July 2023.\n\n## Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights\n\nResolutions 10 and 11 are special resolutions which, if approved by shareholders, will renew the annual authorities of the Directors to disapply statutory pre-emption rights in relation to allotments of Ordinary Shares for cash in certain circumstances.\n\nResolution 10 will, if approved, authorise the Directors to allot Ordinary Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash (otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive issue) up to a maximum nominal value of \u20ac12,386,000. This amount represents approximately 5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at 2 March 2022, being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document. This resolution will also allow the Directors to disapply pre-emption rights in order to accommodate any regulatory restrictions in certain jurisdictions where the Company might otherwise wish to undertake a pre-emptive issue.\n\nResolution 11 will, if approved, afford the Directors with an additional power to allot Ordinary Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis and for cash up to a further 5% of the issued share capital as at 2 March 2022. The power conferred by this resolution can be used only in connection with an acquisition or a speci/fied capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue, or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.\n\nThe 5% limits in the disapplication resolutions include any Treasury Shares reissued by the Company during the same period.\n\nThe Directors con/firm that in respect of these resolutions, they intend to follow the Statement of Principles updated by the Pre-Emption Group in that allotments of shares for cash and the reissue of Treasury Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis (other than for an open offer or rights issue to Ordinary Shareholders, the operation of CRH's employee share schemes or in connection with an acquisition or speci/fied capital investment) will not exceed 7.5% of the issued Ordinary Share capital within a rolling three-year period without prior consultation with shareholders.\n\n## Transactions in Own Shares\n\nUnder the share buyback programme, a total of 17,829,602 Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 2.2% of the Company's issued share capital, were repurchased during 2021, at an average price of $49.30 per share. 21,000,000 Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 2.6% of the Company's issued share capital were cancelled on 29 December 2021 as part of the Group's management of its Treasury Share requirements. As at 2 March 2022, 8,240,813 shares were held as Treasury Shares, equivalent to 1.06% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (excluding Treasury Shares). The Treasury Share balance at 31 December 2021 was 3,476,859, equivalent to 0.5% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (2020: 10,087,161 (1.28%)).\n\nDuring 2021, 3,439,904 (2020: 1,375,338) Treasury Shares were reissued under the Group's employees' share schemes.\n\nA special resolution will be proposed at the 2022 AGM (resolution 12) to renew the authority of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase up to 10% of the Company's Ordinary Shares in issue at the date of the AGM.\n\nIf approved, the minimum price which may be paid for shares purchased by the Company shall not be less than the nominal value of the shares and the maximum price will be 105% of the higher of the last independent trade in the Company's shares (or current independent bid, if higher) and the average market price of such shares over the preceding /five days. A special resolution will also be proposed for the purpose of renewing the authority to set the maximum and minimum prices at which Treasury Shares (effectively shares purchased and not cancelled) may be reissued off-market by the Company. If granted, both of these authorities will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2023 or 27 July 2023. As at 2 March 2022, options\n\nto subscribe for a total of 1,217,351 Ordinary Shares are outstanding, representing 0.16% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding Treasury Shares). If the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares was used in full, the options would represent 0.17% of the remaining shares in issue.\n\nAs outlined on page 19, during 2021 the Group returned a further $0.9 billion of cash to shareholders under its share buyback programme. A further buyback tranche of $0.3 billion is underway and is scheduled to complete by 30 March 2022.\n\nWhile no decision has been made to extend the programme beyond this, the Board believes that the Company should retain the ability to buyback its own shares so that it can be used in the best interests of shareholders generally.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Notice of Meeting for the 2022 AGM will be published in March on the CRH website (www.crh.com) and is expected to be posted to shareholders on 30 March 2022.\n\n## Statement of Directors' Responsibilities\n\nThe Directors as at the date of this report, whose names are listed on pages 56 to 59, are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Form 20-F and Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIrish company law requires the Directors to prepare /financial statements for each /financial year which give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, /financial position of the Parent Company and of the Group, and of the pro/fit or loss of the Group taken as a whole for that period (the 'Consolidated Financial Statements').\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- \u00b7 comply with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the /financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the /financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business",

This year we used profit before tax, which is a focus area of investors and analysts and is the benchmark traditionally considered for listed entities.

The Group did not record an impairment charge during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key observations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the recoverable amount of goodwill of each cash generating unit (CGU) to its carrying value. The Group used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe focused on CGUs where the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by an insignificant amount and on CGUs which had a significant change in cash flow forecasts compared to the prior year. Based on these procedures we identified certain CGUs of interest and performed sensitivities on key management estimates and assumptions, with the assistance of our valuation specialists. We determined that the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill of one selected CGU was a key audit matter because it required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 68.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates of one CGU, as described above, used by management to estimate the recoverable amount of the selected CGU included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's determination of the short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates used to determine the recoverable amount of the selected CGU.\n- \u00b7 We agreed the underlying cash flow forecasts to the Board approved projections and we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues by:\n- \u00b7 performing a look-back analysis and comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the impact of macroeconomic activity on short-term cash flows;\n- \u00b7 benchmarking management's forecasts against independent third-party economic and industry projections; and\n- \u00b7 comparing internal Group communications to management and the Board against the cash flow forecasts to evaluate for consistency.\n- \u00b7 We compared the long-term growth rates, used by management to grow cash flows from year 5 to year 10 in order to calculate a terminal value at that point, to independent external sources and developed our own range to assess the reasonableness of these rates.\n- \u00b7 We compared the actual results for the year ended 31 December 2021 to management's forecasts at the date of the annual impairment test to determine if any indicators of impairment existed.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we have determined management's assumptions used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill associated with selected CGUs to be reasonable.\n\nWe concluded that the related disclosures provided in the Group Financial Statements are appropriate.",

The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue and is calculated based on the proportion of the contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. The accounting for these contracts involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition for long-term contracts as a key audit matter because of the judgements made by management to estimate total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in certain components. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates of total costs and evaluating the results of those procedures.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 68.\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's estimates of total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in selected components included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to accurately estimate the total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Group's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts; and\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable.\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we are satisfied that management's estimated percentage-of-completion at the balance sheet date is appropriate and reasonable when assessed against our own independent expectations and our assessment of the accuracy of historical estimates against actual costs.\n\nOur audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.",

We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                         | Group financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Company financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Materiality                             | $140 million (2020: $110 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | $103 million (2020: $94 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Basis for   determining   materiality   | The materiality that we used for the Group financial   statements was determined on the basis of profit before tax   and represents 4.19% of that metric.   We adopted a different basis to determine materiality in the                                                                                                                                                                                                          | The materiality that we used for the Company financial statements was   determined on the basis of total equity/net assets and represents   approximately 1% of that metric.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Rationale for the   benchmark   applied | We conducted an assessment to determine the financial   statement items of most importance to investors and   analysts by reading analyst reports and CRH's   communication to shareholders. This resulted in us selecting   profit before tax as the most appropriate benchmark.   Moreover, profit before tax is traditionally considered the   most appropriate benchmark for listed entities. Group   materiality represents: | The Company holds the Group's investments and is not in itself profit- oriented. The strength of the balance sheet is the key measure of financial   health that is important to shareholders since the primary concern for the   Company is the payment of dividends. Using a benchmark of equity/net   assets is therefore the appropriate metric. |\n| Rationale for the   benchmark   applied | Metric   %                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Rationale for the   benchmark   applied | PBT   4.19%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance materiality was set at 80% of each of Group and Company materiality for the 2021 audit (2020: 75%). In the prior year, a lower level of performance materiality was set due to the fact that it was the first year of our audit tenure and due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In determining the current year performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\n\n- a. our risk assessment, including our assessment of the Group's overall control environment and that we consider it appropriate to rely on controls over a number of business processes;\n- b. our experience from the prior year audit; and\n- c. the level of corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified in the prior period.\n\n## Error reporting threshold\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them any audit differences in excess of $7 million (2020: $5.5 million), as well as differences below that threshold which, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## Identification and scoping of components\n\n- \u00b7 The Group consists of three operating and reporting segments and is highly decentralised in nature, with a presence across 28 countries and over 3,200 operating entities. As a result a significant portion of audit planning time was spent to ensure that the scope of our work is appropriate to address the Group's identified risks of material misstatement.\n- \u00b7 In-scope locations were identified based on their contribution to the applicable benchmarks i.e. revenue, total assets and profit before tax.\n- \u00b7 We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit of 5 components which were subject to a full audit and 43 components which were subject to specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the associated risks of material misstatement and of the materiality of the components operations to the Group. 23 components were subject to specific procedures on certain account balances by component audit teams or the Group audit team, and the remaining 20 were subject to substantive analytical procedures performed centrally by the Group audit team.\n- \u00b7 Data analytics were performed centrally and used extensively in selecting the components and addressing the residual entities which were not in-scope based on the considerations listed. In addition, we analysed disaggregated financial data related to residual entities not subject to full or specified scope audit procedures in order to identify any unusual movements or relationships.\n- \u00b7 Our audit work for all components were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from $40 million to $100 million.\n\n## Working with other auditors\n\nThe Group audit team planned its site visits to component auditors based on a variety of factors including size of entity and number of significant risks. Oversight and guidance is provided to the component auditors through a combination of:\n\n- \u00b7 issuance of Group referral instructions;\n- \u00b7 upfront team briefings to all component teams;\n- \u00b7 site visits (physically, where possible and if not virtually); and\n- \u00b7 risk assessment discussions and detailed workpaper reviews.",

In addition we assess the competence of our component auditors.\n\nA combination of physical, where possible, and virtual site visits were performed at key locations during the year.\n\nWe held regular meetings with management at a regional and Group level in order to update our understanding of the Group and its environment on an ongoing basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe classify components according to the following scoping categories:\n\n- 1)  Scope A - Full scope integrated audit procedures have been performed by local audit teams to a component materiality. These are financially significant to the Group and include risks relevant to the Group audit.\n- 2)  Scope B - Specified integrated audit procedures on prescribed balances and specific controls have been performed by component teams or the Group audit team to component materiality. Scope B also contains Risks of Material Misstatements and associated procedures performed at Group level. The Scope B entities are not individually financially significant to the Group.\n- 3)  Scope C - Defined audit procedures consisting of focused risk assessments and analytical reviews have been performed by the Group audit team. The Scope C entities are not individually financially significant to the Group.\n- 4)  Residual - As Risks of Material Misstatements have been determined to be remote for components and balances included in the residual, the Group engagement team performs analytical procedures, which are not substantive in nature, to determine whether the audit risk has been reduced to an acceptable level.\n\n## Our consideration of climate-related risks\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impacts of the climate-related risks identified by management on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set out their 2025 carbon reduction targets in their sustainability review on page 21. The Group have also identified climate change and policy as part of their principal operational risks and uncertainties on page 118. They have set out the potential impacts of their physical risks and transitional risks on their business on page 118 and their Taxonomy eligible economic activities on page 243.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have obtained management's climate-related risk assessment and made inquiries of management to understand their process for considering the impact of climate-related risks. The Group reflected the impact of stated 2025 carbon reduction targets on assumptions used in setting key estimates recorded in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requirements.\n\nWe have performed our own risk assessment of the potential impact of the 2025 carbon reduction climate targets outlined by the Group and how they may affect judgements and estimates included in the financial statements. The main climate-related implications considered as part of our audit relate to the impact of climate change on cash flow projections underlying intangible assets. These projections include assumptions on costs of carbon and future climate-related capital expenditure required to meet the 2025 carbon reduction targets. Our audit procedures were performed with the involvement of our sustainability and valuation specialists. We also challenged how the directors considered climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability.\n\nWe assessed if the assumptions used by management in the financial statements were consistent with their 2025 carbon reduction targets and as set out in their accounting policies, on pages 145 to 154. In early 2022, the Group adopted a new target of a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 compared to 2020 levels and we considered management's disclosure as set out on page 145.\n\nWe have also read the Group's disclosure of climate-related information in the front half of the annual report, including the TCFD disclosures listed on pages 28 to 31.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report and Form 20-F, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.",

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and otherwise comply with the Companies Act 2014, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs (Ireland), we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group and Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity (or where relevant, the Group) to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Group auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. The Group auditor remains solely responsible for the audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that the auditor identifies during the audit.\n\nFor listed entities and public interest entities, the auditor also provides those charged with governance with a statement that the auditor has complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, including the Ethical Standard for Auditors (Ireland), and communicates with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on the auditor's independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nWhere the auditor is required to report on key audit matters, from the matters communicated with those charged with governance, the auditor determines those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. The auditor describes these matters in the auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, the auditor determines that a matter should not be communicated in the auditor's report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2021, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 2 March 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n135",

The Company did not record an impairment charge during the year.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the recoverable amount of goodwill of each cash generating unit (CGU) to its carrying value. The Company used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates, short-term forecasts of revenues and margins, and long-term growth rates which drive net cash flows. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nWe focused on CGUs where the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value by an insignificant amount and on CGUs which had a significant change in cash flow forecasts compared to the prior year. Based on these procedures we identified certain CGUs of interest and performed sensitivities on key management estimates and assumptions, which included the assistance of our valuation specialists.\n\nWe determined that the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill of one selected CGU was a critical audit matter because it required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates of one CGU, as described above, used by management to estimate the recoverable amount of the selected CGU included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's determination of the short-term forecasts of revenues and long-term growth rates used to determine the recoverable amount of the selected CGU.\n- \u00b7 We agreed the underlying cash flow forecasts to the Board approved projections and we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues by:\n- \u00b7 performing a look-back analysis and comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the impact of macroeconomic activity on short-term cash flows;\n- \u00b7 benchmarking management's forecasts against independent third-party economic and industry projections; and\n- \u00b7 comparing internal Company communications to management and the Board against the cash flow forecasts to evaluate for consistency.\n- \u00b7 We compared the long-term growth rates, used by management to grow cash flows from year 5 to year 10 in order to calculate a terminal value at that point, to independent external sources and developed our own range to assess the reasonableness of these rates.\n- \u00b7 We compared the actual results for the year ended 31 December 2021 to management's forecasts at the date of the annual impairment test to determine if any indicators of impairment existed.",

The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue and is calculated based on the proportion of the contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. The accounting for these contracts involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating total costs.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition for long-term contracts as a critical audit matter because of the judgements made by management to estimate total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in certain components. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates of total costs and evaluating the results of those procedures.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's estimates of total costs for the performance obligations used to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in selected components included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 evaluated whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to accurately estimate the total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts; and\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable.\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n2 March 2022\n\nThe first accounting period we audited was 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of CRH plc as at 31 December 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended 31 December 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements') of the Company and our report dated 2 March 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n2 March 2022",

IFRS as adopted by the European Union differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial years presented. The Consolidated Financial Statements are also prepared in compliance with the Companies Act 2014 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.\n\nCRH plc, the Parent Company, is a publicly traded limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in US Dollar millions, have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the measurement at fair value of share-based payments, retirement benefit obligations and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn accordance with Section 304 of the Companies Act 2014, the Company is availing of the exemption from presenting its individual profit and loss account to the Annual General Meeting and from filing it with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n## Adoption of IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations\n\nThe following standard amendments  became effective for the Group as of 1 January 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement , IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures , IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IFRS 16 Leases - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2. The amendments did not result in a material impact on the Group's results\n\nThe following standard amendment was issued in March 2021 effective for annual reporting periods\n\nbeginning on or after 1 April 2021 with earlier application permitted:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 - COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021. The amendment was adopted effective 1 January 2021 and did not result in a material impact on the Group's results\n\n## IFRS and IFRIC interpretations being adopted in subsequent years\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 which will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with presentation of comparative figures required. The Group is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on future periods which is not expected to be material.\n\nThere are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective subsequent to the CRH 2021 financial year-end that are expected to have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.\n\n## Climate Change and Carbon Reduction Targets\n\nIn August 2021, the Group announced that its carbon emissions reduction target of 520kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious material was being brought forward from 2030 to 2025. Climate change risks including the impact of achieving this target have been considered and assessed in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. The table below provides details of where further information has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Climate Change and 2025 Carbon Reduction Target References\n\n|                                                                    | Pages       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Impairment testing of goodwill and   property, plant and equipment | 150 and 175 |\n| Provisions for liabilities                                         |             |\n| Inventories                                                        |             |\n| Retirement Benefit Obligations                                     |             |\n\n147\n\n152\n\n198\n\nIn early 2022, the Group adopted a new target of a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 compared to 2020 levels. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has approved our science-based emissions reduction target. The Group's assessment is that the impact of the adoption of this target will be consistent with the impact of the 2025 targets on the estimates, judgements and assumptions set out in the relevant disclosures referenced above.\n\nIn line with the application of our accounting policies, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis as we continue to develop and implement our strategy to meet the 2030 targets.\n\n## Change in presentation currency\n\nAs outlined in our 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F, on 28 February 2020, the Group announced that with effect from 1 January 2020 it would be changing the currency in which it presents its financial results from euro to US Dollar. Within our current portfolio of businesses, our euro denominated earnings, while sizeable, are a relatively lower proportion of overall earnings. To reduce the potential for foreign exchange volatility in our future reported earnings, the Board determined that, with effect from 1 January 2020, CRH will present its results in US Dollar. Given the current composition of the Group's activities, this change is expected to reduce the impact of currency movements on reported results.\n\n## Key Accounting Policies which involve Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgements upon which it relies are reasonable based on the information available to it at the time that those estimates, assumptions and judgements are made. In some cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by IFRS and does not require management's judgement in its application.\n\nManagement considers that their use of estimates, assumptions and judgements in the application of the Group's accounting policies are inter-related and therefore discuss them together below with the major sources of estimation uncertainty and significant judgements separately identified.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances or experiences on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information.\n\n145",

In assessing value-in-use, the net cash flow forecasts (reflecting revenue forecasts, projected EBITDA (as defined)* margin and other cash flow movements) are extrapolated using long-term growth rates to determine the basis for an annuity-based terminal value. Future cash flows, including the terminal value, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax. Future cash flows relating to the eventual disposal of these CGUs and other factors may also be relevant to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions which influence these variables.\n\nThe assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of goodwill reflect management's best assumptions and estimates, but these items involve\n\ninherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control. As a result, the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods.\n\nA detailed discussion of the impairment methodology applied, key assumptions used and related sensitivity analyses by the Group in the context of goodwill is provided in note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated. Impairment losses arising in respect of goodwill are not reversed once recognised.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. Where indicators of impairment of an investment arise in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , the carrying amount is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are reviewed for potential impairment by applying a series of external and internal indicators specific to the assets under consideration. These indicators encompass macroeconomic issues including the inherent cyclicality of the building materials sector, actual obsolescence or physical damage, a deterioration in forecast performance in the internal reporting cycle and restructuring and rationalisation programmes.\n\nWhere the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount (being the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use), an impairment loss is recognised by writing down the assets to their recoverable amount. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIn assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations Note 28\n\nCosts arising in respect of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in the event that the fund does not hold sufficient assets to meet its benefit commitments.\n\nThe liabilities and costs associated with the Group's defined benefit pension schemes (both funded and unfunded) are assessed either on the basis of the attained age, the projected unit credit, the current unit credit or the aggregate cost methods by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Major sources of estimation uncertainty: Discount rates\n\nThe assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations (including discount rates , rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and healthcare cost trends), from which the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements are determined, are updated annually based on current economic conditions and for any relevant changes to the terms and conditions of the pension and post-retirement plans. These assumptions can be affected by (i) for the discount rate , changes in the rates of return on high-quality corporate bonds; (ii) for future compensation levels, future labour market conditions and (iii) for healthcare cost trend rates, the rate of medical cost inflation in the relevant regions. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used and sensitivity analysis in relation to the significant assumptions employed in the determination of pension and other postretirement liabilities are contained in note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations are the discount rates . The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on highquality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations.\n\nWhilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the obligations and expenses recognised in future accounting periods. The assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes may exhibit significant period-on-period volatility attributable primarily to changes in bond yields and longevity.",

        "page_content": "In addition to future service contributions, significant cash contributions may be required to remediate past service deficits.\n\nThe net surplus or deficit arising on each of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes, are shown either within non-current assets or non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred tax impact of pension scheme surpluses and deficits is disclosed separately within deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nThe defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Plan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of published quoted securities; it is the published bid price. The value of any defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan and reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe Group's obligation in respect of postemployment healthcare and life assurance benefits represents the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is computed on the basis of the projected unit credit method and is discounted to present value using a discount rate equating to the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post-employment obligations.\n\n## Provisions for liabilities - Note 26\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## Significant judgement:\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether the Group has a present obligation and whether it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation. This judgement is applied to information available at the time of\n\ndetermining the liability including but not limited to judgements around interpretations of legislation, regulations, case law and insurance contracts depending on the nature of the provision.\n\nWhere the Group anticipates that a provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will arise. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.\n\nThe increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense. Contingent liabilities arising on business combinations are recognised as provisions if the contingent liability can be reliably measured at its acquisition date fair value. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Management is not aware of any potential changes to key assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of provisions within the next financial year; however due to the nature of some of our provisions, estimates may depend on the outcome of future events and need to be revised as circumstances change in future accounting periods. Refer to note 26 for the expected timing of outflows by provisions category.\n\n## Environmental and remediation provisions\n\nThe measurement of environmental and remediation provisions is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, currently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of sites. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, the protracted length of the clean-up periods and evolving technologies.\n\nThe environmental and remediation liabilities provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the judgement applied by management in respect of information available at the time of determining the liability and are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.\n\nThe impact of climate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 118 and 235 on environmental and remediation provisions has been considered, specifically the impact on timing and extent of costs and cash outflows. Changes to legislation, including those relating to climate change, are factored into the assessment of provisions when the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted. The Group's 2025 carbon emissions target of 520kg of CO 2 per tonne of cementitious\n\nmaterial is also considered in these judgements. The measurement of our provisions is based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist in the foreseeable future. These assumptions do not have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying value of these provisions within the next financial year and therefore do not represent a major source of estimation uncertainty.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control, actual costs and cash outflows could differ if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nThe status of each significant claim and legal proceeding in which the Group is involved is reviewed by management on a periodic basis and the Group's potential financial exposure is assessed. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated, a liability is recognised for the estimated loss.\n\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in such matters, the related provisions are based on the best information available at the time; the issues taken into account by management and factored into the assessment of legal contingencies include, as applicable, the status of settlement negotiations, interpretations of contractual obligations, prior experience with similar contingencies/claims, and advice obtained from legal counsel and other third parties. As additional information becomes available on pending claims, the potential liability is reassessed and revisions are made to the amounts accrued where appropriate. Such revisions in the judgements and estimates of the potential liabilities could have an impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Group in future accounting periods.\n\n## Insurance provisions\n\nInsurance provisions are subject to actuarial valuation and are based on actuarial triangulations which are extrapolated from historical claims experience. These provisions include claims which are classified as 'incurred but not reported', the status of which are reviewed periodically by management, in conjunction with appropriately qualified advisors. Changes in actuarial methodologies and assumptions, along with the receipt of new information, could have an impact on the financial position of the Group through recognition of additional, or release of, provisions in future accounting periods.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies - continued\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and all subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year, and the Group's share of the results of joint ventures and associates which are accounted for using the equity method. The financial year-ends of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are coterminous.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a change in control is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\nWhen the Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other facts and circumstances including contractual arrangements that give the Group power over the investee may result in the Group controlling the investee. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if, and when, facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Parent Company and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, distinguished from Parent Company shareholders' equity. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures - Note 15\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity, but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the\n\narrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date significant influence/joint control is deemed to arise until the date on which significant influence/joint control ceases to exist or when the interest becomes classified as an asset held for sale.\n\nThe Consolidated Income Statement reflects the Group's share of result after tax of the related associates and joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost adjusted in respect of post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets, less any impairment in value. Loans advanced to associates or joint ventures form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IFRS 9, including the impairment requirements, to these loans as the equity method does not apply. If necessary, impairment losses on the carrying amount of an investment are reported within the Group's share of equity accounted investments' results in the Consolidated Income Statement. If the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of an associate or joint venture, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's investments in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its assets and its liabilities, including its share of any assets or liabilities held jointly; its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\n## Revenue recognition - Note 1\n\nThe Group recognises revenue in the amount of the price expected to be received for goods and services supplied at a point in time or over time, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled and control of goods and services passes to the customer. It excludes trade discounts and valueadded tax/sales tax.\n\n## Revenue derived from sale of goods (sources other than construction contracts)\n\nThe Group manufactures and supplies a diverse range of building materials and products. Whilst there are a number of different activities across the Group; recognition of revenue from the sale of goods is similar; being at the point in time when control is deemed to pass to the customer upon leaving a CRH premises or upon delivery to a customer depending on the terms of the sale. Contracts do not contain multiple performance obligations (as defined by IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ).\n\nAcross the Group, goods are often sold with discounts or rebates based on cumulative sales over a period. This variable consideration is only recognised when it is highly probable that it will not be subsequently reversed and is recognised using the most likely amount or expected value methods, depending on the individual contract terms. In the application of appropriate revenue recognition, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of the likelihood and quantum of such items based on experience and historical trading patterns.\n\nThe Group is deemed to be a principal to an arrangement when it controls a promised good or service before transferring them to a customer and accordingly recognises revenue on a gross basis. Where the Group is determined to be an agent to a transaction, based on the principle of control; the net amount retained after the deduction of any costs to the principal is recognised as revenue.\n\nWithin the non-construction contract businesses no element of financing is deemed present as transactions are all made with average credit terms (usually 90 days), consistent with market practice.\n\n## Revenue derived from construction contracts\n\nThe Group enters into a number of construction contracts, to complete large construction projects. Contracts usually commence and complete within one year and are generally fixed price.\n\nThe Group typically recognises revenue within its construction contract businesses over time, as it performs its obligations. Management believe this best reflects the transfer of control to the customer by providing a faithful depiction of primarily the enhancement of a customer controlled asset or the construction of an asset with no alternative use. The percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. The percentage-of-completion is calculated using an input method and based on the proportion of\n\ncontract costs incurred at the balance sheet date",

        "page_content": "relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. In all of our construction contract arrangements the Group has an enforceable right to payment for work and performance obligations completed to date.\n\nSome of the Group's construction contracts may contain forms of variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount or expected value methods (depending on the contract terms) and the transaction price is adjusted to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nIn some instances revenue is recognised in the period subsequent to the contracted work being completed when there is final certainty over the remaining element of variable consideration.\n\n## Recognition of contract assets and liabilities\n\nIn our construction contract businesses, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with pre-agreed contractual terms. When a performance obligation is satisfied but a customer has not yet been billed this is recognised as a contract asset (unbilled revenue) and included within Trade and Other Receivables (note 17). Retentions (representing the percentage of consideration due which is retained by the customer until certain contractual activities are completed) are also a common feature of construction contracts and are recognised as a contract asset within Trade and Other Receivables when we have a right to consideration in exchange for the completion of the contract. Retentions are consistent with industry norms and the purpose of these is not to provide a form of financing. Apart from retentions, the Group does not have any construction contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of its transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\nWhen consideration is received in advance of work being performed, or we have billed an amount to a customer that is in excess of revenue recognised on the contract; this is recognised as a contract liability within Trade and Other Payables (note 18); and the revenue is generally recognised in the subsequent period when the right to recognise revenue has been determined. As a result, advance payments received for construction contract arrangements are not considered a significant form of financing.\n\nCumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, after deducting onerous provisions, provisions for contingencies and payments on account not matched with revenue, are included as construction contract balances in\n\ninventories (note 16). Cost includes all expenditure directly related to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities based on normal operating capacity. The Group's contracts generally are for a duration of less than one year and therefore the Group does not capitalise incremental contract costs; instead expensing as incurred, as permitted by the practical expedient under IFRS 15.\n\n## Onerous contracts and warranties\n\nWhen a contract is identified as being onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic benefit of the contract), a provision is created; being the lower of costs to complete the contract and the cost of exiting the contract. The Group recognises a provision for assurance-type (standard) warranties offered across the Group under its terms and conditions in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . The Group provides assurance-type warranties for general repairs and does not typically provide service-type (extended) warranties.\n\n## Segment reporting - Note 2\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management structure and the internal reporting information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale - Note 3\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. The Group ceases to use the equity method of accounting from the date on which an interest in a joint venture or associate becomes held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly associated with those assets are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Discontinued operations - Note 3\n\nDiscontinued operations are reported when a component of the Group, that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, has been disposed of, or when a sale is highly probable; its operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Group and is classified as held for sale or has been disposed of. The Group classifies a non-current asset or disposal group as held for sale if its carrying value will be recovered through a sales transaction or distribution to shareholders rather than continuing use.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations. Corresponding notes to the Consolidated Income Statement exclude amounts for discontinued operations, unless stated otherwise.\n\n## Share-based payments - Note 8\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans. Details of these plans, together with the nature of the underlying market and non-market performance and other vesting conditions are outlined in note 8. The Group has no material exposure in respect of cash-settled sharebased payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives.\n\n## Awards under Performance Share Plans\n\n25% of the awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to a TSR (and hence market-based) vesting condition measured against a tailored sector peer group. Accordingly, the fair value assigned to the related equity instruments at the grant date is derived using a Monte Carlo simulation technique to model the market-based performance conditions; and is adjusted to reflect the anticipated likelihood as at the grant date of achieving the vesting condition. Awards are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe remaining awards granted under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to non-marketbased vesting conditions; 50% are subject to a cumulative cash flow target and 25% are subject to a RONA metric. The fair value of the awards is calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. At the balance sheet date the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n149",

        "page_content": "150\n\n## Accounting Policies - continued\n\nIf awards which vest under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are allotted to an Employee Benefit Trust, an increase in nominal share capital and share premium are recognised accordingly on allotment.\n\n## Savings-related Share Option Scheme\n\nThe fair values assigned to options under the Savings-related Share Option Scheme are derived in accordance with the trinomial valuation methodology on the basis that the services to be rendered by employees as consideration for the granting of share options will be received over the vesting period, which is assessed as at the grant date.\n\nThe cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The Consolidated Income Statement expense/credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period. The cumulative charge to the Consolidated Income Statement is reversed only where an employee in receipt of share options leaves service prior to completion of the expected vesting period and those options forfeit in consequence.\n\nWhere an award is cancelled, it is treated as if it is vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the Company or the employee are not met. All cancellations of awards are treated equally.\n\nThe proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the determination of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Taxation - current and deferred Notes 10 and 27\n\nCurrent tax represents the expected tax payable (or recoverable) on the taxable profit for the year using tax rates enacted for the period. Where items are accounted for outside of profit or loss, the related income tax is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising at the balance\n\nsheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. For the most part, no provision has been made for temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. However, a temporary difference has been recognised to the extent that specific assets have been identified for sale or where there is a specific intention to unwind the temporary difference in the foreseeable future. Due to the absence of control in the context of associates (significant influence only), deferred tax liabilities are recognised where appropriate in respect of CRH's investments in these entities on the basis that the exercise of significant influence would not necessarily prevent earnings being remitted by other shareholders in the undertaking.\n\nDeferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are subject to review at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that future taxable profits are considered to be inadequate to allow all or part of any deferred tax asset to be utilised.\n\nThe Group's income tax charge is based on reported profit and enacted statutory tax rates, which reflect various allowances and reliefs available to the Group in the multiple tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of the Group's provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. In addition, the Group is subject to tax audits which can involve complex issues that could require extended periods to conclude, the resolution of which is often not within the control of the Group. Although management believes that the estimates\n\nincluded in the Consolidated Financial Statements and its tax return positions are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group's historical income tax provisions and accruals. Whilst it is possible, the Group does not currently anticipate that any such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and profit for the period in which such a determination is made nor does it expect any significant impact on its financial position within the next 12 months. This is based on the Group's knowledge and experience, as well as the profile of the individual components which have been reflected in the current tax liability, the status of the tax audits, enquiries and negotiations in progress at each year-end, previous claims and any factors specific to the relevant tax environments.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment Note 13\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment (excluding leased right-of-use assets) of $17,938 million at 31 December 2021 represents 40% of total assets at that date. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairments except for certain items that had been revalued to fair value prior to the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004).\n\nRepair and maintenance expenditure is included in an asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial period in which it is incurred.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred in the construction of major assets which take a substantial period of time to complete are capitalised in the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policy, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of residual values and useful lives.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\nAmongst other factors, consideration is given to climate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 118 and 235 when determining the useful lives of assets. The determination of useful lives also considers the Group's 2025 carbon",

Capital expenditure will continue to be required for ongoing projects and the useful lives of future capital expenditure may differ from current assumptions, however there were no significant changes in the estimates of useful lives during the current financial year.\n\nFuture developments in technology may also result in a risk of obsolescence for the Group's current portfolio of plant and machinery assets, however the expected time-frame for these developments is not currently anticipated to impact their remaining useful lives as the majority of the Group's plant and machinery assets will be fully depreciated within ten years.\n\nDepreciation and depletion is calculated to write off the book value of each item of property, plant and equipment over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis at the following rates:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\nThe book value of mineral-bearing land, less an estimate of its residual value, is depleted over the period of the mineral extraction in the proportion which production for the year bears to the latest estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves. Land, other than mineral-bearing land, is not depreciated. In general, buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum (p.a.).\n\n## Plant and machinery\n\nThese are depreciated at rates ranging from 3.3% p.a. to 20% p.a. depending on the type of asset. Plant and machinery includes transport vehicles which are, on average, depreciated at 20% p.a.\n\n## Business combinations - Note 30\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred (excluding amounts relating to the settlement of pre-existing relationships), the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and, in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree. Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nTo the extent that settlement of all or any part of consideration for a business combination is deferred, the fair value of the deferred component is determined through discounting the amounts payable to their present value at the date of exchange. The discount component is unwound as an interest charge in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the obligation. Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in the cost of\n\nthe acquisition. The fair value of contingent consideration at acquisition date is arrived at through discounting the expected payment to present value. In general, in order for contingent consideration to become payable, pre-defined profit and/or profit/net asset ratios must be exceeded. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be recognised in profit or loss unless the contingent consideration is classified as equity, in which case it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.\n\nThe assets and liabilities arising on business combination activity are measured at their acquisition-date fair values. Contingent liabilities assumed in business combination activity are recognised as of the acquisition date, where such contingent liabilities are present obligations arising from past events and their fair value can be measured reliably. In the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisitiondate fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss. When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined provisionally, any adjustments to the provisional values allocated to the consideration, identifiable assets or liabilities (and contingent liabilities, if relevant) are made within the measurement period, a period of no more than one year from the acquisition date.\n\n## Goodwill - Note 14\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and relates to the future economic benefits arising from assets which are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. If the cost of the acquisition is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the identification and measurement of the related assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are revisited and the cost is reassessed with any remaining balance recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates and joint ventures is included in investments accounted for using the equity method (i.e. within financial assets) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhere a subsidiary is disposed of or terminated through closure, the carrying value of any goodwill of that subsidiary is included in the determination of the net profit or loss on disposal/termination.\n\n## Intangible assets (other than goodwill) arising on business combinations - Note 14\n\nAn intangible asset is capitalised separately from goodwill as part of a business combination at cost (fair value at date of acquisition).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets (the Group does not currently have any indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill) are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis. In general, based on the current composition of definite-lived intangible assets, the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets range from five to fifteen years and the useful lives for marketing related intangible assets range from ten to twenty years.\n\nAmortisation periods, useful lives, expected patterns of consumption and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\n## Leases - Notes 13 and 20\n\nThe Group enters into leases for a range of assets, principally relating to property. These property leases have varying terms, renewal rights and escalation clauses, including periodic rent reviews linked with a consumer price index and/or other indices. The Group also leases plant and machinery, vehicles and equipment. The terms and conditions of these leases do not impose significant financial restrictions on the Group.\n\nA contract contains a lease if it is enforceable and conveys the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, which is assessed at inception. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised at the commencement date for contracts containing a lease, with the exception of leases with a term of 12 months or less which do not contain a purchase option, leases where the underlying asset is of low value and leases with associated payments that vary directly in line with usage or sales. The commencement date is the date at which the asset is made available for use by the Group.\n\n151",

Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable payments that are dependent on a rate or index known at the commencement date, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees and any payments for an optional renewal period and purchase and termination option payments, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise those options. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for any renewal or termination options which are reasonably certain to be exercised. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate and rentals relating to low value or short-term leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Management applies judgement in determining whether it is reasonably certain that a renewal, termination or purchase option will be exercised.\n\nIncremental borrowing rates are calculated using a portfolio approach, based on the risk profile of the entity holding the lease and the term and currency of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments or when the Group changes its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option within the contract. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, lease incentives received and an estimate of the cost to dismantle or restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term or, where a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, over the useful economic life of the asset in line with depreciation rates for owned property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is tested periodically for impairment if an impairment indicator is considered to exist.\n\nNon-lease components in a contract such as maintenance and other service charges are separated from lease payments and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Inventories - Note 16\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in/ first-out principle (and weighted average, where appropriate) and includes all expenditure incurred in\n\nacquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. Raw materials are valued on the basis of purchase cost on a first-in/ first-out basis. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes direct materials, direct labour and attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity and excludes borrowing costs.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less all further costs to completion, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, taking into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period, the likelihood of short-term changes in buyer preferences, product obsolescence or perishability (all of which are generally low given the nature of the Group's products) and the purpose for which the inventory is held.\n\nClimate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 118 and 235 may also result in additional costs, changes to selling prices or product obsolescence impacting the valuation of inventories in future years. There were no material write-downs of inventories required in this regard during the current financial year.\n\nMaterials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished goods, in which they will be incorporated, are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\n## Trade and other receivables Note 17\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets are its trade and other receivables (including contract assets). Trade and other receivables are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contract and has a legal right to receive cash. Trade receivables (including contract assets) are carried at original invoice amount, which is equivalent to amortised cost, less an expected credit loss provision. Further details on the approach the Group applies to providing for expected credit losses is outlined in note 17.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents Note 23\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are\n\nsubject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost or, in the case of certain money market deposits, fair value through profit or loss.\n\nBank overdrafts are included within current interestbearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where the overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of cash management, they are netted against cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - Note 24\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration received net of directly attributable transaction costs. The computation of amortised cost includes any issue costs and any discount or premium materialising on settlement. Subsequent to initial recognition, current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings are, in general, measured at amortised cost employing the effective interest methodology. Fixed rate loans and borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates (using interest rate swaps), are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in value attributable to the hedged risks arising from changes in underlying market interest rates.\n\nBorrowing costs arising on financial instruments are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred (unless capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging practices - Note 25\n\nIn order to manage interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risks and to realise the desired currency profile of borrowings, the Group employs derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps). Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The carrying value of derivatives is fair value based on discounted future cash flows and adjusted for counterparty risk. Future floating rate cash flows are estimated based on future interest rates (from observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period). Fixed and floating rate cash flows are discounted at future interest rates and translated at period-end foreign exchange rates. Short dated forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the forward foreign exchange risk on currency exposures. The forward price elements to these contracts are excluded from the hedge.",

        "page_content": "At the inception of a derivative transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Where derivatives do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values are reported in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group uses fair value hedges and cash flow hedges in its treasury activities. For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges (which entail hedging the exposure to movements in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment that could affect profit or loss) or cash flow hedges (which hedge exposure to fluctuations in future cash flows derived from a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss).\n\nWhere the conditions for hedge accounting are satisfied and the hedging instrument concerned is classified as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss stemming from the remeasurement of the hedging instrument to fair value is reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. In addition, any gain or loss on the hedged item which is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the Consolidated Income Statement with the objective of achieving full amortisation by maturity.\n\nWhere a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised as other comprehensive income, net of the income tax effect, with the ineffective portion being reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. The associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement contemporaneously with the materialisation of the hedged transaction.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative\n\ngain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised as other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer anticipated to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised as other comprehensive income is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nWhere foreign currency swaps provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign operation, and the hedge is deemed to be effective, foreign exchange differences are taken directly to a foreign currency translation reserve. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until disposal of the net investment in the foreign operation at which point the related differences are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the overall gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Share capital and dividends Notes 29 and 11\n\n## Treasury Shares and own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares acquired by the Parent Company through the share buyback programme (Treasury Shares) or purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Parent Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plans and the Restricted Share Plan (own shares) are deducted from equity and presented on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Parent Company's Ordinary Shares. A financial liability is recorded if a contractual obligation to repurchase shares exists at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Parent Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.\n\n## Other Reserves\n\nOther Reserves primarily comprise reserves relating to the Group's share-based payments expense.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency'). The Consolidated Financial Statements are\n\npresented in US Dollar, which is the presentation currency of the Group. The functional currency of the Parent Company is euro.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement with the exception of all monetary items that provide an effective hedge for a net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nResults and cash flows of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates with non-US Dollar functional currencies have been translated into US Dollar at average exchange rates for the year, and the related balance sheets have been translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Adjustments arising on translation of the results and net assets of non-US Dollar subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and joint operations are recognised in a separate translation reserve within equity, net of differences on related currency borrowings. All other translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign operation are regarded as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated accordingly.\n\n153",

It manufactures and supplies a range of integrated building materials, products and innovative solutions which can be found throughout the built environment, from major public infrastructure projects to commercial buildings and homes.\n\nThe Group has three operating segments (as identified under IFRS 8 Operating Segments ) generating revenue through the following activities:\n\nAmericas Materials businesses in the US and Canada utilise an extensive network of reserve backed quarry locations, to provide asphalt paving services and to produce and supply a range of materials including cement, aggregates, readymixed concrete and asphalt. These materials are used widely in a variety of construction projects including public infrastructure, commercial buildings and homes. This segment also includes the Group's cement operations in Brazil, which were divested in April 2021.\n\nEurope Materials businesses are predominantly engaged in the manufacture and supply of cement, lime, aggregates, asphalt, readymixed\n\nconcrete and concrete products, as well as paving and construction services. Our materials are used extensively in a wide range of construction applications, from major public road and infrastructure projects, to the development and refurbishment of commercial buildings and homes. This segment comprises businesses operating in 20 countries across Western, Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Philippines in Asia.\n\nOur Building Products segment includes businesses operating across a portfolio of building product related platforms including architectural products, infrastructure products, construction accessories and building envelope. Our businesses offer a diverse range of products including brickwork supports that keep walls standing, glazing systems that hold glass in place, products that collect, connect and protect vital utility infrastructure and pavers, blocks and patio products used to pave our city centres and create unique outdoor living spaces. This segment comprises businesses operating in 19 countries primarily in the US, Canada and Western Europe. It also included up to their disposal in 2019, our perimeter protection and shutters & awnings businesses.\n\nThe divestment of our Europe Distribution business (excluding DIY Benelux), formerly part of the Building Products segment, was completed in 2019. As a result, it was classified as discontinued operations in 2019.\n\n## A. Disaggregated revenue\n\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographic market and by principal activities and products. Due to the diversified nature of the Group, the basis on which management reviews its businesses varies across the Group. Geography is the primary basis for the Americas Materials and Europe Materials businesses; while activities and products are used for the Building Products businesses.\n\nRevenue from external customers (as defined in IFRS 8) attributable to the country of domicile and all foreign countries of operation greater than 10% are included below. Further operating segment disclosures are set out in note 2.\n\nYear ended 31 December\n\n| Primary geographic markets                | Americas   Materials   2021   $m   | Europe   Materials   2021   $m   | Building   Products   2021   $m   | Total   2021     $m   | Americas   Materials   2020   $m   | Europe   Materials   2020   $m   | Building   Products   2020   $m   | Total   2020     $m   | Americas   Materials   2019   $m   | Europe   Materials   2019   $m   | Building   Products   2019   $m   | Total   2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Continuing operations                     |                                    |                                  |                                   |                       |                                    |                                  |                                   |                       |                                    |                                  |                                   |                |\n| Republic of Ireland (country of domicile) | -

The individual entities within the Group have a large number of customers spread across various activities, end-uses and geographies.\n\nRevenue derived through the supply of services and intersegment revenue are not material to the Group. The transfer pricing policy implemented by the Group between operating segments and across its constituent entities is described in note 32. In addition, due to the nature of building materials, which have a low value-to-weight ratio, the Group's revenue streams include a low level of cross-border transactions.\n\n## B. Contract balances\n\nFor information on the Group's construction contract balances, including movements during the year, refer to notes 16, 17 and 18. Movements in our net contract balances are not considered significant and are primarily driven by the timing of billing work-in-progress within our construction contract businesses.\n\n## C. Unsatisfied long-term construction contracts and other performance obligations\n\nRevenue yet to be recognised from fixed-price longterm construction contracts, primarily within our Americas Materials and Europe Materials businesses, amounted to $3,177 million at\n\n31 December 2021 (2020: $2,604 million; 2019: $2,097 million). The Group has applied the practical expedient of IFRS 15 whereby revenue yet to be recognised on contracts that had an original expected duration of less than one year is not disclosed. The majority of open contracts at 31 December 2021 will close and revenue will be recognised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.",

The segments reflect the Group's organisational structure and the nature of the financial information reported to and assessed by the Group Chief Executive and Finance Director, who are together determined to fulfil the role of Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8). No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable segments.\n\nThe principal factors employed in the identification of the three segments reflected in this note include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's organisational structure in 2021 (during 2021 each divisional President fulfilled the role of 'segment manager' as outlined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the nature of the reporting lines to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the structure of internal reporting documentation such as management accounts and budgets; and\n- \u00b7 the degree of homogeneity of products and services within each of the segments from which revenue is derived\n\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the operating results of segments separately in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Segment performance is evaluated using EBITDA (as defined)*. Given that net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purposes of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker and are accordingly omitted from the detailed segmental analysis below. There are no asymmetrical allocations to reporting segments which would require disclosure.\n\n## A.

Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\n\nNo businesses divested in 2021 or 2020 are considered to be either separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operation and therefore do not constitute discontinued operations.\n\nNo businesses met the IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations held for sale criteria at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn February 2022, the Group reached agreement to divest of its Building Envelope business for an enterprise value of $3.8 billion.

The recoverable amount of 22 CGUs is determined based on a value-in-use computation, using Level 3 inputs in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are primarily based on a five-year strategic plan document formally approved by the Board of Directors and specifically exclude the impact of future development activity. To align with the Group's acquisition modelling methodology, these cash flows are projected forward for an additional five years to determine the basis for an annuity-based terminal value. As in prior years, the terminal value is based on a 20-year annuity, with the exception of certain longlived cement assets, where an assumption of a 30-year annuity has been used. Projected cash\n\n## Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe cash flows have been arrived at taking into account the Group's strong financial position, its established history of earnings and cash flow generation and the nature of the building materials industry, where product obsolescence is very low. However, expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and are therefore liable to\n\nmaterial change over time. The key assumptions employed in arriving at the estimates of future cash flows factored into impairment testing are subjective and include projected EBITDA (as defined)* margins, long-term growth and discount rates used and the duration of the discounted cash flow model.\n\nSignificant under-performance in any of CRH's major CGUs may give rise to a material writedown of goodwill which would have a substantial impact on the Group's income and equity, however given the excess headroom on the models the likelihood of this happening is not considered reasonably possible.\n\nflows beyond the initial evaluation period have been extrapolated using real growth rates ranging from 1.8% in the Americas, 0.8% to 2.1% in Europe and 3.1% in Asia. Such real growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the countries in which each CGU operates. The value-in-use represents the present value of the future cash flows, including the terminal value, discounted at a rate appropriate to each CGU. The real pre-tax discount rates used range from 6.5% to 8.6% (2020: 6.5% to 8.6%). These rates are in line with the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, arrived at using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Net cash flows incorporate estimated capital expenditure required to achieve the Group's 2025 carbon emissions target of 520kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious material.\n\nThe 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing process has resulted in no intangible asset impairments. The 2020 annual impairment testing process resulted in an impairment of $410 million being recorded in respect of our UK CGU in Europe Materials due to a sustained period of economic disruption following the Brexit referendum in 2016, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the political uncertainty that presented in the second half of 2020 prior to the end of the Brexit transition period between the UK and the European Union. The assumptions underlying the 2020 value-in-use model projections resulted in a present value (using a real pre-tax discount rate of 7.6%) of $1,782 million and a related goodwill impairment being recorded of $410 million.\n\nliabilities, deferred tax and goodwill have been assigned to the CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis.\n\n175",

The key assumptions, methodology used and values applied to each of the key assumptions for this CGU are in line with those outlined above (a 30-year annuity period has been used). The CGU\n\nhad goodwill of $565 million at the date of testing. The table below identifies the amounts by which each of the following assumptions may either decline or increase to arrive at a zero excess of the present value of future cash flows over the book value of net assets in the CGU selected for sensitivity analysis disclosures:\n\nReduction in EBITDA (as defined)* margin Reduction in long-term growth rate Increase in pre-tax discount rate\n\nThe average EBITDA (as defined)* margin for this CGU over the initial five-year period was 21.5%.

Given the magnitude of the excess of value-in-use over carrying amount, and our belief that the key assumptions are reasonable, management believes that it is not\n\nreasonably possible that there would be a change in the key assumptions such that the carrying amount would exceed the value-in-use. Consequently no further disclosures relating to sensitivity of the value-in-use computations for the Americas Cement, AMAT South or Building Products CGUs are considered to be warranted.",

Customer credit quality is assessed in line with strict credit rating criteria and credit limits are established where appropriate. Outstanding customer balances are regularly monitored for evidence of customer financial difficulties including payment default, breach of contract etc. Significant balances are reviewed individually while smaller balances are grouped and assessed collectively. Receivables balances are in general unsecured and non-interest-bearing. Customer credit risk arising in the context of the Group's receivables is not significant and the total expected credit loss allowance for impairment of trade receivables and construction contract assets amounts to 3.2% of the Group's gross trade receivables and construction contract assets (2020: 3.8%). The Group considers the ageing of\n\npast due receivables a key factor in assessing credit risk. The trade receivables and construction contract assets balances disclosed above comprise a large number of customers spread across the Group's activities and geographies with balances classified as 'not past due' representing 68% of the total gross trade receivables and construction contract assets balance at the balance sheet date (2020: 66%). There have been no significant changes to the Group's credit risk parameters or to the composition of the Group's trade receivables and construction contract assets portfolio during the financial year.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses (ECL) permitted by IFRS 9 which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Receivables such\n\nas those which relate to bonded government contracts and receivables which fall under credit insurance are considered lower risk and would not attract a material ECL. Given the positive economic outlook (e.g. forecast Gross Domestic Product) for the next 12 months in the majority of the economies in which we operate we consider that our ECL adequately represents the risk of default on our receivable balances.\n\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Aged analysis\n\nThe aged analysis of net trade receivables and construction contract assets at the balance sheet date was as follows:\n\n$m\n\n904\n\n156\n\n71\n\n|                                             | Americas   Materials   2021   $m   | Europe   Materials   2021   $m   | Building   Products   2021   $m   | Total   2021   $m   | Americas   Materials   2020   $m   | Europe   Materials   2020   $m   | Building   Products   2020   $m   | Total   2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Not past due                                | 1,139                              | 1,050                            | 626                               | 2,815               | 956                                | 958                              | 523                               | 2,437          |\n| Past due:                                   |                                    |                                  |                                   |                     |                                    |                                  |                                   |                |\n| - less than 60 days                         | 469                                | 223                              | 227                               | 919                 | 396                                | 310                              | 198                               |                |\n| - 60 days or greater but less than 120 days | 74                                 | 44                               | 74                                | 192                 | 65                                 | 32                               | 59                                |                |\n| - 120 days or greater                       | 26                                 | 31                               | 37                                | 94                  | 24                                 | 20                               | 27                                |                |\n| Total trade receivables, net                | 1,708                              | 1,348                            | 964                               | 4,020               | 1,441                              | 1,320                            | 807                               | 3,568          |\n\nTrade receivables and construction contract assets are in general receivable within 90 days of the balance sheet date.\n\n179",

Capital and Financial Risk Management\n\n## Capital management\n\n## Overall summary\n\nThe primary objectives of CRH's capital management strategy are to ensure that the Group maintains a strong credit rating to support its business and to create shareholder value by managing the debt and equity balance and the cost of capital. The Group is committed to optimising the use of its balance sheet within the confines of the overall objective to maintain an investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group, which comprises net debt and capital and reserves attributable to the Company's equity holders, may be summarised as follows:\n\n2020\n\n$m\n\n|                                                                     | 2021   $m   |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|\n| Capital and reserves attributable   to the Company's equity holders | 20,233      | 19,656 |\n| Net debt                                                            | 6,253       | 5,941  |\n| Capital and net debt                                                | 26,486      | 25,597 |\n\nThe Board periodically reviews the capital structure of the Group, including the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group manages and, if necessary, adjusts its capital structure taking account of underlying economic conditions; any material adjustments to the Group's capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity are approved by the Board. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, dispose of assets, amend investment plans, alter dividend policy or return capital to shareholders.\n\nDividend cover for the year ended 31 December 2021 amounted to 2.7x (2020: 1.2x).\n\nNo changes were made in the objectives or policies during 2021.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group uses financial instruments throughout its businesses: interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and leases are used to finance the Group's operations; trade receivables and trade payables arise directly from operations; and derivatives, principally interest rate and currency swaps and currency forwards, are used to manage interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of borrowings.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority's announcement on 5 March 2021, LIBOR benchmark rates were discontinued after 31 December 2021 except for the majority of the US dollar settings which will be discontinued after 30 June 2023. Those rates that were discontinued were replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of the inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform.\n\nThe Group prepared an action plan, encompassing treasury, legal, accounting and IT functions, to enable a smooth transition to the alternative benchmark rates. The review identified a range of contracts that reference IBORs, including credit facilities, derivative instruments, money market deposits, lease agreements, and supply contract agreements. Action plans were developed for each of these arrangements to ensure a smooth transition to ARR. None of the changes had an impact on the Group's financing or interest rate hedging strategies, nor did they have a material financial impact.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is $1.4 billion. While the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) benchmark rate has been widely adopted by market participants and effectively replaced US LIBOR in new contracts since 31 December 2021, a number of US LIBOR settings, including 3-month and 6-month US LIBOR, will continue to be published until 30 June 2023. Accordingly, absent any agreement with counterparties to transition to an ARR before this date, the Group's existing USD denominated interest rate swaps with maturity dates beyond 30 June 2023 will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases. As at 31 December 2021, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing USD denominated interest rate swaps to ARRs. The Group's other interest rate swaps reference EURIBOR rates and thus are not impacted by the IBOR reforms.\n\nThe Group does not trade in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.\n\nThe Group's corporate treasury function provides services to the business units, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. The Group Treasurer reports to the Director of Group Finance and the activities of the corporate treasury function are subject to regular internal audit. Systems and processes are in place to monitor and control the Group's liquidity risks. The Group's net debt position forms part of the monthly documentation presented to the Board.\n\nThe Group's hedging activity is based on observable economic relationships, when there is confidence that such relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Matching critical terms such as notional amount, tenor, timing and currency, the Group establishes relationships between a hedge item and hedge instrument where directional response to changes in fair value, driven by underlying economic conditions, are opposing and proportional in equal measure being an economic relationship under IFRS 9. Hedging ratios of 1:1 are used throughout all hedging activity as the hedge item and hedge instrument are of the same type\n\nand currency. The hedges employed mitigate identified risks and have consistently demonstrated close economic relationships. Ineffectiveness between the hedge item and hedge instrument are immaterial in the overall context of the Group.\n\nThe main risks attaching to the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for the prudent management of each of these risks as documented below.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates stems predominantly from its longterm debt obligations. Interest cost is managed using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. With the objective of managing this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, under which the Group contracts to exchange, at predetermined intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a pre-agreed notional principal. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures of issued floating rate debt.\n\nThese swaps are designated under IFRS 9 to hedge underlying debt obligations and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The Group issues fixed rate debt and may enter into interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt.\n\n189",

Capital and Financial Risk Management - continued\n\nThe following table demonstrates the impact on profit before tax of a range of possible changes in the interest rates applicable to net floating rate borrowings, with all other variables held constant. These impacts are calculated based on the closing balance sheet floating rate net debt for a full year and assume that all floating interest rates change by the same amount.\n\n| Percentage change in cost of   borrowings (i)   |   +/- 1% | +/- 1%   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Impact on profit before tax                     |     2021 | +/- $38m |\n|                                                 |     2020 | +/- $59m |\n|                                                 |     2019 | +/- $23m |\n\n- (i) Sensitivity analysis for cost of borrowing has been presented for continuing operations only.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nDue to the nature of building materials, which in general have a low value-to-weight ratio, the Group's activities are conducted primarily in the local currency of the country of operation resulting in low levels of foreign currency transaction risk; variances arising in this regard are reflected in operating costs or cost of sales in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nGiven the Group's presence in 28 countries worldwide, the principal foreign exchange risk arises from fluctuations in the US Dollar value of the Group's net investment in a wide basket of currencies other than the US Dollar; such changes are reported separately within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. A currency profile of the Group's net debt and net worth is presented in note 21. The Group's established policy is to spread its net worth across the currencies of its various operations with the objective of limiting its exposure to individual currencies and thus promoting consistency with the geographical balance of its operations. In order to achieve this objective, the Group manages its borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to act as a natural foreign currency hedge of a portion of its foreign currency assets.\n\nThe Group's foreign exchange hedging strategy and activity is based on the assumption that changes in international economic factors are reflected in current foreign exchange rates and\n\nimpacts the translation of the Group's non-euro net assets (euro being the functional currency of the ultimate parent company). The economic relationship, being the translation impact of the Group's net investment in non-euro subsidiaries (hedge item) is hedged against a foreign currency swap (hedge instrument) to counterbalance movements in foreign currency rates. The Group identifies certain portions of foreign currency net investments where foreign currency translation movements can be mitigated through the use of currency swaps in the same currency pairing. A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. As at 31 December 2021, the notional amount of hedged net investments was $726 million (2020: $1,028 million). The primary currency pairs in use are euro versus Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling, Romanian Leu, Polish Zloty and Danish Kroner. The fair value movements of the hedge instruments are inverse to the impact of the translation of the hedged net assets because the critical terms match. This reduces the Group's exposure to fluctuations on the translation of the Group's subsidiaries with a non-euro functional currency into euro. Potential sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the interest rate differentials of the hedged currency pairs, recorded through the Consolidated Income Statement. Past trends indicate that the economic relationship described will continue for the foreseeable future. The fair values and maturity analysis of the hedge instruments are set out in note 25. Undesignated financial instruments are termed 'not designated as hedges'.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax and equity to selected movements in the relevant US Dollar/euro exchange rate (with all other variables held constant); the euro has been selected as the appropriate currency for this analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. The impact on profit before tax is based on changing the US Dollar/euro exchange rate used in calculating profit before tax for the period. The impact on total equity and financial instruments is calculated by changing the US Dollar/euro exchange rate used in measuring the closing balance sheet.\n\n| Percentage change in relevant   $/ \u20ac  exchange rate (i)                | +/- 5%          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Impact on profit before tax                                            | 2021   -/+ $22m |\n|                                                                        | 2020   -/+ $19m |\n|                                                                        | 2019   +/- $4m  |\n| Impact on total equity*                                                | 2021   +/-$123m |\n|                                                                        | 2020   +/-$157m |\n|                                                                        | 2019   +/-$177m |\n| *  Includes the impact on financial   instruments which is as follows: | 2021   -/+ $44m |\n|                                                                        | 2020   -/+ $27m |\n|                                                                        | 2019   -/+ $11m |\n\n- (i) Sensitivity analysis for exchange rates has been presented for continuing operations only.\n\nFinancial instruments include deposits, money market funds, commercial papers, bank loans, medium-term notes and other fixed term debt, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. They exclude trade receivables and trade payables on the basis that they are denominated in the currency of the underlying operations. The Group minimises the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group's income statement through matching where possible, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities or the use of derivative contracts at an entity level.\n\n## Credit/counterparty risk\n\nIn addition to cash at bank and in hand, the Group holds significant cash balances which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified as cash equivalents (see note 23). These deposits, investments and other financial instruments (principally certain derivatives and loans and receivables included within financial assets) give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparty financial institutions (stemming from their insolvency or a downgrade in their credit ratings). Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty primarily depending on its credit rating and by regular review of these ratings and internal treasury policies.",

The Group limits its investment in each fund to a prescribed maximum amount or 5% of the fund's assets under management, whichever is the lower. The Group has a number of managed investment funds that hold fixed income euro securities with an average credit quality of Aaa/ AAA. As at 31 December 2021, 65% (2020: 88%) of cash and cash equivalents was held with higher investment grade bank counterparties, and 35% (2020: 12%) with the money market funds.\n\nCredit risk arising in the context of the Group's operations is not significant with the total loss allowance at the balance sheet date amounting to 3.2% of gross trade receivables and construction contract assets (2020: 3.8%). Information in relation to the Group's credit risk management of trade receivables is provided in note 17. Amounts receivable from related parties (notes 17 and 32) are immaterial. Factoring arrangements and supplier financing arrangements are employed in certain of the Group's operations where deemed to be of benefit by operational management and are deemed immaterial.\n\nIn its worldwide insurance programme, the Group carries appropriate levels of insurance for typical business risks (including product liability) with various leading insurance companies. However, in the event of the failure of one or more of its insurance counterparties, the Group could be\n\nimpacted by losses where recovery from such counterparties is not possible.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe principal liquidity risks faced by the Group stem from the maturation of debt obligations and derivative transactions. A downgrade of CRH's credit ratings may give rise to increases in funding costs in respect of future debt and may impair the Group's ability to raise funds on acceptable terms. The Group's corporate treasury function ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet such liabilities as they fall due through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows and undrawn committed bank facilities. Flexibility in funding sources is achieved through a variety of means including (i) maintaining cash and cash equivalents only with a diverse group of highlyrated counterparties; (ii) limiting the annual maturity of such balances; (iii) borrowing the bulk of the Group's debt requirements under committed bank lines or other term financing; and (iv) having surplus committed lines of credit.\n\nThe undrawn committed facilities available to the Group as at the balance sheet date are quantified in note 24; these facilities span a wide number of highly-rated financial institutions thus minimising any potential exposure arising from concentrations in borrowing sources. The repayment schedule (analysed by maturity date) applicable to the Group's outstanding interest-bearing loans and borrowings as at the balance sheet date is also presented in note 24.\n\nThe Group's \u20ac 1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme and $2.0 billion US Dollar Commercial Paper Programme means we have framework programmes in the money markets in place that allow the Group to issue in the relevant markets within a short period of time.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe principal commodity price risks are identified in a variety of highly probable and active commodity contracts where a significant part of the price to be paid relies on a reference to specific floating price indices (usually US Dollar) for a specific period. Programmes are in place to hedge the quantities and qualities of commodity products, including fuel oil and related products, electricity and carbon credits. The aim of the programmes is to neutralise the variability in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of changes in associated commodity indices over a timeframe of approximately four years (2020: five years). A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. Fixed price swap contracts in the entity's operating currency are used to hedge the same specific floating index risk and currency risk where it is determined that those risks are better managed at a fixed price rather than being exposed to uncontrollable price fluctuations due to the floating price index element of the contract. Sources of ineffectiveness can relate to timing of cash flows and counterparty credit risk adjustments. The derivative contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and the fair values by maturity are set out in note 25.\n\nThe notional and fair values in respect of derivative contracts as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 were as follows:\n\n## Profile of commodity products\n\n$m\n\n-\n\n(2)\n\n|                              | As at 31 December 2021   | As at 31 December 2021   | As at 31 December 2020   | As at 31 December 2020   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                              | Notional value   $m      | Fair value   $m          | Notional value   $m      | Fair value               |\n| Commodity swaps              | 86                       | -                        | 85                       |                          |\n| Derivative asset/(liability) | -                        | 32                       | -                        |                          |\n\n191",

The credit risk attaching to these items is documented in note 22.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at amortised cost and are analysed as follows:\n\n2020\n\n$m\n\n|                                   | 2021   $m   |       |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand          | 925         | 1,482 |\n| Investments (short-term deposits) | 4,858       | 6,239 |\n| Total                             | 5,783       | 7,721 |\n\nCash at bank earns/pays interest at floating rates based on daily deposit bank rates. Short-term deposits, which include bank and money market deposits, are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, earning interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\nMoney market deposits are held at fair value through profit and loss and are Level 1 instruments. The fair values of money market deposits are calculated by multiplying the net asset value per share by the investment held at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 24.

Revolving committed bank facilities are generally available to the Group for periods of up to five years from the date of inception. The undrawn committed facilities figures shown in the table above represent the facilities available to be drawn by the Group at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Group successfully carried out an amendment of its \u20ac 3.5 billion revolving credit facility in March 2021 whereby the Group extended the maturity date of the facility for a further year to 2026. In January 2021 the Group repaid a $400 million bond upon maturity and in April 2021 a \u20ac 600 million bond was repaid early when a 3-month par-call option was exercised.\n\nAt the end of 2021 a number of LIBOR settings ceased to be published (including Sterling and\n\nSwiss Franc), while certain US Dollar LIBOR settings will continue to be provided until June 2023. There is no change to the publication of EURIBOR rates. The Group's syndicated revolving credit facility (undrawn as at 31 December 2021) previously referenced USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR rates. During 2021 the Group negotiated with its Lenders amendments to the facility to include market standard LIBOR replacement language. From 1 January 2022 the agreement will adopt the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON) as the alternative benchmark rates in respect of USD, GBP and CHF LIBOR rates respectively.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Company has given letters of guarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings as\n\nfollows: $10.0 billion in respect of loans and borrowings, bank advances and derivative obligations (2020: $11.6 billion) and $0.4 billion in respect of letters of credit (2020: $0.4 billion).\n\nAny Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company may avail of the exemption from filing its statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 as permitted by section 357 of the Companies Act 2014 and if an Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company elects to avail of this exemption, there will be in force an irrevocable guarantee from the Company in respect of all commitments entered into by such whollyowned subsidiary, including amounts shown as liabilities (within the meaning of section 357 (1) (b) of the Companies Act 2014) in such wholly-owned subsidiary's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n193",

The amount of tax losses where recovery is not probable and is therefore not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is $1.2 billion (2020: $1.4 billion). The vast majority either do not expire based on current tax legislation or they expire post 2026 (2020: 2025). Of the losses not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, $0.1 billion (2020: $0.1 billion) expire within five years, $0.4 billion (2020: $0.3 billion) expire post five years and the remainder of losses do not expire.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities (taxable temporary differences)\n\nTaxable temporary differences principally attributable to accelerated tax depreciation and fair value\n\n| adjustments arising on acquisition (i)                        | 3,218   | 3,123   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Leased right-of-use assets                                    | 314     |         |\n| Investment in subsidiaries                                    | 164     |         |\n| Surpluses on Group retirement benefit schemes                 | 9       |         |\n| Revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value | 15      |         |\n| Rolled-over capital gains                                     | 22      |         |\n| Total                                                         | 3,742   | 3,628   |\n\n315\n\n161\n\n-\n\n12\n\n17\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe aggregate temporary differences in relation to investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is $12.1 billion (2020: $10.9 billion) given the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal and management's intention not to unwind these temporary differences. Participation exemptions and tax credits are available in the majority of jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

The disclosures included below relate to all pension schemes in the Group.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The Group also operated a defined benefit pension scheme in Brazil which was divested in April 2021. The Group has a mixture of funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes. The net surplus of the funded schemes is $54 million (2020: net liability of $154 million net of surpluses of $111 million). Unfunded obligations (including jubilee, post-retirement healthcare obligations and long-term service commitments) comprise of a number of schemes in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US, totalling a net liability of $363 million (2020: $402 million).\n\nFunded defined benefit schemes in the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and the UK are administered by separate funds that are legally distinct from the Group under the jurisdiction of Trustees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the scheme participants and are responsible for the definition of investment strategy and for scheme administration. Other schemes are also administered in line with the local regulatory environment. The level of benefits available to most members depends on length of service and either their average salary over their period of employment or their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. For Switzerland, the level of benefits depends on salary, level of\n\nsavings contributions, the interest rate on old age accounts (which cannot be negative) and the annuity conversion factor on retirement. The Group's pension schemes in Switzerland are contribution-based schemes with guarantees to provide further contributions in the event that the plan assets are insufficient to meet the benefit obligations.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes - principal risks\n\nThrough its defined benefit pension and jubilee schemes, long-term service commitments and post-retirement healthcare plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\nAsset volatility: Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits , the assets of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are reported at fair value (using bid prices, where relevant). The majority of the schemes' assets comprise equities, bonds and property, all of which may fluctuate significantly in value from period to period including from fluctuations arising in respect of climate change and associated risks and uncertainties. Given that liabilities are discounted to present value based on bond yields and that bond prices are inversely related to yields, an increase in the liability discount rate (which would reduce liabilities) would reduce bond values, though not necessarily by an equal magnitude.\n\nGiven the maturity of certain of the Group's funded defined benefit pension schemes, de-risking frameworks have been introduced to mitigate deficit volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows related to benefit obligations. These\n\nframeworks entail the usage of asset-liability matching techniques, whereby triggers are set for the conversion of equity holdings into bonds of similar average duration to the relevant liabilities.\n\nDiscount rates: The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum of liabilities as discussed above.\n\nInflation risk: A significant amount of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the schemes against extreme inflation).\n\nLongevity risk: In the majority of cases, the Group's defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits for life with spousal and dependent child reversionary provisions; increases in life expectancy (decreases in mortality assumptions) will therefore give rise to higher liabilities.\n\n## Aggregation\n\nFor the purposes of the disclosures which follow; the schemes in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Slovakia have been aggregated into a 'Eurozone' category on the basis of common currency and financial assumptions; schemes in Brazil, the Philippines, Romania, Serbia and the UK have been aggregated into an 'Other' category.\n\n## Financial assumptions-scheme liabilities\n\nThe major long-term assumptions used by the Group's actuaries in the computation of scheme liabilities and post-retirement healthcare obligations are as follows:\n\n%\n\n1.50\n\n-\n\n1.00\n\n0.30\n\nn/a\n\n|                         |      |      |      | United States   and Canada   | United States   and Canada   | United States   and Canada   |      |      |      |\n|-------------------------|------|------|------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------|------|------|\n|                         | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 | 2021                         | 2020                         | 2019                         | 2021 | 2020 | 2019 |\n|                         | %    | %    | %    | %                            | %                            | %                            | %    | %    |      |\n| Rate of increase in:    |      |      |      |                              |                              |                              |      |      |      |\n| - salaries              | 2.92 | 2.52 | 3.37 | 3.03                         | 3.37                         | 3.37                         | 1.25 | 1.00 |      |\n| - pensions in payment   | 1.90 | 1.45 | 1.46 | -                            | -                            | -                            | -    | -    |      |\n| Inflation               | 1.90 | 1.50 | 1.50 | 2.00                         | 2.00                         | 2.00                         | 0.75 | 0.50 |      |\n| Discount rate           | 1.43 | 1.14 | 1.43 | 2.82                         | 2.34                         | 3.14                         | 0.30 | 0.20 |      |\n| Medical cost trend rate | n/a  | n/a  | n/a  | 5.91                         | 5.97                         | 5.18                         | n/a  | n/a  |      |",

Business Combinations - continued\n\nThe acquisition balance sheet presented on the previous page reflects the identifiable net assets acquired in respect of acquisitions completed during 2021, together with adjustments to provisional fair values in respect of acquisitions completed during 2020. The measurement period for a number of acquisitions completed in 2020, closed in 2021 with no material adjustments identified.\n\nCRH performs a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 Business Combinations . None of the acquisitions completed during the year were considered sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure of the attributable fair values. The initial assignment of the fair values to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as disclosed are provisional (principally in respect of property, plant and equipment) in respect of certain acquisitions due to timing of close. The fair value assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. CRH may revise its purchase price allocation during the subsequent reporting window as permitted under IFRS 3.\n\n- (i) The gross contractual value of trade and other receivables as at the respective dates of acquisition amounted to $192 million (2020: $47 million; 2019: $74 million). The fair value of these receivables is $191 million (all of which is expected to be recoverable) (2020: $47 million; 2019: $73 million).\n- (ii) The principal factor contributing to the recognition of goodwill on acquisitions entered into by the Group is the realisation of cost savings and other synergies with existing entities in the Group which do not qualify for separate recognition as intangible assets. Due to the asset-intensive nature of operations in the Americas Materials and Europe Materials business segments, no significant separately identifiable intangible assets are recognised on business combinations in these segments. $284 million of the goodwill recognised in respect of acquisitions completed in 2021 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes (2020: $148 million; 2019: $184 million).\n\nAcquisition-related costs for continuing operations, which exclude post-acquisition integration costs, amounting to $14 million (2020: $6 million; 2019: $7 million) have been included in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement (note 4).\n\nThe following table analyses the 20 acquisitions completed in 2021 (2020: 17 acquisitions; 2019: 58 acquisitions) by reportable segment and provides details of the goodwill and consideration figures arising in each of those segments:\n\nNumber of\n\n|                                                                   | acquisitions   | acquisitions   | acquisitions   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   | Goodwill   | Consideration   | Consideration   | Consideration   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Reportable segments                                               | 2021           | 2020           | 2019           | 2021       | 2020       | 2019       | 2021            | 2020            | 2019            |\n| Continuing operations                                             |                |                |                | $m         | $m         | $m         | $m              | $m              |                 |\n| Americas Materials                                                | 8              | 7              | 27             | 239        | 53         | 35         | 694             | 163             |                 |\n| Europe Materials                                                  | 4              | 4              | 15             | 1          | -          | 4          | 17              | 7               |                 |\n| Building Products                                                 | 8              | 6              | 15             | 434        | 90         | 253        | 790             | 182             |                 |\n| Total Group from continuing operations                            | 20             | 17             | 57             | 674        | 143        | 292        | 1,501           | 352             |                 |\n| Discontinued operations                                           |                |                |                |            |            |            |                 |                 |                 |\n| Europe Distribution                                               | -              | -              | 1              | -          | -          | -          | -               | -               |                 |\n| Total Group                                                       | 20             | 17             | 58             | 674        | 143        | 292        | 1,501           | 352             |                 |\n| Adjustments to provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions |                |                |                | 5          | 14         | 18         | 1               | 6               |                 |\n| Total                                                             |                |                |                | 679        | 157        | 310        | 1,502           | 358             |                 |\n\nThe post-acquisition impact of acquisitions completed during the year on the Group's profit for the financial year was as follows:\n\n2019\n\n$m\n\n228\n\n2\n\n| Continuing operations                    |   2021   $m |   2020   $m |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Revenue                                  |         568 |         103 |\n| Profit before tax for the financial year |          51 |           9 |\n\n$m\n\n182\n\n71\n\n501\n\n754\n\n4\n\n758\n\n-\n\n758",

Related Party Transactions\n\nThe principal related party relationships requiring disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures pertain to: the existence of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates; transactions with these entities entered into by the Group; the identification and compensation of key management personnel; and lease arrangements.\n\n## Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Company (CRH plc, the ultimate parent) and its subsidiaries as well as its joint ventures and associates accounted for by applying the equity method as outlined in the accounting policies on pages 145 to 154. The Group's principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are disclosed on pages 260 to 264.\n\nSales to and purchases from joint ventures and associates are as follows:\n\n$m\n\n41\n\n18\n\n|                       | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associates   | Associates   | Associates   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                       | 2021             | 2020             | 2019             | 2021         | 2020         | 2019         |\n| Continuing operations | $m               | $m               | $m               | $m           | $m           |              |\n| Sales                 | 157              | 127              | 132              | 42           | 31           |              |\n| Purchases             | 29               | 24               | 27               | 19           | 15           |              |\n\nLoans extended by the Group to joint ventures and associates (see note 15) are included in financial assets. Amounts receivable from and payable to equity accounted investments (arising from the aforementioned sales and purchases transactions) as at the balance sheet date are included as separate line items in notes 17 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Terms and conditions of transactions with subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nIn general, the transfer pricing policy implemented by the Group across its subsidiaries is market-based.

Basis of Preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2014 and GAAP in the Republic of Ireland (Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101)). Note 2 below describes the principal accounting policies under FRS 101, which have been applied consistently.\n\nIn these financial statements the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:\n\n- \u00b7 Statement of Cash Flows;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements ;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures ;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ; and\n- \u00b7 The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs\n\n## 2. Accounting Policies\n\n## General information\n\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (together the 'Group') is the leading building materials business in the world. It manufactures and supplies a range of building materials, products and innovative solutions which can be found throughout the built environment in a wide range of construction projects from major public infrastructure to commercial buildings and homes. The Company is a public limited company whose shares are publicly traded. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Ireland. The Company's registered number is 12965 and registered office address is 42 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.\n\n## Key accounting policies which involve estimates, assumptions and judgements\n\nPreparation of the financial statements requires management to make significant judgements and estimates. The items in the financial statements where these judgements and estimates have been made include:\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment and are reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessment is considered as part of the Group's overall impairment assessment.\n\n## Loans receivable and payable\n\nIntercompany loans receivable and payable are initially recognised at fair value. These are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any loss allowance.\n\n## Other significant accounting policies\n\n## Operating income and expense\n\nOperating income and expense arises from the Company's principal activities as a holding and financing company for the Group and are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of the Company is euro. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the profit and loss account.\n\nThe presentation currency of the Company is the US Dollar.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Company has applied the requirements of Section 8 of FRS 101.\n\nThe accounting policy applicable to share-based payments is addressed in detail on page 149 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Treasury Shares and own shares\n\n## Treasury Shares\n\nOwn equity instruments (i.e. Ordinary Shares) acquired by the Company are deducted from equity\n\nand presented on the face of the Company Balance Sheet. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's Ordinary Shares. A financial liability is recorded if a contractual obligation to repurchase shares exists at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plan are recorded as a deduction from equity on the face of the Company Balance Sheet.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Company's Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Bank overdrafts are included within creditors falling due within one year in the Company Balance Sheet.",

Section 357 Guarantees\n\nAny Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company may avail of the exemption from filing its statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 as permitted by Section 357 of the Companies Act 2014 and if an Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company elects to avail of this exemption, there will be in force an irrevocable guarantee from the Company in respect of all commitments entered into by such wholly-owned subsidiary, including amounts shown as liabilities (within the meaning of Section 357 (1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014) in such wholly-owned subsidiary's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nDetails in relation to other guarantees provided by the Company are provided in the interest-bearing loans and borrowings note (note 24) on page 193 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 12. Directors' Emoluments\n\nDirectors' emoluments and interests are presented in note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 80 to 109 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## 13.

EBITDA is de/fined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax and is quoted by management in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP /financial measures, to aid investors in their analysis of the performance of the Group and to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. EBITDA (as de/fined)* by segment is monitored by management in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Given that net /finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purpose of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. EBITDA (as de/fined)* margin is calculated by expressing EBITDA (as de/fined)* as a percentage of sales.\n\nNet Debt. Net debt is used by management as it gives a more complete picture of the Group's current debt situation than total interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Net debt is provided to enable investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure and comprises current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and current and non-current derivative /financial instruments (net).\n\nNet Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)* is monitored by management and is useful to investors in assessing the Company's level of indebtedness relative to its pro/fitability. It is the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as de/fined)* and is calculated on page 221.\n\nEBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover. EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover is used by management as a measure which matches the earnings and cash generated by the business to the underlying funding costs. EBITDA (as de/fined)* Net Interest Cover is presented to provide investors with a greater understanding of the impact of CRH's debt and /financing arrangements. It is the ratio of EBITDA (as de/fined)* to Net Interest and is calculated on page 221.\n\nRONA. Return on Net Assets is a key internal pre-tax and pre-non-cash impairment measure of operating performance throughout the CRH Group and can be used by management and investors to measure the relative use of assets between CRH's business segments and to compare to other businesses. The metric measures management's ability to generate pro/fits from the net assets required to support that business, focusing on both pro/fit maximisation and the maintenance of an ef/ficient asset base; it encourages effective /fixed asset maintenance programmes, good decisions regarding expenditure on property, plant and equipment and the timely disposal of surplus assets,\n\nand also supports the effective management of the Group's working capital base. RONA is calculated by expressing total Group operating pro/fit excluding non-cash impairment charges 1 as a percentage of average net assets. Net assets comprise total assets by segment (including assets held for sale) less total liabilities by segment (excluding lease liabilities and including liabilities associated with assets classi/fied as held for sale) as shown on page 220 and detailed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and excludes equity accounted investments and other /financial assets, net debt (as previously de/fined) and tax assets & liabilities. The average net assets for the year is the simple average of the opening and closing balance sheet /figures.\n\nOrganic Revenue, Organic Operating Pro/fit and Organic EBITDA (as de/fined)*. CRH pursues a strategy of growth through acquisitions and investments, with $1.5 billion spent on acquisitions and investments in 2021 (2020: $0.4 billion). Acquisitions completed in 2020 and 2021 contributed incremental sales revenue of $856 million, operating pro/fit of $52 million and EBITDA (as de/fined)* of $101/uni00A0million in 2021. Cash proceeds from divestments and non-current asset disposals amounted to $507 million (net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments (2020: $307 million).

        "page_content": "in 2021 was a negative $182 million and the impact at an operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* level was a negative $51 million and $58/uni00A0million respectively.\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies by the end of 2021. However, during 2021 the US Dollar weakened against most major currencies resulting in the average US Dollar/Euro rate weakening from 0.8771 in 2020 to 0.8460 in 2021, and likewise for US Dollar/Pound Sterling weakening from an average 0.7798 in 2020 to 0.7270 in 2021. Overall currency movements resulted in a favourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown in the table on page 39. The average and year-end 2021 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the Group are set out on page 154.\n\nBecause of the impact of acquisitions, divestments, exchange translation and other non-recurring items on reported results each year, the Group uses organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* as additional performance indicators to assess performance of pre-existing (also referred to as underlying, heritage, like-for-like or ongoing) operations each year.\n\nOrganic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* are arrived at by excluding the incremental revenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* contributions from current and prior year acquisitions and divestments, the impact of exchange translation and the impact of any non-recurring items. In the Business Performance section on pages 36 to 53, changes in organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* are presented as additional measures of revenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* to provide a greater understanding of the performance of the Group. Organic change % is calculated by expressing the organic movement as a percentage of the prior year (adjusted for exchange effects). A reconciliation of the changes in organic revenue, organic operating pro/fit and organic EBITDA (as de/fined)* to the changes in total revenue, operating pro/fit and EBITDA (as de/fined)* for the Group and by segment, is presented with the discussion of each segment's performance in tables contained in the segment discussion commencing on page 36.\n\nRevenue from continuing and discontinued operations, EBITDA (as de/fined)* from continuing and discontinued operations and Operating Pro/fit from continuing and discontinued operations. As detailed in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our Europe Distribution business has been classi/fied as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5. In certain instances throughout the Annual Report and Form 20-F we refer to revenue, EBITDA (as de/fined)* and operating pro/fit from continuing and discontinued operations. Information presented on this basis is useful to investors as (i) it provides further understanding of the Group's performance and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. A reconciliation of each of these measures is detailed on page 219.\n\nCash paid to Shareholders. Cash paid to shareholders is a measure of cash returned to shareholders representing dividends of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.7 billion) paid during the year and excess cash of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.2 billion) returned through the share buyback programme. The metric provides information on dividend growth for shareholders and is re/flective of CRH's continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. CRH monitors the cash paid to shareholders as part of its overall capital allocation strategy.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR). TSR is a measure of shareholder returns delivery through the cycle. It represents the total accumulated value delivered to shareholders since the formation of the Group in 1970 (via gross dividends reinvested and share appreciation) and is calculated on page 221. The metric provides information on total returns for shareholders and is provided to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies.\n\nPro/fit after Tax (Pre-impairment) . Pro/fit after Tax pre-impairment as calculated on page 222 is a measure of the Group's pro/fitability from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges and the related tax impact of such impairments. Pro/fit after Tax presented on a pre-impairment basis is used by management to evaluate the Group's pro/fitability in a given year and is useful to investors as it (i) provides an understanding of the Group's underlying performance and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies.\n\nEarnings per Share (Pre-impairment). Earnings per Share (EPS) pre-impairment is a measure of the Group's pro/fitability per share from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges and the related tax impact of such impairments. It is used by management to evaluate the Group's underlying pro/fitability performance relative to that of other companies and its own past performance. EPS information presented on a pre-impairment basis is useful to investors as it (i) provides an insight into the Group's underlying performance and pro/fitability and (ii) assists investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. EPS pre-impairment is calculated on page 222 as pro/fit attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Company from continuing operations excluding any non-cash impairment charges (and the related tax impact of such impairments) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the year.",

The clinker (the key intermediate product in the manufacture of cement) capacity for these locations is set out in the table below. Further details on locations and products manufactured are provided on pages 266 and 267. None of CRH's individual properties is of material signi/ficance to the Group.\n\nCRH believes that all the facilities are in good condition, adequate for their purpose and suitably utilised according to the individual nature and requirements of the relevant operations. CRH has a\n\ncontinuing programme of improvements and replacements to properties when considered appropriate to meet the needs of the individual operations. Further information in relation to the Group's accounting policy and process governing any impairment of property, plant and equipment is given on page 146 and in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 172.\n\n## Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nCRH generally owns or leases the real estate on which its main raw materials, namely aggregates, are found. CRH is a signi/ficant purchaser of certain important materials or resources such as cement, bitumen, steel, gas, fuel and other energy supplies, the cost of which can /fluctuate signi/ficantly and\n\nconsequently have an adverse impact on CRH's business. CRH is not generally dependent on any one source for the supply of these materials or resources, other than in certain jurisdictions with regard to the supply of gas and electricity. Competitive markets generally exist in the jurisdictions in which CRH operates for the supply of cement, bitumen, steel and fuel.\n\n## Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nThe information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is included in Exhibit 16 to CRH's Annual Report on Form 20-F, as /filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n## Signi/ficant Locations - Clinker Capacity\n\n| Subsidiary           | Country        |   Number of plants | Clinker capacity   (tonnes per hour)   |\n|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Ash Grove            | United States  |                 10 | 1,148                                  |\n| Republic Cement      | Philippines    |                  5 | 628                                    |\n|                      | Poland         |                  1 | 342                                    |\n| Podilsky Cement PJSC | Ukraine        |                  1 | 325                                    |\n| Tarmac               | United Kingdom |                  3 | 306                                    |\n| ROMCIM               | Romania        |                  2 | 305                                    |\n| Danucem              | Slovakia       |                  2 | 290                                    |\n| Ash Grove            | Canada         |                  2 | 288                                    |\n| Irish Cement         | Ireland        |                  2 | 288                                    |\n| Opterra              | Germany        |                  2 | 268                                    |\n| Eqiom                | France         |                  3 | 243                                    |",

        "page_content": "## Mineral Reserves and Resources\n\n## Mineral Reserves and Resources Background\n\nThe Group's mineral reserves (reserves) and mineral resources (resources) for the production of primary building materials (which encompasses aggregates (stone, sand and gravel), cement and lime, asphalt, readymixed concrete and concrete products) fall into a variety of categories spanning a wide number of rock types and geological classi/fications. These reserves and resources are found within our extensive network of quarry locations in attractive local markets globally. This disclosure of the Group's mining properties has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K ('Subpart 1300'). The Group has 1,230 properties with 91,721 hectares of owned and 37,079 hectares of leased land, respectively, as disclosed in the table on page 229, the locations of which are presented by geographic location in the maps on pages 230 to 231.\n\nNone of CRH's mineral-bearing properties are individually material to the Group as at 31 December 2021. A summary disclosure of CRH's mining operations is provided on pages 227 to 231.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group's reserves and resources estimations of 22.8 billion tonnes and 9.7 billion tonnes, respectively, as disclosed on pages 227 to 228, are calculated in accordance with Subpart 1300. The Group's reserves and resources disclosures may not be comparable to similar disclosures disclosed in accordance with the requirements of other countries and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures that follow on pages 227 to 231.\n\nCRH operates predominantly production stage properties, with a limited number of development and exploration stage properties, as such terms are de/fined in Subpart 1300. Predominantly, CRH's production stage properties provide raw materials for on-site modern cement, lime and aggregates producing facilities. Almost exclusively, CRH utilises surface mining and, with a very limited number of exceptions, CRH and its subsidiaries are the only operators of the properties.\n\n## Reserves\n\nReserves are de/fined in Subpart 1300 as 'an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the quali/fied person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More speci/fically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted'. Reserves are classi/fied into two categories, probable and proven reserves, in order of increasing geological con/fidence.\n\nThe Group's estimate of 22.8 billion tonnes of reserves, as disclosed on page 227 analysed by rock type (Hard rock, Sand & Gravel and Other), are of recoverable stone, sand, and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by the Group's geologists and engineers. These estimates also consider reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and are subject to permitting or other restrictions.\n\nThe disclosed reserves and resources estimations which include diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the mineral is mined, extracted or processed have been estimated by quali/fied persons, as such term is de/fined within Subpart 1300.\n\nNot all minerals that may be on CRH's mineralbearing properties have been assessed and such properties may be assessed for mineral reserves or resources in future years, as required by operational needs.\n\nCRH's properties are subject to a wide variety of permitting procedures and conditions, which vary between jurisdictions. Many of CRH's properties require separate permits from multiple authorities, including but not limited to environmental, mining, regional and national administrative authorities. The periods of validity and the conditions of these permits may be different.\n\n## Resources\n\nA mineral resource is de/fined in Subpart 1300 as \"a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralisation, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justi/fiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable\".\n\nResources are classi/fied into three categories, inferred, indicated or measured resources, in order of increasing geological con/fidence. Indicated or measured resources can be converted to reserves by the application of certain modifying factors which include, but are not limited to, consideration of mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental compliance, plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups, and governmental factors. There is no certainty that any of the resources disclosed on page 228 will be converted into reserves. Resources have not been fully assessed using modifying factors, however, an initial assessment has been completed in accordance with Subpart 1300.\n\n## Internal Controls\n\nCRH has established appropriate governance processes to support the publication of our 2021 reserves and resources disclosures and as outlined on page 66, the Audit Committee, as one of its key areas of focus for 2021, has reviewed and considered the new mining property disclosures. Reserve and resource estimates are subject to annual review by each of the relevant operating companies across the Group in conjunction with the relevant quali/fied persons. CRH has established and maintains a number of internal controls to address the risks inherent in the mineral reserves and resources reporting process. These internal controls have been embedded into the local control environments and operate across the business, including controls at an Operating Company, Divisional and Group level.\n\nAs CRH's reserves and resources are predominantly in production stage properties, features of the internal controls relating to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Databases and data repositories for exploration and/or production data that contain accurate and precise data from which reserves and resources can be evaluated, and operational plans can be developed;\n- \u00b7 Veri/fication sampling and testing of known mineralisation. This is generally required to establish compliance with regulation on product qualities. Veri/fication testing con/firms geological maps prepared during earlier exploration programmes; and\n- \u00b7 In the case of cement raw materials, facility laboratories participate in an externally managed annual review process with ISO 17025 accredited independent laboratories\n\nWhen exploration programmes are conducted, QA/ QC measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that surface or drill sampling results in the highest quality sample possible. This would include down-hole surveying of drill holes as necessary;\n- \u00b7 Obtain pictures of drill sample (e.g. core) for future reference;\n- \u00b7 Geological core logging prior to laboratory analysis. Description of sample at various intervals;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the integrity of samples from point of origin to analytical laboratory; and\n- \u00b7 Using nationally or regionally accredited laboratories for all analyses and tests for exploration programmes in properties containing aggregates\n\nIn addition, to provide further assurance over the Group's mineral reserves and resources reporting process, the Group's Internal Audit function completed a limited scope review across a sample of material reporting entities on the operation of these internal controls as at 31 December 2021.",

There are numerous uncertainties inherent in reserves estimation and in projecting future rates of production.\n\n## Impact:\n\nFailure by the Group to plan for reserve depletion, or to secure permits, may result in operation stoppages, adversely impacting /financial performance.\n\nThe Group's reserves for the production of primary building materials (which encompasses cement, lime, aggregates (stone, sand and gravel), asphalt, readymixed concrete and concrete products) fall into a variety of categories spanning a wide number of rock types and geological classi/fications found within our extensive network of quarry locations in attractive local markets globally. Continuity of the cash /flows derived from the production and sale of building materials is dependent on satisfactory reserves planning and on the presence of appropriate long-term arrangements for their replacement. There can be no assurance that the required licences and permits will be forthcoming at the appropriate juncture or that relevant operating entities will continue to satisfy the many terms and conditions under which such licences and permits are granted.\n\nThe failure to plan adequately for current and future extraction and utilisation or to ensure ongoing compliance with the requirements of issuing authorities could lead to withdrawal of the related licence or permit and consequential disruption to operations. For additional information on the Group's reserve position, see page 226 of this Supplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures section.",

This could include physical risks, such as acute and chronic changes in weather and/or transitional risks such as technological development, policy and regulation change and market and economic responses.\n\n## Impact:\n\nShould the Group not reduce its greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions by its identi/fied targets, the Group may be subject to increased costs, adverse /financial performance and reputational damage.\n\n## Physical Risks including:\n\n- \u00b7 Acute & Chronic: Acute weather events such as hurricanes or /flooding and chronic weather events such as sea level rise or higher temperatures may have an adverse effect on the Group's business and operations. Operational productivity and demand for the Group's products may be reduced during these weather events leading to reduced /financial performance\n\n## Transition Risks including:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology: The failure to leverage innovation arising from technological advances related to carbon ef/ficiencies in products and processes may increase operational costs, shorten product life cycles or give rise to early product obsolescence, thus impairing /financial performance and/or future value creation\n- \u00b7 Legal & Regulatory: Efforts to address climate change through laws and regulations, for example by requiring reductions in emissions of GHGs such as CO 2 , can create economic risks and uncertainties for the Group's businesses. Such risks could include the cost of purchasing allowances or credits to meet GHG emissions caps, the cost of installing equipment to reduce emissions to comply with GHG limits or required technological standards, decreased pro/fits or losses arising from decreased demand for the Group's goods and higher production costs resulting directly or indirectly from the imposition of legislative or regulatory controls. Manifestation of these increased costs may increase the underlying cost of production of the Group's products which may adversely impact the /financial performance of the Group\n- \u00b7 Market & Reputation: Stakeholder expectations in relation to climate change continue to increase. The Group is subject to a broad range of additional environmental product information requests by customers in certain regions and increasing levels of disclosure regarding climate-related environmental performance from /financial institutions, investors and other interested stakeholders. The Group includes within its product portfolio products aimed at climate adaptation, including sustainable drainage systems, /flood defences and more resilient structures, as well as products that lower the operational carbon footprint of buildings, including high performance glass and glazing products that incorporate innovative thermal break technologies for superior thermal performance, precast concrete /flooring and walling elements delivering energy savings, and balcony connector products that reduce thermal bridging, delivering energy savings. If customers' and other stakeholders' sustainability expectations are not satis/fied, the Group's product portfolio may be of reduced relevance due to weakened customer demand, the Group's reputation may be harmed through not meeting investor expectations, and the Group could experience a deterioration in /financial performance, such as increased cost of capital\n\nThe Group continues to be exposed to costs related to carbon emissions trading schemes. While these costs do not currently have a material /financial impact, there can be no assurances that more extensive carbon cost mechanisms may be introduced that could potentially impact the Group's /financial performance. Further, the Group continues to engage with stakeholders to fully understand their expectations in relation to climate change. However, it is recognised that expectations continue to evolve rapidly, and the Group cannot guarantee that all stakeholders' expectations will continue to be met.\n\nPlease refer to page 242 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F for further details. In addition, the Group publishes an annual independently-assured Sustainability Report, which is available on www.crh.com.",

In addition, various assumptions are made in the computation of the overall tax charge and in balance sheet provisions which may need to be adjusted over time.\n\n## Impact:\n\nChanges in tax regimes or assessment of additional tax liabilities in future tax audits could result in incremental tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on cash /flows and the /financial results of operations.\n\nThe Group's income tax charge is based on reported pro/fits and statutory tax rates, which re/flect various allowances and reliefs and tax ef/ficiencies available to the Group in the multiple tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of the Group's provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition of deferred tax assets also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. In addition, the Group is subject to tax audits which can involve complex issues that could require extended periods to conclude, the resolution of which is often not within its control. Although management believes that the estimates included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group's tax return positions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the /final outcome of these matters will equal the estimates re/flected in the Group's historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nAs a multinational corporation, the Group is subject to various taxes in all jurisdictions of operation. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates and the interpretation of tax rules in these jurisdictions may be subject to signi/ficant change, heightened during administration changes or periods of /fiscal de/ficit in these economies. For example, there are potential tax rate increases in the US under the Biden administration tax policy proposals. In addition, the Group's future effective income tax rate could be affected (positively or negatively) by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\n\nFinally, changes to international tax principles, for example at an EU level, could adversely affect the Group's effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If the Group's effective income tax rate was to increase, its cash /flows and the /financial results of operations could be adversely affected.",

Description: Signi/ficant under-performance in any of the Group's  major cash-generating units or the divestment of  businesses in the future may give rise to a material  write-down of goodwill. | An acquisition generates goodwill to the extent that the price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets  acquired. Under IFRS, goodwill and inde/finite-lived intangible assets are not amortised but are subject to annual  impairment testing. Other intangible assets deemed separable from goodwill arising on acquisitions are amortised.  A detailed discussion of the impairment testing process, the key assumptions used, the results of that testing and  the related sensitivity analysis is contained in note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 174 to |\n| Impact: While a non-cash item, a material write-down of  goodwill could have a substantial impact on the  Group's income and equity.                                                               | 176. While a goodwill impairment charge does not impact cash /flow, a full write-down at 31 December 2021 would  have resulted in a charge to income and a reduction in equity of $9.5 billion (2020: $9.0 billion).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |",

For additional information on the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Consolidated Financial  Statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2021, see the Business Performance and  Segmental Reviews section commencing on page 36 and note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on  pages 189 to 192. |\n\n## Corporate Governance Practices\n\n## Compliance Statement\n\nNon-US companies such as CRH are exempt from most of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. In common with companies listed on the LSE and Euronext Dublin, CRH's corporate governance practices re/flect, inter alia, compliance with (a) domestic company law; (b) the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Euronext Dublin; and (c) the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, which is appended to the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin.\n\nThe Board of CRH has adopted a robust set of governance principles, which re/flect the 2018 Code and its principles-based approach to corporate governance. Accordingly, the way in which CRH makes determinations of Directors' independence differs from the NYSE rules. The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive Directors are independent. In doing so the Board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\nHowever, the Board has determined that all of the non-executive Directors on the Audit Committee are independent according to the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Further, CRH considers that the Terms of Reference for its Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee are generally responsive to the relevant NYSE rules, but may not address all aspects of such rules.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nThe NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans with certain limited exceptions. CRH complies with Irish requirements, which are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed de/finition on what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems to the Audit Committee 1 . Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, in the case of internal control systems, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared subject to oversight and control of the Finance Director, who seeks to ensure that data is captured from Group locations and all required information for disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements is provided. An appropriate control framework has been put in place around the recording of appropriate consolidation journals and other adjustments. The Consolidated Financial Statements are reviewed by the internal CRH Financial Reporting and Disclosure Group prior to\n\nbeing reviewed by the Finance Director and Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nGroup management has responsibility for major strategic development and /financing decisions. Responsibility for operational issues is devolved, subject to limits of authority, to product group and operating company management. Management at all levels is responsible for internal control over the business functions that have been delegated. This embedding of the system of internal control throughout the Group's operations is designed to enable the organisation to respond quickly to evolving business risks, and to ensure that signi/ficant internal control issues, should they arise, are reported promptly to appropriate levels of management.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Rule 13a-15 of the US Securities Exchange Act, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Company's internal control over /financial reporting. As de/fined by the SEC, internal control over /financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal /financial of/ficers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:",

Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /financial reporting and the preparation of our Company's published Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes under generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company's annual Consolidated Financial Statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over\n\n/financial reporting as of 31 December 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nManagement's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over /financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded and hereby reports that as of 31 December 2021, the Company's internal control over /financial reporting is effective.\n\nOur auditors, Deloitte, a registered public accounting /firm, who have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, have audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over /financial reporting. Their report, on which an unquali/fied opinion is expressed thereon, is included on page 138.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring 2021, there has been no change in our internal control over /financial reporting identi/fied in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report and Form 20-F that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over /financial reporting.\n\nAcquisitions excluded from the 2020 assessment of internal control over /financial reporting were all successfully integrated into the CRH internal control systems in 2021.\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nManagement has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as de/fined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of 31 December 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the level of providing reasonable assurance.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, recognised that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost-bene/fit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 Oldcastle APG, part of CRH's Building Products Division, opened a new dualbagging-line, dry-mix facility located at Cowpens, South Carolina, United States.

        "page_content": "## The Environment and Government Regulations\n\nAs a building materials company, environmental laws and regulations relevant to extractive and production processes are signi/ficant to CRH. In Europe, operations are subject to national environmental laws and regulations, most of which now emanate from European Union Directives and Regulations. In North America, operations may be subject to federal, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations. In other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, national environmental and local laws apply.\n\n## Environmental Compliance Policy\n\nIn order to comply with environmental regulations and address environmental risks and opportunities, CRH has developed an environmental policy. The statement of policy, applied across all Group companies, is to:\n\n- \u00b7  address proactively the challenges of climate change, reduce emissions and waste as well as optimise our use of energy, water, land and other resources;\n- \u00b7  promote sustainable product and process innovation and new business opportunities;\n- \u00b7  support and enhance biodiversity, ensuring responsible land use and biodiversity management;\n- \u00b7  comply with or exceed all applicable environmental legislation and continually implement and improve our environmental management systems, always striving to meet or exceed industry best practice standards, monitoring and reporting performance;\n- \u00b7  maintain open communications and ensure that our employees and contractors are aware of and adhere to their environmental responsibilities; and\n- \u00b7  maintain positive relationships with stakeholders through engagement and consultation, always striving to be good neighbours in every community in which we operate\n\n## Environmental Management and Governance\n\nAchieving the Group's environmental policy objectives at all locations is a management imperative. At Board level there is a dedicated Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility (SESR) Committee.\n\nOverseen by the Board, the Chief Executive has overall responsibility for CRH's sustainability performance and for ensuring sustainability policies are implemented in all business lines.\n\nDaily responsibility for ensuring that the Group's environmental policy is effectively implemented lies with individual location managers, assisted by a network of Group environmental specialists.\n\nAt each year end, the Group Sustainability function carries out a detailed assessment of Group environmental performance, which is reviewed by the SESR Committee and the Board.\n\n## Addressing Climate Change\n\nCRH continues to be a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and is a founding member of the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), which is dedicated to developing and strengthening the sector's contribution to sustainable construction. Through its membership of the GCCA, WBCSD and various regional industry associations, CRH is actively involved in global and regional discussions on the climate change agenda.\n\nEuropean Union leaders in 2021 launched the 'Fit for 55' package of legislative proposals and policy initiatives that aim for an emissions reduction target of at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990. CRH is monitoring forthcoming legislative requirements and planning for continued compliance.\n\nCRH's operations in the US are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations addressing climate change. Ultimately more comprehensive 'cap and trade' schemes or other emission reduction legislation may be implemented in the US and Canada; depending on the scope of the legislation, this could signi/ficantly impact certain operations in North America. CRH continuously monitors developments in regulations and greenhouse gas initiatives involving local, provincial, state or federal governments. As of 18 February 2022, the Group is not aware of any such schemes that would materially affect its US operations.\n\nCRH is committed to proactively addressing the challenges of climate change, which may have a multi-faceted impact on our business strategy. As a provider of building materials and integrated solutions that address the needs of a climate-resilient built environment, there are likely to be strong growth opportunities for CRH. Ongoing public investment will need to create more resilient infrastructure and cities, which require higher safety characteristics and are better suited to extreme weather events like rising water levels and high wind events. CRH includes within its offerings multiple products aimed at climate adaptation and mitigation, including sustainable drainage systems, concrete products used in /flood defence systems, products contributing to more resilient structures as well as products with high levels of recycled content, such as recycled asphalt pavement. From a physical risk perspective climate change may have implications on business continuity and mitigating against supply chain disruption.\n\nA management strategy has been put in place to address these risks and opportunities. In 2020, CRH\n\nappointed a dedicated member of our executive leadership team with responsibility for Enterprise Strategy, Sustainability & Innovation, to drive the innovation agenda and enterprise strategy around providing sustainable solutions for customers. In 2021, a speci/fic Climate Change committee was established at executive leadership level, to further drive our climate strategy. In delivering this management strategy, CRH seeks to reduce carbon emissions and energy usage, achieve /financial ef/ficiencies, and, in addition, help to address the global challenges of climate change.\n\nCRH has developed an ambition to achieve carbon neutrality along the cement and concrete value chain by 2050. As evidence of progress in relation to its decarbonisation efforts, in 2021 CRH announced the expectation to achieve its 2030 carbon emissions reduction target of 520kg CO 2 /tonne of cementitious product by 2025. This target represents a 33% reduction in speci/fic net cement CO 2 compared with 1990 levels. In early 2022, the Group adopted a new SBTi approved target for a 25% reduction in group-wide absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO 2 emissions by 2030 (from a 2020 baseline).\n\nIn order to meet its target, CRH has implemented capital expenditure programmes in its cement operations to reduce carbon emissions in the context of international and national commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as CRH's own emission reduction programme and targets discussed above. In regions and countries where trading schemes are in operation, facilities that fall within the scope of this legislation comply with CO 2 'cap and trade' schemes, including the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and other regional schemes.\n\n## Possible Environmental Liabilities\n\nAt 18 February 2022, there were no pending legal proceedings relating to site remediation which are anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the /financial position or results of operations or liquidity of the Group, nor have internal reviews revealed any situations of likely material environmental liability to the Group.\n\n## Governmental Policies\n\nThe overall level of government capital expenditures and the allocation by state entities of available funds to different projects, as well as interest rate and tax policies, directly affect the overall levels of construction activity. The terms and general availability of government permits required to conduct Group business also has an impact on the scope of Group operations. As a result such governmental decisions and policies can have a signi/ficant impact on the operating results of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy\n\n## Compliance Statement\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is part of the EU's overall efforts to implement the European Green Deal. It is intended to serve as a standardised and mandatory classi/fication system to determine which economic activities are considered as 'environmentally sustainable' by the EU.\n\nIn June 2021, the European Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act with its Annexes, establishing the Technical Screening Criteria that de/fine which activities substantially contribute to the /first two, out of six, environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy regulation, namely climate change mitigation (Annex I), and climate change adaptation (Annex II).\n\nThe Technical Screening Criteria for the remaining four environmental objectives are expected to be published in 2022.\n\nAn economic activity which is described in Annex I or Annex II of the Climate Delegated Act is Taxonomy-eligible, irrespective of whether it meets the respective Technical Screening Criteria or not.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the share of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) are required to be disclosed in line with the published EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\n## CRH's assessment of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities\n\nBased on the descriptions of economic activities included in Annex I and Annex II of the Climate Delegated Act, we assessed our activities and identi/fied those which are Taxonomy-eligible.\n\nThe Climate Delegated Act prioritised speci/fic sectors responsible for 94% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. A high proportion of CRH's activities do not fall into these prioritised sectors and are not in scope of the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nWhile the Climate Delegated Act does not cover a high proportion of our economic activities, we have identi/fied the economic activity '3.7 Manufacture of cement' as a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity. Our turnover, CapEx and OpEx exclusively refer to turnover, assets or processes associated with this economic activity.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible Turnover\n\nThe share of Taxonomy-eligible turnover is calculated by the proportion of turnover derived from economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible (numerator) over total turnover (denominator).\n\n## Share of Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities\n\n|                              |   Total  $bn | Share of   Taxonomy-eligible  economic activities   | Share of  Taxonomy non-eligible  economic activities   |\n|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Turnover                     |         31   | 14%                                                 | 86%                                                    |\n| Capital Expenditure (CapEx)  |          2.5 | 14%                                                 | 86%                                                    |\n| Operating Expenditure (OpEx) |          1.5 | 23%                                                 | 77%                                                    |\n\nThe total turnover represents the consolidated revenue, and amounts to $31.0 billion for the /financial year ended 31 December 2021 (as disclosed in our Consolidated Income Statement on page 140). The accounting policy applicable for revenue recognition is addressed in detail on page 148 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCRH's share of turnover associated with Taxonomyeligible economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was 14%.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible Capital Expenditure\n\nThe share of Taxonomy-eligible CapEx is calculated by the proportion of CapEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible (numerator) over total CapEx (denominator).\n\nTotal CapEx includes additions to tangible and intangible assets, considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, and excluding fair value changes. It also includes additions as a result of business combinations. Total CapEx involves all additions to Property, Plant and Equipment, Right-of-Use Assets and Intangible Assets. Any acquired goodwill is not considered for this purpose.\n\nFor the reconciliation of total CapEx please see note 13, note 14 and note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCRH's share of CapEx associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was 14%.\n\nCRH continuously invests in technology and ef/ficiency projects across our operating companies to enhance environmental performance, as well as investing in the environmental element of major capital investment projects to ensure we reach our CO 2 reduction targets.\n\n## Taxonomy-eligible Operating Expenditure\n\nThe share of Taxonomy-eligible OpEx is calculated by the proportion of OpEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-eligible (numerator) over total OpEx (denominator).\n\nEU Taxonomy regulations de/fine total OpEx as the direct non-capitalised costs of research and\n\ndevelopment (R&D), building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment.\n\nAs the EU Taxonomy regulation has its own de/finition of OpEx, the reported OpEx only represents a proportion of the total Group cost of sales and operating costs, and mainly includes R&D costs, repairs and maintenance and short-term leases.\n\nCRH's share of OpEx associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2021 was 23%.\n\n## Future Regulatory Developments\n\nFrom the year ending 31 December 2022 onwards, Taxonomy-alignment will also become part of EU Taxonomy reporting. An economic activity is Taxonomy-aligned if it ful/fils all the following requirements:\n\n- \u00b7  Contributes substantially to at least one environmental objective by meeting the de/fined Technical Screening Criteria;\n- \u00b7  Doing no signi/ficant harm to any of the other environmental objectives; and\n- \u00b7  Is carried out in compliance with 'Minimum Social Safeguards'\n\nIn accordance with the published Delegated Acts, CRH will carry out an assessment of Taxonomy-alignment and report on Taxonomy-alignment in the next /financial year.\n\nFurthermore, EU taxonomy reporting is expected be expanded to include the four further environmental objectives, namely:\n\n- \u00b7  Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;\n- \u00b7  Transition to a circular economy;\n- \u00b7  Pollution prevention and control; and\n- \u00b7  Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems",

The technique used measures the estimated impact on pro/fit before tax\n\nand on total equity arising on net year-end /floating rate debt and on year-end equity, based on either an increase/decrease of 1% in /floating interest rates or a 5% strengthening/weakening in the US Dollar/euro exchange rate. The US Dollar/euro rate has been selected for this sensitivity analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. This analysis, set out in note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is for illustrative purposes only as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative information and sensitivity analysis of market risk is contained in notes 21 to 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nCRH does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on CRH's /financial condition, changes in /financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.",

As a result of Brexit, CREST was no longer available to any Irish incorporated issuers, irrespective of whether they are listed in Ireland, London or both, and all Irish issuers had to migrate from CREST to the market's chosen replacement system, Euroclear Bank Belgium.\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting was held on 9 February 2021 to seek shareholder approval to the migration of the Company's securities to Euroclear Bank's central securities depository and to approve associated changes to the Articles of Association. All resolutions were passed and the migration took effect on 15 March 2021.\n\nSee note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.",

        "page_content": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in respect of each /fiscal year since the formation of the Group in 1970. Dividends are paid to shareholders on the Register of Members on the record date for the dividend. Record dates are set in accordance with the rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin. An interim dividend is normally declared by the Board of Directors in August of each year and is generally paid in September/October. A /final dividend is normally recommended by the Board of Directors following the end of the /fiscal year to which it relates and, if approved by the shareholders at an AGM, is generally paid in April/May of that year.\n\nThe payment of future cash dividends will be dependent upon future earnings, the /financial condition of the Group and other factors.\n\nThe below table sets forth the amounts of interim, /final and total dividends declared in US cents (2020 - 2021) and euro cent (2017-2019) per Ordinary Share in respect of each /fiscal year indicated. Solely for the convenience of the reader, dividends declared in the years 2017-2019 have been translated into US cents per Ordinary Share at the dividend record date exchange rate. An interim dividend of 23.00 US cents was paid in respect of Ordinary Shares on 8 October 2021. The /final dividend, if approved at the forthcoming AGM of shareholders to be held on 28 April 2022, will be paid on 5 May 2022 to shareholders on the Register of Members as at the close of business on 11 March 2022 and will bring the full-year dividend for 2021 to 121.0 US cents.\n\nDividend Withholding Tax (DWT) must be deducted from dividends paid by an Irish resident company, unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company's Registrars, Link Registrars Limited (the 'Registrars'). DWT applies to dividends paid by way of cash or by way of shares under a scrip dividend scheme and is deducted at the standard rate of Income Tax (25%). Non-resident shareholders\n\nlocated in countries with a double tax treaty with Ireland and certain Irish companies, trusts, pension schemes, investment undertakings and charities may be entitled to claim exemption from DWT. Copies of the exemption form may be obtained from the Registrars. Shareholders should note that DWT will be deducted from dividends in cases where a properly completed form has not been received by the speci/fied deadline noti/fied when a dividend is announced. Individuals who are resident in the Republic of Ireland for tax purposes are not entitled to an exemption. If shares are held via Euroclear Bank or CREST, the owners of the shares will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for their dividends to be exempted.\n\nShareholders holding Ordinary Shares in certi/ficated form who wish to have their dividend paid direct to their bank account, by electronic funds transfer, can do so by logging on to www.signalshares.com, selecting CRH plc and registering for the share portal (the 'Share Portal'). Shareholders should note that they will need to have their Investor Code (found on their share certi/ficate), and follow the instructions online to register.\n\nAlternatively such shareholders can complete a paper dividend mandate form and submit it to the Registrars. A copy of the form can be obtained on the Registrars's Share Portal or can be requested directly from the Registrars. Tax vouchers will continue to be sent to the shareholder's registered address under this arrangement.\n\nIf shares are held via Euroclear Bank or CREST, the dividend will be paid by the Company in accordance with the instructions received from Euroclear Bank.\n\nSection 5 of the Euroclear Terms and Conditions governing use of the Euroclear system provides that income/dividends received by Euroclear Bank will be distributed pro-rata to the holders of the relevant\n\nsecurities (i.e. the relevant EB Participants). Further details on the process of collection, distribution and payment of dividends are provided for in section 5.3 of the EB Operating Procedures, with reference to the Online Market Guides for market speci/fic operational elements (currently the EB Service Description). All material information regarding the manner in which receipt of dividends and participation in corporate actions is processed is described in section 5 of the EB Services Description- (Version 4) - Custody - Income and Corporate Actions. The owners of the shares held via Euroclear Bank or CREST will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for the onward payment of the dividend to them.\n\nFollowing the change in reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020, all dividends are declared in US Dollar. However, they are generally paid in euro. In order to avoid costs to shareholders, dividends are paid in Pound Sterling and US Dollar to shareholders whose shares are held in certi/ficated form and whose address, according to the Share Register, is in the UK and the US respectively, unless they require otherwise. In respect of the 2021 /final dividend, the latest date for receipt of currency elections is 25 March 2022. Where shares are held in the Euroclear Bank system, dividends are automatically paid in euro unless a currency election is made.\n\nInvestors holding CREST Depositary Interests ('CDI's) should refer to the CREST International Service Description for information on currency elections in respect of CDIs.\n\nDividends in respect of 7% 'A' Cumulative Preference Shares are paid half-yearly on 5 April and 5 October.

        "page_content": "## Share Plans\n\nThe Group operates share option schemes, performance share plans, share participation schemes and savings-related share option schemes (the 'Schemes') for eligible employees in all regions where the regulations permit the operation of such schemes. A brief description of the Schemes is outlined below. Shares issued (whether by way of the allotment of new shares or the reissue of Treasury Shares) in connection with the Schemes rank pari passu in all respects with the existing shares in the Company.\n\n## 2010 Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of new share option schemes to replace the schemes which were approved in May 2000 (2000 share option schemes). Following the approval by shareholders of the 2014 Performance Share Plan (see below), no further awards will be granted under the 2010 Share Option Schemes. Consequently, the last award under the 2010 Share Option Schemes was made in 2013.\n\nThe 2010 Share Option Schemes were based on one tier of options with a single vesting test. The performance criteria for the 2010 Share Option Schemes was EPS-based. Vesting only occurred once an initial performance target had been reached and, thereafter, exercise was dependent on continued employment in the Group. In considering the level of vesting based on EPS performance, the Remuneration Committee also considered the overall results of the Group.\n\nSubject to the achievement of the EPS performance criteria, options may be exercised not later than ten years from the date of grant of the option, and not earlier than the expiration of three years from the date of grant. Bene/fits under the schemes are not pensionable.\n\n## 2014 Performance Share Plan\n\nThe 2014 Performance Share Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 7 May 2014. It replaces the 2010 Share Option Scheme. See page 99 of the 2021 Directors' Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## Restricted Share Plan\n\nIn 2013, the Board approved the adoption of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan. Under the rules of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan, certain senior executives (excluding executive Board Directors) can receive conditional awards of shares. As (i) executive Directors are excluded from awards and (ii) no shares are allotted or reissued to satisfy the awards, the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin do not require shareholder approval for the 2013 Restricted Share Plan.\n\n## 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of savings-related share option schemes for the UK and Ireland (the '2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes') to replace the 2000 Savings-related Share Option Schemes. These schemes expired in May 2020.\n\nPrior to the expiry of these schemes, all employees of a participating subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland or the UK, who had satis/fied a required qualifying period, would be invited to participate in this scheme.\n\nEligible employees who wished to participate in the scheme would enter into a savings contract with a nominated savings institution, for a three or a /five-year period, to save a maximum of \u20ac500 or Stg\u00a3500, as appropriate, per month.\n\nAt the commencement of each contract period employees would have been granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company at an option price which is equal to the amount proposed to be saved plus the bonus payable by the nominated savings institution at the end of the savings period. The price payable for each Ordinary Share under an option could not be less than the higher of par or 75% (or in the case of the UK scheme 80%) of the market value of a share on the day the invitation to apply for the option is issued.\n\nOn completion of the savings contract, employees may use the amount saved, together with the bonus earned, to exercise the option.\n\nAt 2 March 2022, 2,118,642 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes to date.\n\n## 2021 Savings-related Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 29 April 2021, shareholders approved the adoption of savings-related share options schemes for the UK and Ireland (the '2021 Savings-related Share Option Schemes') to replace the 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes. These schemes expired in May 2020.\n\nAll employees of a participating subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland or the UK, who have satis/fied a required qualifying period, are invited to participate in this scheme, although at present there is currently no /financial services provider supporting new awards under Irish SAYE schemes following the exit from the market of the current provider in 2021. Eligible employees who wish to participate in the scheme enter into a savings contract with a nominated savings institution, for a three or a /five-year period, to save a maximum of \u20ac500 or Stg\u00a3500, as appropriate, per month.\n\nAt the commencement of each contract period employees are granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company at an option price which is equal to the amount proposed to be saved plus the bonus payable by the nominated savings institution at the end of the savings period. The price payable for each Ordinary Share under an option will not be less than the higher of par or 85% of the market value of a share on the day the invitation to apply for the option is issued.\n\nOn completion of the savings contract, employees may use the amount saved, together with the bonus earned, to exercise the option.\n\nAt 2 March 2022, no Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the 2021 Savings-related Share Option Scheme to date.\n\n## Share Participation Schemes\n\nAt the AGM on 13 May 1987, shareholders approved the establishment of Share Participation Schemes for the Company, its subsidiaries and companies under its control. Directors and employees of the companies who are tax resident in Ireland and have at least one year's service may elect to participate in these Share Participation Schemes.\n\nAt 2 March 2022, 8,444,240 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the Share Participation Schemes.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation\n\nThe following summary outlines the material aspects of US federal income and Republic of Ireland tax law regarding the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs. Because it is a summary, holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their ownership or disposition. The discussion regarding US federal income tax only applies to you if you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for US federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only US federal income and Republic of Ireland taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This summary does not take into account the speci/fic circumstances of any particular holders (such as tax-exempt entities, certain insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, investors liable for alternative minimum tax, investors that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the stock of the Company (by vote or value), investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the US Dollar), some of which may be subject to special rules. In addition, if a partnership holds the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below. Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to US federal, state and local, Republic of Ireland and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of Ordinary Shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the bene/fits of the Income Tax Treaty (as de/fined below) in respect of their investment in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nThe statements regarding US and Irish laws set forth below are based, in part, on representations of the Depositary and assume that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with their terms.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations, published rulings and court decisions, and the laws of the Republic of Ireland all as currently in effect, as well as the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes\n\non Income and Capital Gains (the 'Income Tax Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nIn general, holders of ADSs will be treated as the owners of Ordinary Shares represented thereby for the purposes of the Income Tax Treaty and for US federal income tax purposes. Exchanges of Ordinary Shares for ADSs, and ADSs for Ordinary Shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income or Irish tax.\n\nAs used herein, the term 'US holder' means a bene/ficial owner of an Ordinary Share or ADS who, for US federal income tax purposes: (i) is a US citizen or resident, a US corporation, an estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust, and (ii) is not a resident of, or ordinarily resident in, the Republic of Ireland for purposes of Irish taxes.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends Paid to US Holders\n\nUnder general Irish tax law, US holders are not liable for Irish tax on dividends received from the Company. On the payment of dividends, the Company is obliged to withhold DWT. The statutory rate during 2021 was 25% of the dividend payable. Dividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident individual will be exempt from DWT provided the following conditions are met:\n\n- 1.  the individual (who must be the bene/ficial owner) is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland; and\n- 2.   the individual signs a declaration to the Company, which states that he/she is a US tax resident individual at the time of making the declaration and that he/she will notify the Company in writing when he/she no longer meets the condition in (1) above; or\n- 3.   the individual provides the Company with a certi/ficate of tax residency from the US tax authorities\n\nDividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident company (which must be the bene/ficial owner) will be exempt from DWT, provided the following conditions are met:\n\n- 1.   the recipient company is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and not under the control, either directly or indirectly, of Irish resident persons;\n\n- 2.  the recipient company is not tax resident in Ireland; and\n- 3.   the recipient company provides a declaration to the Company, which states that it is entitled to an exemption from DWT, on the basis that it meets the condition in (1) above at the time of making the declaration, and that it will notify the Company when it no longer meets the condition in (1) above\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, and subject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules discussed below, US holders will include in gross income the gross amount of any dividend paid by the Company out of its current or accumulated earnings and pro/fits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes) as ordinary income when the dividend is actually or constructively received by the US holder, in the case of Ordinary Shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. Any Irish tax withheld from this dividend payment must be included in this gross amount even though the amount withheld is not in fact received. Dividends paid to non-corporate US holders that constitute quali/fied dividend income will be taxed at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided certain holding period requirements are met. Dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs generally will be quali/fied dividend income.\n\nDividends paid by CRH will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution includable in income of a US holder will be the US Dollar value of the dividends on the date they are distributed, regardless of whether the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars. If the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars, generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange /fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend payment is distributed to the date such payment is received will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to quali/fied dividend income. Such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation - continued\n\nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and pro/fits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, the Company does not calculate earnings and pro/fits in accordance with US federal income tax principles. Accordingly, US holders should expect to generally treat distributions the Company makes as dividends.\n\nFor foreign tax credit limitation purposes, dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs will generally be income from sources outside the US, and will, depending on your circumstances, generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to a US holder.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Irish tax withheld in accordance with the Income Tax Treaty and paid over to the Republic of Ireland will be creditable or deductible against your US federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Any Irish tax withheld from distributions will not be eligible for a foreign tax credit to the extent an exemption from the tax withheld is available to the US holder.\n\n## Capital Gains Tax\n\nA US holder will not be liable for Irish tax on gains realised on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs unless the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business carried on by such holder in the Republic of Ireland through a branch or agency. A US holder will be liable for US federal income tax on such gains in the same manner as gains from a sale or other disposition of any other shares in a company.\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules below, US holders who sell or otherwise dispose of Ordinary Shares or ADSs will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US Dollar value of the amount realised on the sale or disposition and the tax basis, determined in US Dollars, in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nCapital gains of a non-corporate US holder are generally taxed at a preferential rate where the holder has a holding period greater than one year, and the capital gain or loss will generally be US source for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## Capital Acquisitions Tax (Estate/Gift Tax)\n\nAlthough non-residents may hold Ordinary Shares, the shares are deemed to be situated in the Republic of Ireland, because the Company is required to maintain its Share Register in the Republic of Ireland for Irish Capital Gains Tax purposes.\n\nAccordingly, holders of Ordinary Shares may be subject to Irish gift or inheritance tax, notwithstanding that the parties involved are domiciled and resident outside the Republic of Ireland. Certain exemption thresholds apply to gifts and inheritances depending on the relationship between the donor and donee.\n\nUnder the Ireland-US Estate Tax Treaty with respect to taxes on the estates of deceased persons, credit against US federal estate tax is available in respect of any Irish inheritance tax payable in respect of transfers of Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Additional US Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThe Company believes that Ordinary Shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes and does not expect them to become stock of a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. If the Company is treated as a PFIC and you are a US holder that did not make a mark-to-market election, you will be subject to special rules with respect to any gain you realise on the sale or other disposition of your Ordinary Shares or ADSs and any excess distribution that the Company makes to you. Generally, any such gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the amount allocated to the taxable year in which you realised the gain or received the excess distribution, or to prior years before the /first year in which we were a PFIC with respect to you, will be taxed as ordinary income, the amount allocated to each prior year will be generally taxed as ordinary income at the highest tax rate in effect for each other such year, and an interest charge will be applied to any tax attributable to such\n\ngain or excess distribution for the prior years. With certain exceptions, Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if the company was a PFIC at any time during the investor's holding period in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. In addition, dividends that you receive from the Company will not constitute quali/fied dividend income to you if the Company is deemed to be a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Stamp Duty\n\nSection 90 Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 exempts from Irish stamp duty transfers of ADSs where the ADSs are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the US and the underlying deposited securities are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange. The Irish tax authorities regard NASDAQ and the NYSE as recognised stock exchanges. Irish stamp duty will be charged at the rate of 1% of the amount or value of the consideration on any conveyance or transfer on sale of Ordinary Shares (exemption generally available in the case of single transfers with a value of less than \u20ac1,000). Exchanges of Ordinary Shares for ADSs, and ADSs for Ordinary Shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty in certain circumstances.",

The Board may grant special remuneration to any of its number who being called upon, shall render any special or extra services to the Company or go or reside abroad in connection with the conduct of any of the affairs of the Company.\n\nThe quali/fication of a Director is the holding alone and not jointly with any other person of 1,000 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nThe Articles provide that, at shareholders' meetings, holders of Ordinary Shares, either in person or by proxy, are entitled to one vote on a show of hands and one vote per share on a poll. No member is entitled to vote at any general meeting unless all calls or other sums immediately payable in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.\n\n## Laws, Decrees or Other Regulations\n\nThere are no restrictions under the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company or under Irish law that limit the right of non-Irish residents or foreign owners freely to hold their Ordinary Shares or to vote their Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Liquidation Rights/Return of Capital\n\nIn the event of the Company being wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a shareholders' special resolution, divide among the holders of the Ordinary Shares the whole or any part of the net assets of the Company (after the return of capital and payment of accrued dividends on the preference shares) in cash or in kind, and may set such values as he deems fair upon any property to be so divided and determine how such division will be carried out. The liquidator may, with a like sanction, vest such assets in trust as he thinks /fit, but no shareholders will be compelled to accept any shares or other assets upon which there is any liability.\n\n## Variation of Rights\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2014, the rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\n## Issue of Shares\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 and the Articles of Association, the issue of shares is at the discretion of the Directors.\n\n## Dividends\n\nShareholders may by ordinary resolution declare /final dividends and the Directors may declare interim dividends but no /final dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors and no dividend may be paid otherwise than out of income available for that purpose in accordance with the Companies Act 2014. There is provision to offer scrip dividends in lieu of cash. The preference shares rank for /fixed rate dividends in priority to the Ordinary and Income Shares for the time being of the Company. Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date of its declaration shall, if the Directors so decide, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company.\n\n## Meetings\n\nShareholder meetings may be convened by majority vote of the Directors or requisitioned by shareholders holding not less than 5% of the voting rights of the Company. A quorum for a general meeting of the Company is constituted by two or more shareholders present in person and entitled to vote. The passing of resolutions at a meeting of the Company, other than special resolutions, requires a simple majority. A special resolution, in respect of which not less than 21 clear days' notice in writing must be given, requires the af/firmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## Disclosure of Shareholders' Interests\n\nA shareholder may lose the right to vote by not complying with any statutory notice or notice pursuant to Article 14 of the Articles of Association given by the Company requiring an indication in writing of: (i) the capacity in which the shares are held or any interest therein; (ii) the persons who have an interest in the shares and the nature of their interest; or (iii) whether any of the voting rights carried by such shares are the subject of any agreement or arrangement under which another person is entitled to control the shareholder's exercise of these rights.\n\n## Preference Shares\n\nDetails of the 5% and 7% 'A' Cumulative Preference Shares are disclosed in note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Use of Electronic Communication\n\nWhenever the Company, a Director, the Secretary, a member or any of/ficer or person is required or permitted by the Articles of Association to give information in writing, such information may be given by electronic means or in electronic form, whether as electronic communication or otherwise, provided that the electronic means or electronic form has been approved by the Directors.",

Due to the dry climate, when it rains stormwater runoff cannot in/filtrate back into the soil and recharge the aquafers, resulting in surface /flooding and a depleted water supply. MaxCapture is a customisable, modular system which integrates two existing Oldcastle Infrastructure systems, StormCapture \u00ae and MaxWell \u00ae to detain and in/filtrate large volumes of stormwater runoff, maximising effectiveness while reducing both the overall footprint and installation cost of the solution.",
