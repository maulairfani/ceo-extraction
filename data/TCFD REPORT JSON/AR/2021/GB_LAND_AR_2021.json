The year ended with new emerging challenges resulting from geopolitical risk, and with rising in/flation increasing pressure on consumer incomes and a/ffecting the construction industry, but we remain very well placed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Central London\n\nIn our Central London portfolio, we achieved a record year of leasing, with \u00a363m of o/ffice lettings completed, 4% ahead of valuers' assumptions. Our overall occupancy remains high, at 95.3%.\n\nWe also capitalised on strong investment demand for o/ffice assets, with \u00a30.4bn of disposals at an average yield of 4.1%. This was in line with our strategy of selling mature o/ffice assets to invest in growth opportunities.\n\nAnd we unlocked 507,000 sq ft of potential new schemes, at New Street Square, EC4 and in Southwark, through two innovative deals. This has increased our potential future development pipeline to 1.8 million sq ft.\n\n## Major retail destinations\n\nDuring the year, we restructured and strengthened our retail team to focus on supporting brand and guest relationships, and building on opportunities to create a best-in-class portfolio of major UK retail destinations. We are seeing the results of this work, with \u00a329m of lettings signed or in solicitors' hands, on average 2% ahead of ERV.\n\nWe acquired an additional 18.75% stake in Bluewater, Kent for \u00a3126m 1 , capitalising on the opportunity to invest in one of the UK's leading retail destinations at an attractive 8.15% initial yield.\n\n## Operational review\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nDemonstrating growth in action, we grew our mixed-use pipeline by c. 50% to c. \u00a34bn total development cost through two acquisitions, with planned investment of c. \u00a31.5bn over the next /five years expected to deliver a return of c. \u00a3350m.\n\nWe acquired U+I for \u00a3269m 2 , providing access to /five mixed-use projects in London, Manchester and Cambridge, with the potential to invest c. \u00a3400m-\u00a3600m over the next /five years.\n\nWe also acquired a 75% stake in MediaCity, Greater Manchester, for \u00a3426m 1 , providing a combination of long-term income at an attractive 5.8% yield, and \u00a3400m+ of mixeduse development potential.\n\n- 1.

Last spring the UK was still in lockdown, with retail largely closed and most o/ffice sta/ff working from home, including most of our Landsec colleagues. However, since restrictions have been lifted it has been very good to see people return to our buildings. It is clear from the data we get across our estate that in o/ffices, retail and hospitality many people are keen to spend time with others again.\n\ntransition Dear shareholder\n\n'The challenges of the last years have shown the importance of our strong corporate culture which underpins our performance.'\n\nOverall I am pleased with how Landsec has performed over the year, with strong revenue growth and real progress made in evolving our asset base. The Board is proposing a /final dividend of 13.0 pence, meaning a total dividend for the year of 37.0 pence up 37%.\n\nThere are undoubtedly di/fferent patterns of behaviour evolving as people return to a more normal life, and as a business we are spending a lot of time analysing what our customers and stakeholders will want in a 'post-pandemic' world. In our own business we have seen strong momentum in colleagues returning to the o/ffice, and can already see the bene/fits in collaboration, wellbeing and productivity that sharing physical space brings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Progressing our strategy\n\nIn my letter to you last year, I covered the strategic review that we had undertaken following Mark's arrival. Over the course of this year, we have made signi/ficant progress in implementing our strategy.\n\nIn central London we continue to focus on curating our portfolio, developing new best-in-class assets and recycling capital through disposals where appropriate. Despite operational and cost challenges we continue to make good progress on site, including at 21 Moor/fields, EC2 in the City, which is nearing completion. Where we are developing on a speculative basis (for example at Lucent) we are focused on leasing up to the best tenants. We have also made good progress on our disposals, Harbour Exchange, EC14 and 32-50 Strand, WC2.\n\nThe pandemic has of course shifted consumer behaviour. While the value of all retail and hospitality assets has been hit, values for high-quality assets like those in our portfolio are recovering, and we have robust, customer-facing plans for all our major assets going forward. We have strengthened our retail team by recruiting external expertise to make us more responsive to what customers and consumers will want.\n\nOur acquisitions of MediaCity and U+I have been an exciting step change in growing our mixed-use business, which we highlighted as an important strand of our new strategy last year. It has also shifted our portfolio balance slightly away from London, especially to Manchester which we see as having exciting value potential. The Board has been actively involved in planning the integration of U+I and we look forward to progressing the development pipeline strengthened by both acquisitions.\n\n## Our culture\n\nThe challenges of the last years have shown the importance of our strong corporate culture which underpins our performance. We continue to be proud of the resilience our business has shown, and the determination of our people to support our customers and one another through di/fficult times. As we look forward, the Board is however keen to see that our culture evolves appropriately for our future business, becoming more agile and e/ffective, and creating an environment where talented people can thrive and progress.\n\nExternal benchmarks and our employee surveys show already that our business is seen as open and inclusive, but we can make further progress here which will underpin our e/fforts to make Landsec's workforce truly representative of the communities we serve.\n\n## Our sustainability agenda\n\nWe are proud of the leadership position we have on sustainability issues in the real estate sector, but clearly recognise the challenges that our sector and our portfolio face in coming years. These challenges are at the forefront of Board discussions. We continue to make strong progress towards meeting our longer term goals in this area (see pages 44-57), and you can also see in our Remuneration report on pages 108-124 how we are embedding ESG objectives into remuneration targets.\n\n## Governance\n\nGood governance is fundamental to the long-term success of our company, and this is covered in more detail in the Governance review on pages 74-130. The composition and evolution of our Board continues to be important, and activity is focused on ensuring that we are well positioned when directors' terms come to an end. The Board continues to meet the recommendations on gender and ethnic diversity contained in both the Hampton-Alexander Review and the Parker Review.\n\nAt the start of the year we welcomed Vanessa Simms to Landsec as our new CFO. She has already brought dynamism and freshness to how we manage our business, and she is working closely with Mark to implement our strategy. As our business needs evolve, the Board is supportive of management plans to streamline our /finance and professional services functions to make them /fit for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the year, the Executive Leadership Team has also been reorganised and changed, with new joiners from outside Landsec. The Board has enjoyed hearing fresh perspectives about our business in discussions with ELT members.\n\nAlthough conditions have made it more challenging to visit our operations, we had a Board meeting in Manchester in February and visited both MediaCity and U+I assets. The Board /finds such visits very valuable, and in addition we have continued our programme of employee engagement through Non-executive Director breakfasts with colleagues and through meetings with the Employee Forum.\n\n## Outlook\n\nYour Board is pleased with the progress that our business has made over the last year, and we have strong momentum in all key strategic areas. Our /financial results re/flect how well Landsec has recovered from the challenges of the pandemic. However, we acknowledge that there are headwinds in the economic environment in the UK as we start our new /financial year; the cost of living challenges will have a serious impact on our customers and wider stakeholders, and supply chain issues and geopolitical uncertainty will add to this. We remain alert in assessing the risks this will pose to our business, and take comfort from the resilience that Landsec has already shown, the underpinning of our revenues and the prudent gearing levels we have. We will continue to recycle capital where appropriate.\n\n## Thank you\n\nTo /finish, on behalf of all the Board I would like to thank all our Landsec colleagues for all their e/fforts through a year of change. I look forward to working with them to build on our growing momentum over the coming year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCressida Hogg Chairman",

        "page_content": "expense related to Covid-19 we recognised in the prior year. We are proposing a dividend of 13.0 pence per share for the /final quarter, bringing the total dividend for the year to 37.0 pence per share.\n\nWe saw a 3.6% valuation uplift on our portfolio for the year. This re/flects our strong leasing activity in both retail and London o/ffices, with the latter driving 2.5% growth in ERVs; a number of major lease regears in London, highlighting the continued demand for high-quality o/ffice space; and upside from our pro/fitable development activity and strategic investment decisions. Positively, virtually every part of our portfolio witnessed valuation growth in the second half of the year, with retail values up 1.7%, leaving them e/ffectively /flat for the full year. With Central London values up 3.7% for the year, this gave rise to a 7.9% increase in EPRA NTA to 1,063 pence per share.\n\nAt the same time, we have made strong progress against our strategic objectives. We invested \u00a3821m in the acquisition of a 75% stake in MediaCity, U+I Group PLC and a further stake in Bluewater, providing us with a mix of attractive income returns and future development upside. This was balanced by the sale of \u00a3445m of mature or non-core assets, including the \u00a3195m disposal of 32-50 Strand post the year-end. With clear visibility on expected future returns, we anticipate further capital recycling in the year ahead, as we start to invest in the higher return opportunities in our signi/ficant pipeline. Whilst our net investment increased LTV slightly to 34.4%, we expect this to reduce slightly to around last year's level in 2023.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on three key areas/uni00A0- Central London o/ffices, major retail/uni00A0destinations and mixed-use urban neighbourhoods. Although the proportions of use di/ffer, there is increasingly more that unites these areas than divides them, as the lines between where people work, live and spend their leisure time blur. What really binds these three areas together is the importance of a sense of place.\n\nThis is evident in Central London, where 15% of our portfolio comprises non-o/ffice space. It is this wide variety of restaurants, bars and shops in or next to our o/ffices which create the vibrant places that make people want to spend time here.\n\nAcross major retail destinations, we expect c. 25% of space will not be retail in the future, as we will introduce more diverse food o/fferings, leisure and inner-city o/ffice space. Similarly, for mixed-use urban neighbourhoods, it is the blend of o/ffice, residential, restaurants, bars, shops and green space which creates the attraction of a place and ensures its enduring success.\n\nOur strategy is grounded in our purpose; Sustainable places. Connecting communities. Realising potential. We have a sustainable or attainable competitive advantage in each of our three areas of focus which will help us create long-term value for all our stakeholders. With our achievements over the past year, we now have a signi/ficant pipeline of opportunities in each area and clear visibility on the potential returns on o/ffer and risks associated with these and our existing portfolio.\n\nOur focus is to deliver on the opportunities we have created. In doing so, we continue to be guided by three things; delivering sustainably, delivering for our customers and being disciplined with our capital. Since September 2020, we have sold \u00a31.1bn of assets and over the coming years we plan to recycle a further c. \u00a33bn of mature, low-yielding London o/ffices and assets in sectors where we have limited scale, such as retail parks or hotels. As we reinvest our capital into our pipeline and selective retail acquisition opportunities, we expect delivering on our strategy to drive a meaningful increase in earnings and, on average, a mid to high single digit total return over time, whilst keeping LTV below the mid 30% level.\n\n## Central London - high-quality portfolio and unlocking of value via/uni00A0development driving returns\n\nCentral London makes up 65% of our overall portfolio by value. Of this, 56% is located in the West End, with the remainder in the City and Southwark. The quality of our investment portfolio is high; 49% of our assets have been developed over the past ten years, compared to c. 20% for the overall market, and 44% of our completed London o/ffices have an EPC rating of 'B' or higher versus 15% for the market. This is a key competitive advantage, as customers increasingly focus on /flexibility, the best quality space which o/ffers the right amenities to attract talent, and buildings which have the right sustainability credentials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is borne out by our record leasing activity, with \u00a363m of leases completed with new and existing o/ffice customers, on average 4% above valuers' assumptions, and a further \u00a36m in solicitors' hands, 13% ahead of valuers' assumptions. We are also seeing strong interest in our Myo /flexible o/ffer, which we now plan to grow from 72,000 to c. 500,000 sq ft in the next /five years. Vacancy for the overall London o/ffice market is elevated at 9.0%, but most of this is second-hand, so vacancy in our portfolio is only 4.7%. O/ffice utilisation has continued to grow, especially mid-week, as London is becoming noticeably busier.\n\nIn line with our view this time last year that prime rents would remain resilient and yields could tighten, ERVs for our Central London o/ffices rose 2.5% and equivalent yields fell 4bps to 4.6%, driven by our successful lettings including a number of major lease regears. Central London retail and other values softened in the /first half of the year, but this fully recovered in the second half, as the return to the city gathered pace. Including development, overall capital value growth in London was 3.7%. Over the next 12 months, we expect o/ffice ERVs to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage and the continued weight of capital to keep yields broadly stable, assuming bond yields do not rise materially from here.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's statement continued\n\nOur 1.0m sq ft committed pipeline is 56% pre-let, with recent evidence on rents ahead of our underwriting assumptions. We are seeing good interest in the remaining space, even though part of this will not complete for another year. Construction costs for our committed projects are 97% /fixed, but we have seen c. 5-7% cost in/flation on future schemes over the past 12 months. The upside to ERVs implied by current negotiations o/ffsets the impact this had on total development cost, which also includes land, and rising costs arguably put further pressure on the shortage of prime, sustainable space. Subject to continued demand, we could start up to three new schemes with c. \u00a31bn total development cost and an attractive 6.4% yield on cost in the next 12 months.\n\nInvestor competition for development sites remains high, so we are pleased to have been able to unlock two new development opportunities totalling 507,000 sq ft o/ff-market, one via the acquisition of U+I and the other via a major lease-regear with Deloitte at New Street Square, taking our total future pipeline to 1.8m sq ft. We sold Harbour Exchange during the period and exchanged contracts shortly after the year-end to sell 32-50 Strand, with combined proceeds of \u00a3392m re/flecting a 4.1% yield and 13% premium to the March 2021 book value. As investment demand remains strong, we expect to recycle more capital in the year ahead, in line with our plans to reduce our Central London weighting to 55-60% over time.\n\n## Major retail destinations improved/uni00A0operational performance driving growth in best locations\n\nMajor retail destinations make up 16% of our portfolio, c. 60/40% split between prime shopping centres and outlets. The pandemic accelerated the pre-existing trend of retail sales moving online, which combined with lockdowns has had a marked impact on our portfolio. However, our performance over the past year has made us increasingly con/fident that the prospects for prime retail destinations are\n\npositive, with a growing polarisation between our assets and those facing structural obsolescence.\n\nWe maintain our view there is c. 25% excess retail space across the UK, but most of this is secondary where vacancy remains high. In/flation is putting further pressure on low-margin stores, which could lead brands to accelerate the rationalisation of the tail-end of their portfolios. Conversely, prime destinations are getting stronger, with occupancy in our portfolio up 170bps to 93.2% over the year. For many leading brands, online and physical channels are now viewed as /firmly inter-connected, so we have seen existing brands upsize, new brands opening stores as they move from nearby locations to bene/fit from higher footfall, and digital-native brands opening physical stores to grow customer connectivity and experience.\n\nDuring the year, we restructured and strengthened our retail team to focus more on growing our brand relationships and enhancing guest experience and less on asset management, investing in new capability and experience from a range of global retailers to complement our existing property skills. The feedback from brand partners on this has been positive and as retail continues to become more operational, we believe this di/fferentiated approach will allow us to deliver genuine added value in the future.\n\nOur proactive approach to leasing during the pandemic, prioritising occupancy and supporting customers, is now yielding results. We signalled a year ago that after a material decline over the previous /five years, prime retail rents were approaching sustainable levels. Our results over the past year have con/firmed this, as the \u00a329m of rent signed during the year or currently in solicitors' hands is on average 2% above ERV. While lease terms are generally shorter and there is more turnover-linkage than a few years ago, incentives are down too. We expect occupancy to grow further, so despite some selective over-renting, we expect like-for-like income to be broadly\n\nstable this year, before returning to growth in the medium term. Meanwhile, like-for-like retail sales in our portfolio are now 1% above the 2019/20 pre-Covid level.\n\nThis positive performance supported a return to capital value growth, with values up 1.7% in the second half, leaving them e/ffectively /flat for the year as a whole at -0.1%. With con/fidence in the sustainability of income growing, we think yields of c. 7-8% for prime shopping centres look attractive and may well start to come in. During the year, we acquired a further 18.75% stake in Bluewater for \u00a3126m at an 8.15% initial yield and we are actively exploring new opportunities. We maintain our view that major retail destinations could grow to 20-25% of our portfolio, but as we recycle capital out of subscale sectors such as retail parks and leisure, our overall retail exposure would remain relatively stable.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods clear visibility to grow to 20-25% of/uni00A0portfolio\n\nAt our strategic review in late 2020 we set out that we saw an opportunity to materially grow our exposure to mixed-use urban neighbourhoods. Many parts of today's built environment need remodelling to make sure they are /fit for changing consumer expectations on how we live, work and spend our leisure time and the growing demands on sustainability. The latter has been a strong focus for Landsec for years, evidenced by the fact that we were the /first commercial real estate business in the world to set a science-based carbon reduction target in 2016. Combined with our extensive experience in creating thriving urban places in Central London and for example Oxford and Leeds via some of our major retail destinations, we are well positioned to deliver on the opportunity to reshape urban neighbourhoods in a sustainable way.\n\nOver the past year we have made signi/ficant progress on these mixed-use ambitions. We have grown mixed-use urban neighbourhoods to 7% of our portfolio, up from 3% a year ago and have now created a pipeline of pro/fitable development opportunities, deliverable in the near term. With potential capex of c. \u00a31.5bn, this could see mixed-use grow to 20-25% of our portfolio in the next /five years.\n\nThis marked acceleration in potential growth has been driven by our acquisitions of MediaCity and U+I in late 2021.

        "page_content": "MediaCity in Greater Manchester and the key U+I projects in London and Manchester already have planning consent, so this provides us with a clear opportunity to invest c. \u00a3800m-\u00a3900m in a combination of residential, work and leisure space across these schemes in the next /five years. The integration of the U+I team also adds strong placemaking skills to our business.\n\nCombined with our existing mixed-use opportunities in Glasgow and in Lewisham and Finchley Road in London, where we have made good progress in terms of planning during the year, we therefore now have an attractive pipeline of mixed-use projects. These provide us with the ability to adapt and, due to their diversi/fied nature, geographical spread and /flexible phasing of capex, o/ffer a balanced risk pro/file.\n\nContrary to large individual developments which are by nature binary, this means our mixed-use business should start to deliver reasonably repetitive development returns in the coming years, whilst limiting our speculative risk. Capital values were -2.8%, as some of our future projects are still being valued based on their existing retail use and we are shortening leases to create future /flexibility. Overall, we expect ungeared development IRRs to be in the low teens, with attractive longer-term income return and rental growth potential as we grow our mixed-use portfolio. We envisage starting on-site with the /first phase of May/field, Manchester later this year and at MediaCity and, subject to planning, Finchley Road next year.\n\n## Creating a more agile, customerfocused and e/fficient culture\n\nOur positive performance and strategic progress over the year re/flect the capability and commitment of our people, who have continued to deliver despite the challenging operating environment during the /first part of the year in particular. Changing the culture of our business is key to getting the most out of the substantial talent within Landsec and successfully delivering on our strategy in the long term. Whilst our progress to date means we have already become more agile, more customerfocused and better placed to respond to changes in external market conditions, there is more to do to ensure we deliver on potential opportunities in an e/fficient and e/ffective way.\n\n## Building on our leading position on/uni00A0sustainability\n\nSustainability has been at the heart of Landsec for years and has become a key decision driver for many of our customers. To guide our sustainability initiatives, we recently launched our new Build well, Live well, Act well framework, which creates a clear link with our purpose - Sustainable places. Connecting communities. Realising potential - and sets ambitious targets on how we operate. For example, we have now set a target to reduce embodied carbon for our o/ffice developments by 50% by 2030, to below 500kgCO 2 e/sqm, as part of our Build well ambitions; to focus our e/fforts on improving social mobility by supporting 30,000 people towards the world of work by 2030 as part of our Live well programme; and to link the remuneration of our people to our sustainability targets as part of our Act well pillar.\n\nTo ensure we remain at the forefront of everything the sector is doing to tackle the climate crisis, we were the /first UK REIT to publish a net zero transition investment plan last year. This will see us invest \u00a3135m in our existing portfolio by 2030, optimising building management systems, installing air source heat pumps and increasing renewable capacity. This will ensure we deliver our 70% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 versus the 2013/14 baseline and stay ahead of the Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standards Regulation, which require an EPC 'B' certi/fication by 2030, as well as other regulatory requirements.\n\nDuring the year, we achieved a 20.7% reduction in embodied carbon across our development pipeline, re/flecting amongst others the use of steel with a greater recycled content at 21 Moor/fields. We saw an 18% reduction in energy intensity compared to 2020, although this partly re/flects the lower utilisation of space, especially during the /first part of the year. In London, 44% of our o/ffice portfolio is already rated EPC 'B' or higher versus c. 15% for the wider UK o/ffice market, which given the growing occupier focus on sustainability, underpins the good demand and positive rental value growth we are seeing.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe recent surge in geopolitical risk has the potential to upend decades of relative international stability and increasing globalisation, which is adding further\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndisruption to global supply chains already a/ffected by the pandemic. It also is putting signi/ficant upward pressure on energy costs in the short term, and potentially in the long term through an accelerated energy transition. This clearly creates uncertainty around the economic outlook, with gilt yields having risen to the highest level in six years and UK in/flation at its highest level in 30 years - something which will be felt by many in the months ahead.\n\nWhilst we are alive to the risks this creates, we look forward to the future with con/fidence. In London, we o/ffer high-quality, sustainable o/ffice space in places people want to visit and o/ffice yields are well above other key European cities, o/ffering some cushion against rising interest rates; in retail, improved demand for space is supporting income and valuation growth; and in mixed-use we now have an attractive pipeline of opportunities. Across central London and mixed-use, we now have the opportunity to invest c. \u00a32.8bn in capex over the next /five years which could deliver c. 20% pro/fit on total development cost, although we have /flexibility about any future commitments. Meanwhile, with an LTV of 34.4% and only 18% of our drawn debt maturing in the next three years, our capital base remains strong.\n\nDespite the macroeconomic challenges, we therefore remain con/fident that delivering on our strategy will allow us to deliver, on average, a mid to high single digit annual return on equity over time. Our strategy of recycling capital out of mature London o/ffices and subscale sectors into our London and mixed-use pipeline has the potential to deliver c. \u00a3120m growth in rental income over time, whilst keeping our LTV at the low 30% level. We expect the impact of this on EPS growth to be relatively balanced over the coming years, as we balance new investment with disposals. For the current year, making some allowance for our planned capital recycling, we expect continued operational performance to drive EPRA EPS growth in the low to mid single digit percent range, supporting further growth in dividends.\n\nMark Allan Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Market context\n\nThe Landsec property portfolio is invested in a number of sectors within the UK. We own highquality o/ffices in London, six regional shopping centres, /five retail outlet centres and a portfolio of mixed-use urban development opportunities in London, Manchester and Cambridge.\n\n## The UK real estate market\n\nThe real estate investable market in the UK is estimated to be valued at \u00a3594bn, with assets across a wide range of sectors including o/ffices, industrial, healthcare, retail and residential. Rather than try to invest in all areas, and spread our management focus too thinly, we specialise in three. These are: Central London o/ffices, Major retail destinations and Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods - areas where we have sources of competitive advantage and expertise, to be able to maximise the value from our portfolio.\n\n## Central London o/ffices\n\nLondon is well set to continue its position as Europe's pre-eminent global gateway city. It has a unique ecosystem that combines a rich network of world-class universities, renowned research centres, innovative small businesses and global industry players. Alongside its global reach, London's ability to attract and retain talent continues to be a competitive advantage, and its reputation as a safe haven is particularly valuable in times of turmoil.\n\nThe pandemic has changed the nature and location of work, with many existing trends materially accelerating. For many, work has moved online through adopting tech-enabled lifestyles and rearranging working patterns. The historical link between o/ffice-based employment growth and demand for o/ffice space will change as hybrid working becomes the norm.\n\nFlexible working, and the way o/ffice space is designed and used, will be important factors as employers look to attract and\n\nMarket at a glance\n\nsq ft\n\n\u00a3234m of o/ffice space in central London\n\n\u00a314.3bn of investment transactions in central\n\nLondon/uni00A0in/uni00A02022 (2021: \u00a37.2bn)\n\n9.0% vacancy rate in central London o/ffices\n\n(2021:/uni00A08.9%)\n\n19.0% shopping centre vacancy rate (2021: 17.9%)\n\n26%\n\nOnline sales as a percentage of all retail sales (as at March 2022) (March 2021: 34%)\n\nretain an engaged and motivated workforce. Creating workplaces as overt displays of a company's culture, and places that facilitate the bene/fits of collaborating in person, will stimulate creativity and, ultimately, productivity. We expect this trend to continue, alongside the growing requirement to ensure o/ffices meet the minimum credentials for sustainability by 2030. These conditions lend themselves to a potential divergence of the central London o/ffice market as better-quality assets become even more appealing to many customers. This resonates with the three pillars of our 'future o/ffice' proposition: partnership, experience, and healthy and sustainable spaces.\n\nIt is still too early to draw /firm conclusions on how the o/ffice market will evolve, but market activity in the last 12 months has been encouraging. Both the occupational and investment markets have rebounded from their respective 2020 lows - the take-up of o/ffice space is up 135% and the level of investment up 101%, with activity rising in the last six months.\n\n## Major retail destinations\n\nRetail has been through a period of signi/ficant change during approximately the last /five years, both in the UK and worldwide. The rise in share of UK online retail, from 16% /five years ago to 26% today, has been one of the main reasons for this change. Its growth has been fuelled by a rapid increase in smartphone use, advances in technology, improvements in supply chains, a shortening of delivery times and, more recently, the change in consumer habits caused by the pandemic.",

        "page_content": "However, online growth is not the only change. Many other factors are adding to the pressure on retailers - changing consumer demands, excessive debt burden on private-equity-owned retailers, underinvestment by brands, over-expansion that has caused saturation in certain submarkets, and the rising costs in wages and supply chains. Most of these were apparent before Covid-19, but have been exacerbated by the additional challenges it brought. This has resulted in company failures for those with the weakest business models.\n\nBut physical retail is not dead. There is clear consumer demand for shopping centres with an attractive mix of retail, leisure and hospitality, but all these elements must be present for shopping centres to thrive. And brand partners with omnichannel strategies are looking for the right space to support their online businesses. Typically this means operating a smaller number of larger stores, in regionally-dominant shopping centres.\n\nShopping centres will become much more operational assets, with shorter lease terms, higher brand rotation, and more linkage of rental income to turnover, to share in brands' performance. This has been a successful model for retail outlets for decades, as a more proactive brand rotation that focuses\n\n## Central London o/ffice vacant space Source: CBRE, Landsec\n\non the best performers has historically grown sales at a higher rate than the overall market. We expect shopping centres to move in a similar direction, although we do not expect an identical model, given the di/fferent nature of the brand o/ffer.\n\nAs visibility on income stabilisation becomes clearer and bank lending starts to become available again, we expect investment activity to continue to grow. Given the high yield premium compared to other markets and sectors, we believe UK shopping centres could see material yield compression as a result. This provides a cyclical investment opportunity, as there are few investors with both the capital and operational expertise required.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nWe previously identi/fied urban mixed-use as an opportunity area for Landsec. The varied potential uses are supported by long-term trends, and our scale, existing pipeline and ability to complete complex schemes mean we are well placed to become a leading player in this market.\n\nThe concept of individual localities (or even potentially buildings) being reserved for a single use is weakening, and there is an increasing desire to see a mix of living,\n\nworking and leisure within distinct neighbourhoods. The appeal of this has further strengthened during the pandemic and we expected it to be sustained, with convenience being a key motivation in a society where time is an increasingly precious commodity.\n\nIn addition, quality of life, health, wellbeing and environmental sustainability are all important themes, and political and societal awareness of these factors has increased considerably in recent times. Done well, mixed-use urban communities can achieve strong returns, as the appeal of the location and amenity increases values across phases of development - known as placemaking.\n\nAt the same time, certain areas of cities are rapidly becoming redundant and in need of regeneration. There is increasing political will behind redevelopment projects, but they are complex and there are very few developers with the scale and skills required.\n\nFrom this perspective, developing strong public sector partnerships is critical to success. Not only are they political stakeholders, but in many cases their participation will be key to accessing development land - with U+I's May/field project in Manchester a case in point.\n\nCentral London o/ffice market - /floor space under o/ffer Source: CBRE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart 2\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rather than trying to invest in - and spread our management time across - all areas, we focus on three where we have sources of competitive advantage and can maximise the value from our portfolio and our talent.\n\nThese areas are: Central London o/ffices; Major retail destinations; and Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods. What binds these three areas together is the importance of a sense of place to their enduring success, and to that of their surrounding areas. We strive to create, curate and activate places that inspire people, generating value for all our stakeholders.\n\nTo achieve our strategy successfully, we need a clear sense of purpose and a culture that supports, respects and motivates our people. The three - strategy, purpose, culture - are inextricably linked.\n\nWhile our strategy is grounded in this central purpose, it is vital we make healthy, sustainable returns to enable our business to grow over time. Which is why we focus on those areas where we believe we have a genuine competitive edge.\n\nWe are a total-return business. In the current environment, our aim is to achieve mid to high single-digit annual returns on equity through the cycle, split almost equally between income and growth.

Demand for our high-quality, sustainable o/ffice space is healthy, and this part of the portfolio can o/ffer a blend of returns; from high-quality, low-risk income, through to pro/fits from new development.\n\n## MAJOR RETAIL DESTINATIONS\n\nIn retail, we own and manage highquality, major retail destinations that o/ffer something special to brands and shoppers alike, in an increasingly omnichannel world. Shoppers are attracted to places that o/ffer experiences they can't easily get elsewhere; brands are drawn to places where they can showcase their o/ffer to a high number of shoppers. Our job is to bring the two together. Our high-quality portfolio, strong brand partner relationships and deep understanding of shoppers give us a real competitive edge.\n\n## MIXED/hyphen.caseUSE URBAN NEIGHBOURHOODS\n\nOur focus on developing and investing in mixed-use urban neighbourhoods recognises that the lines between where we live, work and spend our leisure time are becoming increasingly blurred. This is creating an urgent need to reshape our cities so they are /fit for the future. We are using our scale, expertise and experience to help adapt the built environment to meet people's changing needs. These projects take shape over a number of years and multiple phases, meaning each project can o/ffer an attractive blend of income, growth and development-led returns over several years. Importantly, the phased nature of these projects means we can realise returns in stages, rather than wait for the overall completion of the project.\n\nAt our Capital Markets Day (CMD) in October 2020, we set out plans to recycle approximately \u00a34bn of capital out of mature properties and those in 'subscale' markets. This was made up of c. \u00a32.5bn of long-let London o/ffices with limited asset management, and our \u00a31.5bn portfolio of hotels, retail parks and leisure assets, where we have neither the scale nor the sources of competitive advantage to achieve our target returns.\n\nAt the CMD, we also set out our plans for reinvesting the proceeds from these disposals: investing in London o/ffice development and mixed-use urban schemes where the potential returns are attractive.\n\nWe have made signi/ficant progress with our strategy over the last 18 months. We have sold c. \u00a31.1bn of assets and invested \u00a3695m in mixed-use urban opportunities through the acquisition of U+I Group PLC and a 75% share of MediaCity UK in Manchester. We have also invested \u00a3680m in our existing London development programme and the acquisition of a further 18.75% stake in Bluewater. The charts below show the progress we have made towards rebalancing our portfolio to focus on sectors with high-growth potential. With development potential in the portfolio now totalling c.\u00a33bn, we have a clear path to achieving this rebalancing over the next /five years or so.\n\nIn executing our strategy we are guided by three things: developing sustainably, succeeding for our customers and being disciplined with our capital. The built environment accounts for 40% of carbon emissions globally, so everything we do needs to have sustainability at its heart.\n\nIn 2016, we were the /first commercial real estate business in the world to set a sciencebased carbon reduction target and, in 2019, we increased our ambition to align with a 1.5-degree global warming scenario.\n\nDuring this year, we announced a new net zero transition investment plan across our entire estate. This will ensure we remain at the forefront of everything the property sector is doing to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nAt the heart of our philosophy is a belief that we can only be successful if our customers are successful. We look to build positive and lasting relationships with them, to understand their businesses better, and determine what we can do better or di/fferently to help them succeed.\n\nWe think constantly and very carefully about where to invest, focusing in particular on projected returns and the associated risks. With visibility and expertise across three distinct focus areas, we have a unique perspective on relative risk and returns, which enables us to be clear and decisive in our capital allocation decisions.\n\n## Our strategy's impact on portfolio weighting (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Portfolio split           | March 2021   | March 2022   | Medium term   |\n|---------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Central London            | 69%          | 65%          | 55-60%        |\n| Major retail destinations | 16%          | 16%          | 20-25%        |\n| Urban mixed-use           | 3%           | 7%           | 20-25%        |\n| Subscale sectors          | 12%          | 12%          | N/A           |",

Customers want /flexible options and strong sustainability credentials - so only the best space will thrive. Our portfolio is well placed to bene/fit from these trends.\n\nIf overall demand recovers strongly, the highest-quality space could see strong rental growth due to relative scarcity of supply. The weight of capital globally, and relative a/ffordability of London, is supporting strong investor demand for the best space. We see a potentially strong market to address with our pipeline of developments, but pricing will make it di/fficult to acquire further development sites in the near future.\n\n## Our plan for our Central London portfolio\n\nWe will recycle capital out of assets with limited shorter-term prospects, taking advantage of strong pricing, to fund investment in growth opportunities across the Group. We sold Harbour Exchange and since the year-end exchanged contracts to sell 32-50 Strand for \u00a3195m.\n\nWe will complete and lease committed developments and secure planning consent for our secured medium-term projects.

We/uni00A0now have a pipeline of 1.8m sq ft of o/ffice-led development opportunities.\n\nWe will broaden the range of propositions across the portfolio so we can o/ffer our products - Myo, Customised and Blank Canvas - in more locations.

We will also add Myo to New Street Square and The Forge, SE1, our development in Southwark, which will open in the second half of this /financial year.\n\nWith ESG as a consideration, our investment in air-source heat pumps and innovative AI systems to increase e/fficiency will ensure our portfolio remains sustainable and meets the needs of our customers.\n\nStrategy in action\n\n## CUSTOMER FOCUS\n\nWe have a long-standing relationship with Deloitte at New Street Square.

One will be home to Myo, our /flexible o/ffice o/ffer, while the other has become a redevelopment opportunity that we would not have gained access to for many years.

        "page_content": "## Our strategic focus continued\n\n## Focus on retail\n\n## Our view of the market\n\nStructural change in the retail sector has been profound and was accelerated by the pandemic. Shopping centre values are down c. 65% from their peak, and rents are down c. 40%. The UK has an over supply of physical retail space, with perhaps 25% of it likely to convert to other uses over the next /five years. But physical retail is not dead. There is clear demand from guests for shopping centres with a great mix of retail, leisure and hospitality, but shopping centres need all three elements to thrive. And brand partners' omnichannel strategies are looking for the right space to support their online businesses. Typically, this means a smaller number of larger stores, in regionally-dominant shopping centres.\n\nThere are clear signs of rents and values stabilising, but landlords will bear more operational risk - shorter lease terms, linked to turnover. But with yields at c. 7.5% to 8% for prime shopping centres, we see opportunities to invest in the small number of centres that meet the criteria\n\noutlined above.\n\n## Our plan for our retail portfolio\n\nWe will concentrate on catchmentdominant locations we are con/fident will be long-term winners, by o/ffering an experience that draws shoppers time and again. We will sell assets where we do not have scale or sources of competitive advantage: the retail parks from our subscale sector, for example. We will also make selective disposals and acquisitions, to ensure our portfolio always holds retail assets with long-term appeal to brand partners and guests. In the last year, we have made progress with our strategy by selling two retail parks and acquiring\n\na further stake in Bluewater, Kent.\n\nWe will also invest in our portfolio. Some of our centres are too large, and we will replace some retail space with other o/ffers such as leisure, food and beverage. Other centres may be the right size, but need some investment to /fine-tune the\n\ncon/figuration or mix of uses. On average, we will look to invest the capital equivalent to 10% of current asset values to ensure our centres are /fit for the future.\n\nDuring the last year, we also restructured our retail team. We now have teams dedicated to our brand partners, our guests and guest experience, and our portfolio. This helps us better respond to and anticipate our customers' needs. All property companies will need to become more operational in their approach to managing their businesses, and we are con/fident we have the structure in place to achieve this.\n\nStrategy in action\n\n## A SENSE OF PLACE\n\nOur focus is clear: we are curating social spaces to o/ffer guests time well spent. Gunwharf Quays is on Portsmouth harbour, a stunning and lively location. We o/ffer a great range of brands at this outlet centre, and it is a destination in its own right. But it is more than just a retail destination: there are over 30 di/fferent places to eat and drink, and there's a cinema, bowling alley and a hotel. It's also a great place to spend the evening, with plenty of entertainment including bars and a casino. This really is a social space that provides a great environment for brand partners and guests, and it also acts as a social hub for the local community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is an increasing desire to see a mix of living, working and play within neighbourhoods, an appeal the pandemic highlighted. Quality of life, health and wellbeing, and environmental sustainability, are all themes that contribute to this, while political and societal awareness of these factors has increased considerably. Done well, these mixed-use urban communities can generate strong returns, as the appeal of the location and its amenity increases the value through phases of placemaking. At the same time, certain areas of our cities are rapidly becoming redundant and in need of regeneration. There is increasing political support for such projects, but very few developers with the scale and skills to take them on.\n\n## Our plan for our mixed-use urban neighbourhoods portfolio\n\nThe acquisition of U+I and the 75% share of MediaCity has expanded our development pipeline and accelerated the potential returns from this part of our strategy. Our near-term programme consists of /five schemes which total 9m sq ft and include 7,000 homes. Two are in suburban London, two are in Manchester, and one in Glasgow. In Manchester, we will be able to start on site at May/field later this year and MediaCity next year. Our schemes in London are still subject to planning approval, with earliest starts on site of 2023 and 2024 for O2 Finchley Road and Lewisham respectively.\n\nThe multi-phase nature of these projects allows us to ration capital e/ffectively and adjust our strategy over time. They are lower risk than a large, single-phase development such as an o/ffice. In addition to managing risk, the multi-phase nature also accelerates the returns from these schemes. When a phase is complete, it can start to generate income - each phase can then be retained as an income-generating asset, or can be sold, realising value and releasing capital to be deployed elsewhere.\n\nStrategy in action\n\n## O2 FINCHLEY ROAD\n\nThe O2 Finchley Road includes a shopping centre, a large surface-level car park and a DIY store. The site is ideally located for development into a mixed-use neighbourhood as its local infrastructure includes two tube and two overground stations within walking distance. We submitted plans this year for a three-phased scheme of 1,800 homes, 180,000 sq ft of commercial space and 7.5 acres of public space and park. Work will start on the /first phase in 2023, subject to planning, with earliest completion in the /first quarter of 2026.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We expect mixed-use urban neighbourhoods to grow to 20-25% of our portfolio, as we build out our current pipeline. We envisage major retail destinations could grow to 20-25% as well, although this would leave our overall retail exposure largely stable, as we plan to trade out of subscale retail park and leisure assets over time.\n\n## Investment activity\n\nWe have made good progress on our objective to reposition our portfolio towards future growth. At the time of our Strategic Review in late 2020, we said we intended to sell c. \u00a34bn of mature London o/ffice assets and assets in sectors which were sub-scale over the next six years. To date, we have sold \u00a31.1bn of assets, which means we are well on track versus this target. Whilst our initial focus in late 2020 and early 2021 had been on disposals, over the past year we switched our attention to acquisitions.\n\nOur largest deal this year was the acquisition of a 75% stake in MediaCity in Salford, Greater Manchester for \u00a3426m, Europe's largest purpose built tech and media hub. The existing estate covers 1.7m sq ft of o/ffices, studios, residential, leisure and retail space and is 96% let with a 10-year WAULT. It provides an attractive 5.8% initial yield and over half of the income is RPI-linked. There is consent to develop a further 1.7m sq ft of residential and commercial space, so we expect to invest a further \u00a3400m+ in developing this over the medium term.\n\nOur second major acquisition was of U+I Group PLC, which we acquired for \u00a3269m (including \u00a383m of net debt). This provides us with access to /five large development projects in London, Manchester and Cambridge. Three of these already have consent, the largest of which is May/field; a 24-acre site next to Piccadilly station in Manchester with the potential to deliver 2.5m sq ft of residential and commercial",

We plan to sell c. \u00a3190-210m of U+I's non-core assets over the next two years, leaving an attractive in-price for the core projects of c. \u00a360-75m, and we have already sold or exchanged contracts to sell \u00a361m of non-core assets, 10% above book value.\n\nAside from these two urban mixed-use opportunities deals, we also acquired an additional 25% stake in Bluewater shopping centre for \u00a3168m, re/flecting an attractive 8.15% initial yield, in line with our strategy to grow exposure to major retail destinations. We subsequently sold 25% of this stake to our existing JV partner M&G at the same valuation, which means our overall interest in the centre increased from 30% to 48.75%. We also agreed the \u00a360m forward purchase of the 77,000 sq ft Oval Works, SE11 o/ffice development, which o/ffers potential for our Myo /flexible o/ffice brand.\n\nIn terms of disposals, we sold Harbour Exchange, E14 for \u00a3197m, re/flecting a 11% premium to the March 2021 book value and a 3.99% initial yield. This was a mature asset that o/ffered little further upside, being a fully let 1980's building with a WAULT of 19.7 years. We also sold two small retail parks for a combined \u00a353m, representing a 15% premium to book value. Shortly after the year-end, we exchanged contracts to sell 32-50 Strand, WC2 for \u00a3195m, representing a 15% premium to the March 2021 book value and a 4.2% yield, which following a regear\n\nOur Central London portfolio value was up 3.7%. O/ffice ERVs were up 2.5%, including 4.0% growth in West End ERVs driven by our strong letting activity in Victoria. Yields compressed slightly, principally driven by a number of signi/ficant lease-regears, in particular with our second-largest tenant Deloitte, who regeared the lease of their global HQ at New Street Square, EC4 for 15 years, in a deal which also saw us free up a 170,000 sq ft 1970's building for future development. Our development activity contributed positively to the valuation, principally due to 21 Moor/fields, EC2 which is fully pre-let and set to complete later this year. Central London retail and other values softened during the /first half, but this fully recovered in the second half of the year with a 5.3% increase as footfall and leasing activity started to recover.\n\nOur retail portfolio was up 1.7% in the second half of the year, leaving it virtually /flat for the full year. Shopping centre values increased 2.5% in the second half, leaving them down 1.3% for the year as a whole, whilst outlets were up 1.6% for the year. Rental values were down 0.9% for the year and up 0.4% in the second half, supported by the our strong leasing activity, on average 2% ahead of ERV. Yields compressed slightly in the second half, broadly o/ffsetting a minor softening in the /first half.\n\nwith the sole o/ffice occupier in August, was relatively mature as well.\n\nLooking ahead, we expect to make further progress on our portfolio repositioning over the next 12 months. We are in active discussions on further disposals in central London and we continue to monitor the best timing to monetise our subscale assets, as values continue to grow, as expected. The signi/ficant potential in our development pipeline means we will be selective in terms of acquisitions, although we could see some potential attractive opportunities emerging in retail.\n\n## Portfolio valuation\n\nInvestment volumes in our key sectors increased materially over the year. Transaction volumes in London o/ffices doubled to \u00a314.3bn, close to the long-term average and following a dearth of investment during the pandemic, retail investment increased to the highest level since 2017. Initially this was mostly focused on retail parks and supermarkets, but recently demand has started to spread to shopping centres. Against this backdrop our portfolio increased in value by 3.6% over the year, including a 2.9% increase in the second half of the year with positive valuation growth across virtually all segments in the second half. Our current portfolio valuation fully re/flects the costs required to achieve an EPC rating of 'B' by 2030.\n\n| Valuation analysis       | Market value  /three.tf/one.tf March

        "page_content": "## Operating and portfolio review continued\n\nThe value of our completed mixed-use assets at MediaCity increased 2.0%, but the value of our overall mixed-use urban neighbourhoods portfolio reduced 2.8%, as future development assets were down 6.5%. The majority of these are still valued based on their existing retail use and as we prepare these assets for redevelopment, we are deliberately moving income to shorter lease terms to create future /flexibility. This weighs on valuations in the short term, but does not re/flect any potential future development upside.\n\nThis time last year we said we expected the value of our subscale assets to recover from the impact of the pandemic and that we therefore did not plan to sell these in the short term. This decision has clearly been vindicated, as the value of our subscale assets increased by \u00a3170m. Hotel values were up 3.5%, as occupancy improved post the end of lockdown restrictions, whilst leisure assets were up 7.4%, partly re/flecting two signi/ficant lease regears. Meanwhile, retail park values increased a marked 31.9%, with 187bps of yield compression, driven by a strong recovery in investment demand.\n\nLooking ahead, there remains a signi/ficant amount of capital targeting investment in London o/ffices, with yields o/ffering a premium compared to other key European markets. Assuming bond yields do not rise materially from here, we therefore expect this weight of capital to keep yields broadly stable over the next 12 months and we anticipate ERVs to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage. Despite the headwinds to consumers of rising in/flation, we expect that the growing recognition that income has stabilised post the pandemic will increase investor demand for retail and could drive shopping centre yields down from their current all-time highs. We expect to see further growth in the value of subscale assets, driven by further operational improvement in hotels and strong investor demand for retail parks.\n\n## Leasing and operational performance\n\nOccupational demand improved markedly across our main markets over the past year. In Central London, o/ffice take-up increased\n\nto 10.6m sq ft, which was up 135% versus the prior year. Demand continued to build during the period, with activity in Q1 22 in line with the 10-year /first quarter average, and space under o/ffer is at 3.9m sq ft ahead of the 3.3m sq ft 10-year average. Overall market vacancy remains elevated at 9.0%, although 83% of this is secondhand space, much of which does not necessarily /fit today's customer and sustainability requirements, and most of this is concentrated in the City, with West End vacancy at a more modest 4.6%. Following the end of lockdown restrictions, demand for retail space in prime locations has grown, although there remains a surplus of secondary space in the wider market. With this as a backdrop, we have delivered a record year in terms of leasing volumes.\n\n## Central London\n\nIn Central London, we signed 21 o/ffice lettings or renewals totalling a record \u00a363m of rent, demonstrating strong demand for space. This includes a deal with Deloitte at New Street Square, who agreed a new 15 year lease on 478,000 sq ft of space via a lease restructuring that saw us get access to Hill House, EC4, a 170,000 sq ft 1970s building, creating a future redevelopment opportunity and a signi/ficant value uplift across the overall New Street Square estate. Other major lettings included a 100,000 sq ft regear with Bain & Company at the Strand, a 97,000 sq ft lease renewal with Wellington Management at 80 Victoria Street, and a 77,000 sq ft lease renewal with consultancy /firm Alix Partners at 6 New Street Square.\n\nOn a net e/ffective basis, o/ffice lettings were 4% ahead of valuers' assumptions and we have a further \u00a36m of deals in solicitors' hands, 13% above valuers' estimates. Vacancy in our o/ffice portfolio remains well below the market average at 4.7%, re/flecting the high quality of our assets. This is slightly higher than the 3.3% this time last year, partly due to the completion of Dashwood House, EC2, which added c. 40 bps and a slight increase in vacancy in our City assets.\n\nLeasing in Central London retail and other picked up as footfall started to recover, with people returning to the o/ffice and tourism growing. The increase in vacancy during the year was principally driven by two lease surrenders we agreed at Piccadilly Lights, W1 as we are working on new opportunities for this prime space in conjunction with our adjacent Lucent development.\n\nLooking ahead, we continue to see good demand for high-quality o/ffice space across the three products we o/ffer, Blank Canvas, Customised and Myo, with current negotiations on rents on average ahead of ERV. Our /flexible o/fferings, Customised and Myo, now cover 104,000 sq ft across three locations. Our fully serviced o/ffer Myo comprises 72,000 sq ft of this and is 98% let at 123 Victoria Street and 64% at Dashwood, which opened during the year and remains in lease-up stage. We intend to open a further four Myo locations over the next two years, growing this to c. 237,000 sq ft.\n\n## Retail\n\nOur proactive approach to leasing in the prior year, prioritising occupancy over protecting ERV, means we reached a clear turning point in terms of occupancy and income during 2022 for our retail portfolio. We completed 228 lettings totalling \u00a320m - similar to 2019/20 - on average 2% ahead of ERV and have a further \u00a39m of lettings in solicitors' hands, on average 3% ahead of ERV. Lease terms are often shorter than a few years ago and c. 30% of our leases now have a turnover element, although overall turnover rent only makes up 11% of our retail income. Incentives have reduced as well and the growing insight in turnover provides valuable data, supporting our view that rents are broadly at sustainable levels.\n\nFor many leading brands, online and physical channels are now seen as fully inter-connected. This does not mean brands will not rationalise store footprints, as we think this could even be accelerated further with in/flation putting pressure on marginal stores. This focuses demand on prime",

        "page_content": "locations, creating further polarisation between winning destinations and those at risk of obsolescence. Although market vacancy is set to remain high, our occupancy was up 170bps to 93.2% and is expected to grow further.\n\nWe have further grown our relationships with existing customers, with several of them opening new stores in other locations, such as Zara at One New Change and St David's in Cardi/ff, Mango at Bluewater, and Decathlon at Trinity Leeds and Southside. We also worked with existing brands to increase their space in our centres, such as Laings/Patek Philippe at St David's, H&M at Trinity and Nike at Gunwharf Quays, and, in a /flight to prime, we have attracted several new brands to our assets from nearby locations, such as Nespresso and Space NK at Trinity. We signed several digital-native brands to open physical stores, such as Crep Collection Club at Bluewater and Kick Game at Trinity, and we continue to grow our food and leisure o/ffer, for example with the debut of the Formula 1 simulator experience at One New Change, Hangloose Adventure, The Real Greek and The Big Easy at Bluewater, and The Ivy Asia at St. David's.\n\nFootfall was 19.6% below pre-Covid-19 levels versus -18.5% for the UK average, but the average basket size increased. As such, like-for-like retail sales were 6.8% ahead of 2019/20 levels for outlets and down only 1.5% for shopping centres. Units in administration reduced materially to 0.5%, from 5.4% a year ago, and we have only seen two retailers entering into CVA/ restructuring plans, covering \u00a30.7m of annual rent.\n\nThis recovery in shopping centre sales to close to pre-pandemic levels is stark compared to rents which are c. 40% lower and values which are down c. 65% from their peak. Whilst we are mindful that the pent-up demand post lockdown could moderate and rising in/flation clearly provides a near-term headwind, this provides con/fidence in the sustainability of income and valuations for prime destinations.\n\nLooking forward, we expect occupancy will continue to grow this year and despite some historical over-renting, we expect like-for-like income to be stable this year, before returning to growth in the medium term. We will continue to invest in repositioning space to add more leisure, food and work space, for example in Oxford and Leeds where we are working up plans to add new /flexible o/ffice space.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nThe completed investment assets in our mixed-use portfolio solely comprise our investment in MediaCity, which we acquired in late 2021, but this element of our portfolio will grow materially in the coming years. The existing assets at MediaCity are 96% let and over half of the income is linked to RPI with caps and collars at 2-5%, guaranteeing future income growth. Our mixed-use development assets include our shopping centres in London and Glasgow but as these are held for future development, the existing income is managed on a short-term basis to maximise our /flexibility to obtain access for development.\n\n## Subscale sectors\n\nThe operational performance of our Subscale sectors improved strongly, driving a signi/ficant increase in valuation, ahead of our planned disposal in the medium term. Our Hotels which are all let to Accor are fully operational and occupancy recovered to 67% of pre-pandemic levels and reached 92% for the month of March. Across our Leisure assets, we completed 66 lettings, on average 4% ahead of ERV and we signed a number of major regears, for example with SnoZone in Yorkshire for 20 years. Retail parks have seen footfall recover fully to pre-pandemic levels and we signed 28 lettings, which supported an increase in occupancy to 96.5%.\n\n## Investing in sustainability, people/uni00A0and culture\n\nDuring 2021, we were the /first UK property company to announce a fully costed net zero carbon transition plan. This will see us invest \u00a3135m of capex in our existing portfolio by 2030 to enable us to deliver our science-based target and meet the Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard of EPC 'B' by 2030. Currently, 44% of our o/ffice portfolio is already rated 'B' or higher, which compared to 15% for the overall o/ffice market highlights the quality of our assets. Our plan also aligns our portfolio with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor energy intensity pathway for commercial buildings under a 1.5-degree global warming scenario.\n\nWe are on track to complete The Forge, SE1, which according to the UK's Green Building Council will be the UK's /first net zero o/ffice development, later this year. As part of our Build Well framework, we target to reduce embodied carbon by 50% versus a typical development by 2030, to below 500kgCO 2 e/sqm for o/ffices. This will require us to work closely with our supply chain to change ways of working, focusing, for example, on low carbon materials; smart designs with modern methods of construction; and standardised materials that can be reused at end of life, but also on the retention of existing structures.\n\n| Operational performance analysis   | Annualised  rental  income  /sterling.tfm   | Estimated  rental value /sterling.tfm   | LFL  Occupancy /one.tf %    | LFL  occupancy  change /one.tf ppt   | Table 5 WAULT /one.tf  years   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| West End o/ffices                  | /one.tf/three.tf/five.tf                    | /one.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                | /nine.tf/eight.tf./two.tf   | -/zero.tf./eight.tf                  | /six.tf./nine.tf               |\n| City o/ffices                      | /seven.tf/six.tf                            | /one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf                  | /nine.tf/one.tf./three.tf   | -/two.tf./three.tf                   | /five.tf./nine.tf              |\n| Retail and other                   | /four.tf/seven.tf                           | /five.tf/four.tf                        | /nine.tf/four.tf./two.tf    | -/two.tf./two.tf                     | /seven.tf./four.tf             |\n| Developments                       | /one.tf/zero.tf                             | /one.tf/one.tf/two.tf                   | n/a                         | n/a                                  | n/a                            |\n| Total Central London               | /two.tf/six.tf/eight.tf                     | /four.tf/one.tf/four.tf                 | /nine.tf/five.tf./one.tf    | -/one.tf./five.tf                    | /six.tf./six.tf                |\n| Shopping centres                   | /one.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                    | /one.tf/zero.tf/one.tf                  | /nine.tf/two.tf./eight.tf   | /three.tf./zero.tf                   | /four.tf./four.tf              |\n| Outlets                            | /five.tf/six.tf                             | /six.tf/one.tf                          | /nine.tf/three.tf./eight.tf | -/zero.tf./four.tf                   | /three.tf./zero.tf             |\n| Total Major retail                 | /one.tf/six.tf/four.tf                      | /one.tf/six.tf/two.tf                   | /nine.tf/three.tf./two.tf   | /one.tf./seven.tf                    | /three.tf./nine.tf             |\n| Completed investment               | /two.tf/four.tf                             | /two.tf/four.tf                         | n/a                         | n/a                                  | /one.tf/zero.tf./one.tf        |\n| Developments                       | /two.tf/nine.tf                             | /three.tf/two.tf                        | n/a                         | n/a                                  | n/a                            |\n| Total Mixed-use urban              | /five.tf/three.tf                           | /five.tf/six.tf                         | n/a                         | n/a                                  | /one.tf/zero.tf./one.tf        |\n| Leisure                            | /four.tf/nine.tf                            | /five.tf/one.tf                         | /nine.tf/six.tf./five.tf    | /two.tf./seven.tf                    | /one.tf/zero.tf./four.tf       |\n| Hotels                             | /one.tf/six.tf                              | /two.tf/five.tf                         | n/a                         | n/a                                  | /nine.tf./four.tf              |\n| Retail parks                       | /two.tf/nine.tf                             | /two.tf/nine.tf                         | /nine.tf/six.tf./five.tf    | /one.tf./five.tf                     | /four.tf./four.tf              |\n| Total Subscale sectors             | /nine.tf/four.tf                            | /one.tf/zero.tf/five.tf                 | /nine.tf/seven.tf./four.tf  | /one.tf./five.tf                     | /eight.tf./one.tf              |\n| Total Combined Portfolio           | /five.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf                   | /seven.tf/three.tf/seven.tf             | /nine.tf/five.tf./zero.tf   | -/zero.tf./one.tf                    | /six.tf./two.tf                |\n\n- /one.tf.

We will also work with our supply chain to improve social mobility where we invest.\n\nAs we invest in building a sustainable business, we are also investing in building a more agile, customer-focused culture. An example of this is the restructuring of our retail team, where we brought in experience and capabilities from international retailer backgrounds to focus more on growing brand relationships and customer experience. The ongoing integration of U+I is also focused on ensuring we preserve the unique placemaking and design capability of the team and we have made a number of leadership changes in our own team during the year. Changing the culture of our business is key to getting the most out of the substantial talent within Landsec and successfully delivering on our strategy in the long term, and whilst we have made good progress to date, we will continue to invest in this, as there is more to do.\n\n## Development pipeline\n\nCentral London\n\nWe have continued to make good progress on our committed development pipeline, despite wider market challenges from supply chain disruption and labour shortages. We have seen a small 3% increase in cost as a result during the year and a few months of delay in terms of completions. However, as 97% of costs are now /fixed and based on current levels of interest, we expect higher income will make up for the small increase in cost. As such, we expect this pipeline to deliver an attractive pro/fit on cost of over 20%.\n\nOur fully pre-let scheme at 21 Moor/fields is set to complete this autumn. We are seeing good demand across our speculative pipeline, even though completion of some of these projects is still more than one year out. Part of this space is earmarked for our Myo /flexible o/ffice product, but 12% of the remaining ERV is already pre-let and we are in active negotiations on a further 16%, ahead of expected ERVs. We anticipate to see further progress in leasing over the next six months.\n\nAfter adding Old Broad Street, EC2 to our future pipeline in late 2020, we managed to unlock two further potential development opportunities over the last 12 months, bringing our total future pipeline to 1.8m sq ft, or c. 35% of our current London o/ffice portfolio. The acquisition of U+I provided us with Liberty of Southwark, SE1 a 200,000 sq ft consented scheme two minutes walk from Borough Market and London Bridge Station, while our lease regear with Deloitte at New Street Square unlocked the opportunity to redevelop the adjacent Hill House, EC4. Given the continued strong investor competition for development sites, we are pleased to have been able to expand our potential pipeline in this 'o/ff-market' way. This will remain an objective, as we maintain capital discipline in a competitive market.\n\nAt Portland House we have reworked our plans to a redevelopment of the existing space, reducing the size of the overall scheme but maintaining more of the existing structure, which materially reduces the targeted embodied carbon of the scheme to below 400kgCO 2 e/sqm. This also mitigates the risk of further cost in/flation, as a much greater proportion of the total development cost is made up of the existing building. Combined with Timber Square, SE1 and Liberty of Southwark, we therefore now have the /flexibility to start up to three new projects this year. Whilst expected development costs are up due to higher construction costs, the impact of this has been o/ffset by growth in ERVs. The expected yield on cost therefore remains stable at 6.3%, providing an attractive c. 20% pro/fit on cost. Assuming demand and in/flation remain around current levels, we could therefore start up to three new projects this year.\n\nMixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nDuring 2021, we have made considerable progress on our strategy to grow our mixed-use opportunities. Our acquisitions of MediaCity and U+I virtually doubled our mixed-use pipeline to 9.0m sq ft and as both came with existing planning consents, they also signi/ficantly accelerated the\n\npotential delivery compared to our existing schemes, which are at earlier planning stages. We continue to closely monitor cost in/flation, which has a higher impact outside of London than in the capital due to the di/fference in land values but importantly, the growth outlook for Manchester in particular is strong and the multi-phased nature of our schemes provides optionality. Overall we continue to expect mixed-use London projects to deliver a low double digit IRR and our projects elsewhere to deliver an IRR in the low to mid teens.\n\nThe U+I scheme at May/field, next to Piccadilly station in Manchester, is a 24-acre site with planning for 1,500 homes, 1.5m sq ft of o/ffice space and 120,000 sq ft of retail/ leisure space. The site is held in a 50/50 JV between us and Transport for Greater Manchester, Manchester City Council and LCR. During the year, we completed the creation of a new 6.5-acre park and we plan to start on site with the /first phase of 316,000 sq ft of o/ffices late this year.\n\nThe next phase of MediaCity comprises a 15-acre site, with consent for c. 1,200 new homes and 637,000 sq ft o/ffice and commercial space. The site is held in a 75/25 JV between us and Peel, who developed the /first phase of this successful scheme. In the summer, we plan to submit a revised planning application for a 330,000 sq ft o/ffice building, nearly tripling the potential space of this building. With a total cost of c. \u00a3100-110m and a yield on cost of c. 7.5%, we aim to start on site with this project in Q2 2023. We also anticipate submitting a revised outline planning application for the entire remaining site later this year.\n\nAt Finchley Road, NW3 we submitted a planning application for a new pedestrianised, sustainable neighbourhood of c. 1,800 homes and 180,000 sq ft of retail, leisure and other space. 35% of homes are a/ffordable and public open space makes up 50% of this 14-acre site. We have made good progress on our vacant possession strategy and, subject to planning, we aim to start the /first phase in late 2023.",

Our plans for this 9-acre site comprise c. 300 homes and 1.4m sq ft of retail, o/ffice, cultural and community space. We are in constructive dialogue with the Council and the Scottish Government, who are both supportive of our plans, and we have further progressed our VP strategy during the year, building /flexibility for a potential start on site in 2024.\n\nIn Lewisham, SE13 we started public consultation on the proposed redevelopment of this 13-acre site, with potential for c. 2,200\n\nhomes and c. 275,000 sq ft of retail, leisure and o/ffice space. We acquired a 46,000 sq ft site on the high street as part of our site assembly strategy and are working closely with the Council on activating the existing 1970's shopping centre for the local community in the near term.\n\nThis pipeline of projects provides an attractive balance of income, development upside and medium-term growth potential. The ability to phase investments across various projects means we have the opportunity to create a relatively repetitive stream of development returns over the\n\n| Committed development pipeline

An alternative performance measure. The Group uses a number of /financial measures to assess and explain its performance, some of which are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not de/fined under IFRS. For further details, see table 80 in the Additional information.\n\nPRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n## Overview\n\nOur /financial performance for the year has been positive, re/flecting a strong recovery from the pandemic. Our total accounting return was 10.5% driven by the growth in value of our portfolio we delivered and a material increase in EPRA earnings. The latter was up 41% versus last year to \u00a3355m, primarily driven by \u00a317m growth in gross rental income and a reduction in bad and doubtful debts as trading conditions normalised post the disruption of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rent collection has normalised and for the March quarter currently stands at 96%, largely in line with pre-pandemic levels, and we have continued to collect current and historical arrears. As a result, EPRA EPS increased 42% to 48.0 pence per share.\n\nNet pro/fit before tax increased to \u00a3875m compared to a loss of \u00a31,393m in the prior year. Alongside our operational performance which supported the increase in EPRA earnings, this was primarily driven by a \u00a3409m value uplift of our Combined Portfolio, boosted by our pro/fitable capital recycling, development and leasing activity. After the dividends we paid during the year, EPRA NTA per share increased 7.9% during the year to 1,063 pence. Adjusted net debt increased from \u00a33.5bn to \u00a34.2bn due to our investment in future growth opportunities, so as a result our LTV increased slightly from 32.2% to 34.4%. As we plan to recycle further capital in the year ahead, we expect our LTV to remain below the mid 30% level. Our /financial position therefore remains strong, with an average debt maturity of 9.1 years and only 18% of our drawn borrowings mature in the next three years.\n\nRe/flecting our positive /financial performance, we are proposing a /final dividend of 13.0 pence per share, to be paid on 22 July 2022 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 17 June 2022. 100% of this will be paid as Property Income Distribution. Combined with the quarterly dividends paid for the /first three quarters, this would bring the total dividend for the year to 37.0 pence per share, up 37.0%. This is in line with our policy that dividends annually are covered 1.2 to 1.3 times by EPRA earnings.\n\n\u2192\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by/uni00A0the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these di/fferent forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a312.0bn, is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. These alternative performance measures are not de/fined under IFRS and, where appropriate, are based on best practice reporting recommendations published by EPRA.

The wider retail sector was heavily impacted by lockdowns in the prior year, but over the\n\npast 12 months there has been a material recovery in net rental income across our Major retail destinations; Mixed-use, where some of our future projects have an existing retail use; and Subscale sectors, which include our retail parks, leisure and hotels. This re/flects the improvement in occupancy\n\nwe have delivered and a sharp reduction in bad and doubtful debt provisions. Net rental income in Central London was down driven by the disposal of several mature London o/ffice assets, as we continue to recycle capital into higherreturn opportunities.\n\n| Income statement

Like-for-like gross rental income increased \u00a320m, or 4.1%, and the net impact of our investment activity was down \u00a34m, but the main driver was the reduction in bad and doubtful debt charges as trading conditions normalised post the disruption of lockdowns in the prior year. Variable rent, which includes income from hotels, Piccadilly Lights, parking and retail turnover rent, increased \u00a347m as Covid-19 restrictions reduced during the year and we expect this will continue to grow in the year ahead. Insolvencies and CVAs were minimal during the year, hence 94% of the \u00a311m reduction in income from this relates to the\n\nprevious year. We received \u00a37m of surrender premiums during the period, which we expect to reduce towards a normal level in the year ahead.\n\nOccupancy for our retail portfolio increased over the past 12 months, but the higher average vacancy versus the prior year still had a negative impact on costs for the year. We expect this drag to reduce in the year ahead, re/flecting our leasing success over the last 12 months and our expectation that occupancy will continue to grow from here. Like-for-like net direct property costs increased \u00a336m, which re/flects that our assets are fully operational again, having been closed or utilised at very low levels due\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto lockdown restrictions for a major part of the prior year. This saved c. \u00a310m of cost in the prior year, which reversed over the past year, and the prior year also bene/fited from the one-o/ff release of a \u00a34m provision. Higher void costs due to the increase in vacancy during the prior year added c. \u00a38m to direct property expenses, and was the main driver for the c. \u00a37m increase in net service charge costs over the past 12 months. We also saw an \u00a38m increase in letting fees due to the increase in our leasing activity. Overall, this meant our gross to net rent ratio for the year was 87.0%, but as void and letting costs reduce as occupancy normalises, we expect this to grow to c. 90% over the next two years.",

The customer support fund we launched at the start of the pandemic has further enhanced the relationship with our customers, with \u00a356m allocated to customers over the past two years. We\n\nhave made good progress on arrears and have collected the majority of the \u00a387m unprovided balance as of 31 March 2021, leaving only \u00a313m of this outstanding, all of which is currently under discussion following the end of the rent moratorium.\n\n| Rent collections  25 March 202/two.tf quarter  /one.tf,/two.tf   | Gross  amounts due  /two.tf/five.tf March /sterling.tfm   | Monthly  payment  terms agreed /sterling.tfm   | Net  amounts due  /two.tf/five.tf March /sterling.tfm   | Amounts  received to date /sterling.tfm   | Amounts  received to date %   | Table 11 Amounts  received March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| O/ffices                                                         | /five.tf/five.tf                                          | /one.tf                                        | /five.tf/four.tf                                        | /five.tf/four.tf                          | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf       | /nine.tf/eight.tf                                                  |\n| Rest of Central London                                           | /eight.tf                                                 | -                                              | /eight.tf                                               | /seven.tf                                 | /eight.tf/eight.tf            | /six.tf/three.tf                                                   |\n| Major retail                                                     | /one.tf/six.tf                                            | /one.tf                                        | /one.tf/five.tf                                         | /one.tf/four.tf                           | /nine.tf/three.tf             | /five.tf/eight.tf                                                  |\n| Mixed-use urban                                                  | /one.tf/three.tf                                          | -                                              | /one.tf/three.tf                                        | /one.tf/two.tf                            | /nine.tf/two.tf               | /four.tf/zero.tf                                                   |\n| Subscale sectors                                                 | /one.tf/four.tf                                           | /one.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                                        | /one.tf/two.tf                            | /nine.tf/two.tf               | /five.tf/zero.tf                                                   |\n|                                                                  | /one.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                                    | /three.tf                                      | /one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf                                | /nine.tf/nine.tf                          | /nine.tf/six.tf               | /eight.tf/one.tf                                                   |\n\n/one.tf.

Where an amount billed remains uncollected and is subsequently written o/ff, the VAT component will be recovered by the Group.\n\n## Net administrative expenses\n\nNet administrative expenses increased by \u00a34m to \u00a384m, largely driven by the U+I acquisition and one-o/ff business change activity during the year. Looking ahead, wage in/flation will impact sta/ff costs and over the next two years we expect to incur c. \u00a35m p.a. of IT and data related cost re/flecting an investment in upgrading our systems and data capability, which due to updated IFRIC accounting guidance will now be expensed instead of capitalised.\n\nHowever, we are focused on making sure our cost base is right so despite the additional costs of wage in/flation and IT, we expect overall administrative expenses to be broadly stable over the next 12 months and to reduce slightly in the year after.\n\nOur EPRA cost ratio for the past 12 months improved to 26.4%, although this number is still impacted by costs related to the disruption caused by Covid-19 during this period and the prior year. In total, we\n\nestimate this added c. 3% to 4% to the EPRA cost ratio for the year. Through a combination of income growth, a normalisation of our gross to net rent margin and a reduction in administrative expenses, we therefore still expect this to reduce towards 20% over the next 2-3 years in a phased manner.\n\n## Net /finance expenses\n\nNet interest costs reduced \u00a33m to \u00a371m, principally re/flecting a reduction in average",

        "page_content": "gross borrowings compared to the prior year. Although we expect borrowings to reduce over the next 12 months from the current level due to further capital recycling, we expect net interest costs to increase slightly this year due to the higher opening level of borrowings and the recent increase in variable rates, which impacts the 30% of our borrowings which is not /fixed or hedged. We anticipate the ratio of variable rate borrowings to reduce in the year ahead, as we expect borrowings to reduce based on continued capital recycling.\n\nNon-cash /finance income, which includes the fair value movements on derivatives, caps and hedging and which is not included in EPRA earnings, increased from a net expense of \u00a31m in the prior year to a net income of \u00a316m in the current year. This is predominantly due to the fair value movements of our interest-rate swaps as a result of the increase in interest rates over the past year.\n\n## Valuation of investment properties and pro/fit on disposals\n\nThe independent external valuation of our Combined Portfolio showed a \u00a3409m value\n\nsurplus. Aside from the strong recovery in value of assets in our Subscale sectors, which we said we would only dispose of in the medium term, the majority of this surplus was driven by our actions, re/flecting pro/fit on developments, several major lease regears in London, and growth in London o/ffice ERVs, re/flecting the positive leasing evidence we created. We also recognised \u00a36m upside from the regear of two long leases in our leisure assets, which are treated as tenant /finance leases in our /financial statements. Virtually all Covid-19 related allowances in the valuation which were introduced during 2020 have now been reversed, contributing \u00a363m to the valuation surplus for the year.\n\nWe recognised a \u00a3107m pro/fit on disposals of investment property, principally related to the sale of two retail parks for \u00a353m and the \u00a3197m sale of Harbour Exchange. On average, these disposals were 12% ahead of their March 2021 book value, but as Harbour Exchange was treated as a /finance lease in our balance sheet, the IFRS pro/fit on sale related to this was \u00a392m. As our March 2021 EPRA NTA included the fair value of this /finance lease, the impact on\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNTA and our total accounting return from this disposal was \u00a323m. We exchanged contracts to sell 32-50 Strand for \u00a3195m shortly after the year-end, 15% above the March 2021 book value, with part of this premium already re/flected in the March 2022 valuation.\n\n## IFRS pro/fit after tax\n\nSubstantially all our activity during the year was covered by UK REIT legislation, which means our tax charge for the year remained minimal. Driven by the increase in EPRA earnings and positive revaluation result, IFRS pro/fit after tax for the year was \u00a3875m, compared to a loss of \u00a31,393m in the prior period.\n\n## Total accounting return\n\nEPRA Net Tangible Assets, which principally re/flects the value of our Combined Portfolio less adjusted net debt, increased to \u00a37,888m, or 1,063p on a per share basis, marking a 7.9% increase on the prior year, including a 5.0% increase in the second half. Including dividends paid during the year, this means our total accounting return for the period increased to 10.5%.\n\n| Balance sheet /one.tf                                                              | /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Table 12 /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Combined Portfolio                                                                 | /one.tf/two.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/seven.tf                               | /one.tf/zero.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/one.tf                                       |\n| Adjusted net debt                                                                  | (/four.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf)                                   | (/three.tf,/four.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf)                                          |\n| Other net assets/(liabilities)                                                     | /five.tf/zero.tf                                                      | (/two.tf)                                                                      |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets                                                           | /seven.tf,/eight.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf                                 | /seven.tf,/three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                                            |\n| Shortfall/(excess) of fair value over net investment in /finance leases book value | /six.tf                                                               | (/nine.tf/three.tf)                                                            |\n| Other intangible asset                                                             | /two.tf                                                               | /two.tf                                                                        |\n| Fair value of interest-rate swaps                                                  | /two.tf/one.tf                                                        | /three.tf                                                                      |\n| Net assets, excluding amounts due to non-controlling interests                     | /seven.tf,/nine.tf/one.tf/seven.tf                                    | /seven.tf,/two.tf/one.tf/two.tf                                                |\n| Net assets per share                                                               | /one.tf,/zero.tf/seven.tf/zero.tfp                                    | /nine.tf/seven.tf/five.tfp                                                     |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share (diluted)                                       | /one.tf,/zero.tf/six.tf/three.tfp                                     | /nine.tf/eight.tf/five.tfp                                                     |\n| Total accounting return                                                            | /one.tf/zero.tf./five.tf%                                             | -/one.tf/five.tf./nine.tf%                                                     |\n\n- /one.tf.

Including our proportionate share of subsidiaries and joint ventures, as explained in the Presentation of /financial information above.\n\n## Net debt and LTV\n\nAdjusted net debt, which includes our share of JV borrowings, had been largely stable during the /first half of the year but increased to \u00a34,179m in the second half, principally driven by our \u00a3821m investment in the acquisitions of MediaCity, U+I and Bluewater, o/ffset in part by the \u00a3197m sale of Harbour Exchange. Capital expenditure on our Combined Portfolio was \u00a3350m, re/flecting our London o/ffice development programme,\n\nthe preparation of future developments and the investment in our current portfolio. We expect capex investment to grow, re/flecting our substantial pipeline and our net zero investment plan.\n\nThe other key elements behind the increase in net debt are set out in our statement of cash /flows and note 13 to the /financial statements, with the main movements in adjusted net debt shown\n\nbelow. A reconciliation between net debt and adjusted net debt is shown in note 21 of the /financial statements.\n\nAs a result of the increase in borrowings, our Group LTV which includes our share of JVs, increased slightly to 34.4%. This remains well within the range of 25% to 40% we target and in line with the low 30% level we said we expected for the foreseeable future. As we plan to continue to recycle further capital, we expect adjusted net debt to reduce this year and LTV to remain below the mid 30's. As a result of the transaction activity during the year, which saw disposals of assets from the Security Group and the acquisitions of MediaCity and U+I /financed by Security Group debt with the assets remaining outside Security Group, the Security Group LTV has increased to 36.4%.\n\n| Net debt and LTV          | /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Table 14 /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Net debt                  | /sterling.tf/four.tf,/two.tf/five.tf/four.tfm                         | /sterling.tf/three.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/nine.tfm                                |\n| Adjusted net debt /one.tf | /sterling.tf/four.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tfm                        | /sterling.tf/three.tf,/four.tf/eight.tf/nine.tfm                               |\n| Group LTV /one.tf         | /three.tf/four.tf./four.tf%                                           | /three.tf/two.tf./two.tf%                                                      |\n| Security Group LTV        | /three.tf/six.tf./four.tf%                                            | /three.tf/two.tf./seven.tf%                                                    |\n\n- /one.tf.

Our MTN and bank loans form part of our Security Group, which provide security on a /floating pool of assets currently valued at \u00a311.2bn. This provides /flexibility to include or exclude assets and an attractive cost of funding, with our MTN currently rated AA and AAwith a stable outlook respectively by S&P and Fitch.\n\nTo maintain capital discipline, we seek to balance investments in our pipeline or acquisitions with the disposal of assets which are mature or in sectors where we\n\nhave limited scale. This strategy allows us to grow income and our overall return on capital, whilst keeping net debt broadly stable over time. Our strong /financial position provides ample /flexibility to manage any short-term di/fferences between the timing of disposals and investment, as evidenced over the last few months.\n\nWe had \u00a31.6bn of undrawn facilities at the start of last year, which allowed us to move quickly on the acquisitions of MediaCity, U+I and Bluewater in November and December. This temporarily increased /floating debt as a proportion of net debt to 30%, but as we expect borrowings to reduce over the coming year as we recycle further capital, we expect the percentage of /floating debt to reduce towards c. 20% again.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe did not issue any new debt during the year, although we assumed some existing facilities through our acquisitions of MediaCity and U+I, part of which we repaid. This, alongside the increased utilisation of our revolving credit facilities meant that our average maturity of debt reduced to 9.1 years. Our average cost of debt for the year was 2.4%, which we expect to increase slightly in the year ahead. The fact that only 18% of our borrowings mature in the next three years provides us with a strong /financial base and mitigates our interest rate risk, whilst we retain \u00a31.1bn of headroom based on our existing facilities, providing ample /flexibility with respect to progressing developments.\n\n| Available facilities /one.tf              | /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Table 16 /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Medium Term Notes                         | /two.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/one.tf                                      | /two.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/zero.tf                                              |\n| Drawn bank debt                           | /one.tf,/five.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                                                        |\n| Outstanding commercial paper              | /four.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf                                              | /nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                                                        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                 | (/one.tf/five.tf/seven.tf)                                            | (/three.tf/one.tf)                                                             |\n| Available undrawn facilities              | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                                        | /one.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/one.tf                                                |\n| Total committed credit facilities         | /two.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf                                     | /two.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/five.tf                                               |\n| Weighted average maturity of debt         | /nine.tf./one.tf years                                                | /one.tf/one.tf./five.tf years                                                  |\n| Percentage of borrowings /fixed or hedged | /seven.tf/zero.tf%                                                    | /eight.tf/one.tf%                                                              |\n| Weighted average cost of debt             | /two.tf./four.tf%                                                     | /two.tf./three.tf%                                                             |\n\n- /one.tf.

Our culture is central to this, describing how we interact with each other, our customers and partners.\n\nAs we move to deliver on our strategy positioning ourselves to grow with purpose, the ability to attract, retain and develop our people is even more critical to the success of our business. We've acknowledged that through our transformation programmes coupled with a buoyant employment market, the risk of attracting and retaining people has increased. That's why this year, we've focused our actions on developing our culture, developing our people through new leadership programmes and continuing to enhance diversity and raise awareness of inclusive behaviours.\n\n## People and skills risks\n\nInability to attract, retain and develop the right people and skills to drive and deliver our strategic objectives, grow enterprise value and meet shareholder expectations.\n\n## Example KRIs:\n\n- \u2192 Employee turnover levels\n- \u2192 High potential employee turnover\n- \u2192 Employee engagement score\n- \u2192 Succession planning up to date\n- \u2192 Time to hire\n\nFor more information on how we are mitigating our people and skills risks please see page 64\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I)\n\nFollowing the launch of our D&I strategy in 2020, we focused our e/fforts in 2021 on embedding the strategy, incorporating D&I into the way we do things right across the business.\n\n## Intersectionality\n\nOver the past year, we have talked about improving the way our di/fferent a/ffinity groups work together, and we use the term 'intersectionality' to describe how overlapping identities a/ffect their experiences. Our a/ffinity networks bring our theme of intersectionality to life by collaborating on major network events, such as International Women's Day and Black History Month.\n\nThe networks also organise a range of virtual and in-person events to raise awareness and bring people together. Colleagues from our Diaspora, Women's and LGBT+ Networks organised events during Black History Month, both for our customers and colleagues. For the fourth consecutive year, our Hand in Hand Network supported Purple Tuesday to spread awareness for disabled people, and the LGBT+ Allies and Women's Network also teamed up to introduce all-gender toilets at our head o/ffice.\n\n## Our key achievements over the past 12 months can be seen throughout this report with some of the highlights spotlighted here:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuild and maintain a diverse workforce and talent pipeline\n\n01\n\n- \u2192 Published our ethnicity pay gap and/uni00A0associated action plan for the /first time\n- \u2192 Increased female and ethnic and/uni00A0minority representation at 'Leader level'\n\n03\n\nProvide inclusive services\n\nfor our/uni00A0customers\n\n- \u2192 Achieved Disability Con/fident Level 2 at 13 assets and Level 3 at /five of our/uni00A0sites\n\nEmbed inclusive behaviours and values into our culture\n\n02\n\n- \u2192 Updated our wellbeing support pack through a new partnership with Peppy Health to support employees and their partners through key milestones such as fertility, pregnancy, early parenthood and/uni00A0menopause\n- \u2192 Introduced a 'transitioning at work' policy and launched our gender expression toolkit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuild an inclusive employer brand\n\n04\n\n- \u2192 Achieved Stonewall Bronze Employer Award\n- \u2192 Hosted a range of diversity events with high-pro/file speakers across our o/ffice, retail and commercial spaces\n\nK E Y A C H I E V EM EN T S\n\n\u2192",

We ran our /first cohort with 16/uni00A0mentees in 2021, and we're starting our second cohort with 10 mentees this year. This is a collaboration between Landsec Women, the Diaspora Network and our sustainability team, aiming to empower more future leaders into our industry while increasing our employees' own inclusive leadership skills.\n\nFor International Women's Day 2022, we ran a series of events to celebrate and promote open conversations about gender equality. Our executive sponsor, Colette O'Shea, hosted a live Q&A with Non-Executive Director Manjiry Tamhane, who shared insights into her career path so far with members of our Landsec women's network. We also hosted Resurgo, our community partner in Camden and Hammersmith, to celebrate International Women's Day. Attendees heard from participants in Resurgo's Spear programme which supports young people facing barriers into employment and came together to celebrate the day.\n\n## LGBT+ ALLIES NETWORK\n\n## Executive sponsor - Bruce Findlay\n\nKey focus area To lead the property industry in being more inclusive for the LGBT+ community.\n\nWe led on the introduction of a gendertransition expression and identity toolkit, a 'coming out at work' intranet page, a transitioning in the workplace policy and all-gender toilets in our head o/ffice. We launched an all-employee training module on recognising and addressing LGBT+ bullying and harassment. The LGBT+ committee also received inclusion training, delivered by the trans youth charity Mermaids.\n\nWe collaborated with Diaspora on an event to draw attention to the successes and challenges of black LGBT+ experiences, and used international inclusivity dates, including Transgender Awareness Week, and Non-Binary People's Day, as opportunities to educate and engage. For LGBT History Month we also launched a UK LGBT+ history exhibition.\n\nWe continue to sponsor Freehold and Stonewall, including the Freehold 10 event - celebrating ten years of the Group's focus on LGBT+ inclusivity in real estate. We also completed our /first submission to Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index (WEI), securing a Bronze award for establishing a strong foundation of LGBT+ inclusive policies, tools and head o/ffice facilities.\n\n## HAND IN HAND NETWORK\n\n## Executive sponsor - Mark Allan\n\nKey focus area Disability and wellbeing network, supporting the wellbeing of our colleagues and customers.\n\nThe continuing e/ffects of Covid-19 once again ensured the Hand in Hand group was instrumental in supporting health and wellbeing, working with colleagues to support them through the challenges of working outside the normal o/ffice environment.\n\nThis year, outside of lockdown, we were able to promote Purple Tuesday at more of our properties, including shopping centres and commercial o/ffices. The launch was held at Piccadilly Lights and attended by Mike Adams, the CEO of Purple Organisation. Our Corporate A/ffairs Director Chris Hogwood attended for Landsec.\n\nWorking with Genius Within, who are experts in supporting neurominorities in the workplace, has allowed us to expand our support and knowledge of wider neurodiverse conditions, and this year we have focused on autism.\n\n## DIASPORA NETWORK\n\n## Executive sponsor - Chris Hogwood\n\nKey focus area Creating an inclusive organisation supportive of multicultural customers and colleagues.\n\nThis year, we worked with Involve to run a series of programmes designed to train our multicultural colleagues, open the door to both mentees and mentors from ethnic minority backgrounds, and introduce the leadership teams to training on racial inequality in the workplace and our communities.\n\nTo celebrate Black History Month, we worked with Black-owned businesses and professionals to hold three impactful events for our colleagues and customers. Our 'New Hues of Blackness' art exhibition showcased the works of Black artists in Myo Victoria Street. We also hosted two panel discussions with inspiring speakers, one focusing on 'The Intersectional Experience through a Black and LGBTQ+ Lens' in collaboration with our LGBT+ allies network and another in collaboration with the Black Business Institute on 'technologically advanced living, urbanisation and sustainability through the Black lens'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Engagement\n\nWe continued to survey our employees on a regular basis via pulse style surveys to have an up-to-date understanding of their levels of engagement. Our most recent pulse was conducted in late January 2022 showing an uptick in engagement levels to 7.3 out of 10 and a 13% increase in response rate to 72%.\n\nWe have revised our approach to formal internal communications to provide consistency and clarity to set pieces such as interim and end of year results. This ensures our strategy is clear and is supplemented by a series of more informal, topical and creative interventions to engage and inform our people on a range of initiatives, ideas and business updates.\n\nFrom the summer of 2022, we will be evolving our approach to create an Engagement Listening Loop, integrating our approach to culture, engagement and internal communications and making sure we are responding to the feedback of our people. This will begin with an externally benchmarked engagement survey which will allow us to deep dive and target actions to focus on key areas. We will complement this with pulse surveys focusing in on key engagement drivers such as Diversity & Inclusion, Learning & Development and Purpose and Culture. In addition, we will seek informal feedback to add to the range of data points giving ongoing sentiment across the business, allowing a platform to respond or make adjustments as needed.\n\n## Working /flexibly\n\nWe have adapted well to the forced period of remote working, and have sought to retain this greater /flexibility. To re/flect this, we have introduced our Working Smarter policy that, while acknowledging the critical role the o/ffice plays, encourages people to embrace /flexibility and regulate their work-life balance. This also plays an important role in attracting people to work for Landsec, as candidates increasingly ask about this.\n\n## Culture\n\nWe continued to develop our culture based on trust, empowerment and collaboration, and we regularly measure our progress. Our organisational cultural blueprint sets out our cultural aspiration while the corresponding personal blueprint articulates what we value and how we work together to create great experiences. We have recently updated both blueprints to re/flect how our culture is evolving. We've also initiated an annual culture cycle to listen, understand and communicate how we're doing, how our culture feels to our colleagues and customers, and o/ffer a range of practical tools so everyone can act and work together.\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic we ensured that our people had access to information about how they can get support. We also continue to encourage individuals to focus on their physical and mental health and continue to train our mental-health /first aiders. We have 18 trained individuals around the business to provide advice or a 'listening ear'.\n\nWe have created an information hub where people have easy information about, and access to, all our support including our employee assistance programme, our virtual GP, access to our external occupational health team, apps providing support including Unmind and Peppy Healthcare, and a wealth of external sources recommended by our networks, including documentaries, apps, webinars, podcasts and books.\n\nWe have also been leveraging our partnerships by passing on free gym sessions, posture masterclasses and sharing useful guides around pensions and /financial wellbeing to equip our people as the cost-ofliving increases start to impact. We have also given our employees access to the Peppy Health App which focuses on three key areas; fertility, new baby and menopause.\n\n## Recruitment and retention\n\nOverall our turnover rate has increased by/uni00A0approximately 10.15% over the last 12/uni00A0months, largely due to an increase in voluntary turnover of 7.21%, and a 3% increase in involuntary turnover.\n\nThe 76 people who have left on a voluntary basis were in roles that range from support to senior leader level. 40 were female, 36 were male. There are a number of factors in/fluencing that.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we come out of Covid-19, and like most other businesses, we are seeing a very active recruitment market with people taking the opportunity to change career or apply to work in a di/fferent organisation. In addition, as a business, we have also undergone a number of transformational change programmes which have impacted our turnover rate from both a voluntary and involuntary perspective.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of change, we have continued to invest in developing the skills and experience of our existing people whilst also attracting people with more diverse skills and capabilities. Over the last 12 months we have raised and approved 172 job requisitions. Of those 172 requisitions, we have /filled 46 (27%) positions with internal hires, some of which will have resulted in people moving into a higher-level role. In addition, we have promoted a further 22 people within their role.\n\n## Learning and development\n\nOur learning and development approach has evolved to align with our strategic plans and in support of organisational change.\n\nWe are building self-su/fficiency around learning, maximising our online learning platform; curating learning playlists, and highlighting pertinent learning solutions and hot topics. This has been complemented by a focus on deepening relationship e/ffectiveness and leadership and managerial capability.\n\nLeadership and Management development\n\nIn 2021 we launched our new approach to Leadership and Management development through sister programmes - Stepping into Leadership, which is aimed at those who are newer to management, and Leading with Purpose, which is for more seasoned leaders. These programmes are designed to provide the most up-to-date tools and techniques, ensure alignment with our cultural aims and develop a consistent standard of leadership through practical and relevant content. Both programmes are accredited by the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM).\n\nSo far, we have 26 successful (ILM accredited) participants with two more cohorts in progress.",

Business professionals train alongside 18-24 year old 'Future Leaders' from under-represented backgrounds to learn the 'coach approach' to leadership. In our third year with Circl, we have successfully completed four cohorts and we're starting our /fifth.\n\nWith Circl, we can combine experiential leadership training with social impact. Our employees gain meaningful and direct leadership experience by coaching their Future Leader, while gaining new perspectives from a young person from our communities. This leads to greater levels of engagement and real behavioural change, empowering all those involved and enhancing our inclusive culture at Landsec.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n869\n\ndays of training completed\n\n5,243\n\nCourses completed in total\n\nEmployees at each level of the/uni00A0business have completed learning throughout the year\n\n'It helped me become more con/fident which helped signi/ficantly with my wellbeing.

Pay gap reporting not only supports transparency it also helps us to identify the actions we need to take to address these gaps and we will be setting out further actions in our full pay gap report.\n\nOur mean gender pay gap reduced from 36.6% to 30.8% in 2022 and our median gender pay gap reduced from 29.3% to 28.7% over the same period.\n\nThis reduction in the gender pay gap is primarily due to increases in the representation of women in the upper middle pay quartile (1.7 percentage point increase) and upper pay quartile (2.9 percentage point increase) over the past 12 months. This is a result of a higher number of male leavers in the upper pay quartile than joiners and an increase in female representation at executive level.\n\nOur mean ethnicity pay gap increased from 32.7% to 36.5% in 2022 and our median ethnicity pay gap increased from 27.6% to 37.6% in the same period.\n\nOur ethnicity pay gaps have increased because the representation of ethnic minority sta/ff has increased in the lowest pay quartile and decreased in all other pay quartiles. This is due to a high proportion of ethnic minority new starters at our more junior levels - 50-70% of new starters at these levels over the past 12 months are from ethnic minority backgrounds. During the same period, we have had a higher proportion of ethnic minority sta/ff leave the business at manager level and this has decreased ethnic minority representation within these more senior roles. This points to the importance of our a/ffinity networks and the need for us to increase our focus on retention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 26\n\n|                              |                           |                              |                            |                                                 |                                                |                                                 | Table 23                            |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                              |                           |                              |                            | Quartile split (hourly rate -

We met this 11 years early, in 2019, subsequently updating it and aligning with the 1.5-degree global warming scenario, targeting a 70% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, compared to a 2013/14 baseline.\n\nThis year we have reduced operational carbon emissions by 52% and energy intensity by 34% from a 2013/14 baseline. These reductions can be partly accounted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor by the lower utilisation of space during the /first part of the year. However, we continue to implement a range of energy saving projects across our portfolio. This has included an ongoing and extensive lighting upgrade project at Bluewater in which we've replaced all lights in the mall area and car parks to LEDs with a wireless control and monitoring system.\n\nFurthermore, at several o/ffice buildings we have optimised energy-intensive chillers and minimised their usage during periods where demand for cooling is low. Recognising that optimising our existing heating, cooling and ventilation equipment is key to drive energy and carbon reductions, we've undertaken\n\nbuilding performance appraisals across our Central London portfolio uncovering opportunities for improvement.\n\nOur net zero transition investment fund\n\nTo help ensure we achieve our 2030 sciencebased target and move towards net zero, in November 2021 we established an ambitious \u00a3135m net zero transition investment plan. We will use the fund to /finance a series of initiatives over the coming eight years, to reduce our carbon footprint and improve innovation and best practice across the wider industry. We expect the programme to remove 24,000 tonnes of carbon emissions from our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With increasingly clear evidence of stronger sustainability credentials underpinning higher asset valuations and stronger operational performance, it is not only essential from an environmental perspective but an economic one, too.\n\nFrom April 2023, all properties that are let will require an EPC 'E' or above. As of 31 March 2022, 96% of our portfolio by asset value has an EPC rating between A-E. The actions we are taking to transition to net zero will ensure we meet this regulation well before the compliance deadline.\n\nThis year we've trialled predictive and self-adaptive Arti/ficial Intelligence (AI) commercial-building technology at 80-100 Victoria Street. Using deep learning and cloud-based computing, the technology optimises the building's existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which can result in up to a 40% decrease in carbon footprint as well as a reduction in HVAC energy costs of up to 25%.\n\nAlongside this plan we continue assessing and quantifying climate-related risks and the potential /financial impact, at a portfolio and asset level, for our existing assets, new developments and potential acquisitions.\n\nThis is informing our longer-term approach to managing climate risks across our portfolio.\n\nFor more details on our TCFD please see/uni00A0 pages 66-69\n\nEngaging our customers\n\nRecognising that approximately 40% of all energy consumption comes from our occupiers' use of our buildings, we launched a customer engagement programme to raise awareness, change behaviour and identify opportunities for collaborating on energy and cost savings.\n\nWorking with these customers and energy specialists we have been:\n\n- \u2192 running energy audits with data analysis and a site visit to understand data trends, anomalies and opportunities\n- \u2192 using energy-e/fficiency questionnaires for customers' employees to capture their opinions, attitudes and ideas on reducing energy\n\n## Portfolio EPC rating (by ERV)\n\n- \u2192 running interactive workshops to raise awareness of net zero carbon and discuss energy use\n- \u2192 making recommendations to improve e/fficiency.\n\nTo further raise awareness and drive energy e/fficiency we entered 80-100 Victoria Street, One New Change and New Street Square into the CUBE competition. CUBE's goal is to help landlords and their occupiers improve energy e/fficiency through gami/fication and behaviour change. Participants are ranked monthly on which building has registered the largest percentage energy reduction, measured from their own historic baseline of energy use.\n\nDesigning and developing our new\n\nschemes sustainably\n\nNearly 50% of whole life carbon emissions of a building occur before it even completes and this proportion is growing as the UK grid decarbonises.

The Forge, SE1 is the /first UK net zero commercial building constructed and operated in line with the UK Green Building Council's (UKGBC) framework de/finition for net zero buildings.\n\nWe have been developing our net zero carbon strategy for our mixed-use urban neighbourhoods, aiming to apply the same level of diligence on our residential-led projects as we do for our o/ffices. We looked at the life-cycle impact of our masterplans and set targets for embodied and operational carbon based on in-depth modelling and /financial appraisal. We are con/fident that this sets us on a path to providing climate-resilient homes that will stand the test of time.\n\nCredible carbon o/ffsetting\n\nWe recognise that despite our plans to transition to net zero, we will need to o/ffset some unavoidable remaining emissions from our development activity. We are focused on ensuring each credit is independently veri/fied, transparent and traceable meeting UKGBC and SBTi principles. As such, we've joined The Lowering of Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF), a public-private coalition, supported by governments (UK, US and Norway), that seeks to mobilise /finance to protect tropical forests at huge scale. LEAF carbon o/ffsets are veri/fied by Architecture for REDD+ Transactions (ART).\n\nAt The Forge, SE1 we're using pioneering construction methods. Having received funding from Innovate UK, we're creating the world's /first o/ffice building designed and constructed using the 'kit of parts' solution built on a Design for Manufacture and Assembly structural frame. By adopting this approach we have reduced embodied carbon emissions by over 25% compared to design stage.\n\nOnce in operation, no energy will be generated from fossil fuels, decarbonising building operation and reducing the impact on local air quality. It will also include highly e/fficient air-source heat pumps, and on-site renewable electricity from solar panels.\n\nIt is the UK's /first commercial development to have been recognised by the UKGBC as aligning with its framework de/finition of a net zero carbon building.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CREATING THE UK'S/uni00A0FIRST NET ZERO DEVELOPMENT\n\n## The /first certi/fied Design for Performance Project\n\nThis year, our Timber Square, SE1 development in Southwark achieved a 5-star Design Reviewed Target Rating, making it the UK's /first Design for Performance project to complete its independent design review. This means the project is on track to receive a 5-star NABERS Energy Rating on completion. This level of energy e/fficiency aligns with the UKGBC's 2025-2030 energy performance targets for commercial o/ffices aiming to achieve net zero carbon in operation. The partial reuse of the existing structure of the Print Building, and the use of a hybrid steel and cross-laminated timber (CLT) structure, results in an embodied carbon intensity of more than half of a typical London o/ffice.",

The results of this are helping us identify further enhancements for the sites so we can reach our 2030 target to achieve a 25% biodiversity net gain across our operational sites currently o/ffering the greatest potential. Once these are complete, we will undertake further ecology studies to identify additional ways to ensure we meet our biodiversity target.\n\nWe have a commitment to delivering signi/ficant biodiversity net gain across all of our new developments. Our scheme at the O2, Finchley Road is achieving over 150% net gain through a careful landscaping design to reintroduce nature on a site with limited vegetation and ecological value.\n\n## Using resources e/fficiently\n\nBuildings are responsible for 50% of all extracted material. We are committed to using resources e/fficiently reducing the materials we use in our development activity and sourcing them from ethical and sustainable sources, promoting reuse and circular economy principles, encouraging recycling and using water wisely. We operate our buildings in accordance with our company-wide Environmental and Energy Management Systems, which are certi/fied to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 respectively.\n\nSustainable materials\n\nAs part of our transition to net zero, we're focusing on lean design, using innovative construction methods and low-carbon materials. We include carbon consultants in the design team from the very start, to guide decisions on the most carbone/fficient solution and we account for the embodied carbon implications of design options.\n\n100% of our core construction materials are from responsible sources and last year, we signed up to SteelZero, committing to purchasing 50% of our steel as low carbon by 2030, and 100% by 2050. This will in/fluence collective purchasing power across our industry as it sends a strong signal about demand, to shift global markets and policies towards responsible production and sourcing of steel.\n\nSteelZero steel must meet ResponsibleSteel standards or be produced by a steelmaking site where the owner has de/fined and made public both a long-term emissionsreduction pathway and a medium-term, quantitative-science-based GHG emissions target such as a science-based target approved by the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative).\n\nManaging our waste\n\nAcross our operations and developments, we are committed to achieving at least a 75% annual recycling rate. In 2021/22, we achieved a 71% recycling rate across our operations and a 99% recycling rate across our developments. We have increased recycling rate across our operations by 6pp since 2020/21.\n\nThis increase has been driven mainly by the increase in recyclable materials produced by our brand partners, in particular F&B (such as packing materials, cardboard and glass), as well as retail returning to normal operations and easing of Covid-19-related restrictions. We expect to see a continuation of progress towards 75% recycling throughout the coming year.\n\nAdditionally, to tackle tech poverty which was brought into sharp relief during the pandemic, we've donated over 265 reconditioned devices to charities across the UK. The devices have been used to support young people in accessing their education, and helping people out of work access support services and apply for jobs.\n\nUsing water wisely\n\nWith the change in climate, water stress is becoming an important risk to consider. We have already implemented a number of initiatives to improve water e/fficiency across our developments achieving more than 50% reduction in water consumption compared to a typical build on The Forge, SE1 and n2, SW1.\n\nWe recognise however that more needs to be done and we will be undertaking water-management assessments at assets under our operational control to identify opportunities to use water more e/fficiently.",

One that helps tackle the social inequalities speci/fic to our local areas, and addresses the current and future skills we need. We also know that our business does not yet re/flect the diverse communities we're part of, especially at senior levels.\n\nOur social programme therefore aims to empower people facing barriers with the skills and opportunities to enter the world of work and aims to tackle local socioeconomic issues in the areas we serve.\n\nWe do this through a suite of initiatives in all our local communities which are supported by volunteers from Landsec and our partners. We run employability workshops, focused on supporting prison leavers, people experiencing homelessness, and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, equipping them with the skills and con/fidence to enter work. We deliver educational interventions introducing young people to the range of careers available within real estate - seeking to increase the diversity of the sector. Where possible, bene/ficiaries of these programmes are o/ffered job opportunities in our business and supply chain.\n\nCreating opportunities for young people\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, we've supported the government's Kickstart scheme to provide opportunities for young people who have faced signi/ficant challenges due to Covid-19, and risked facing long-term unemployment. The scheme has brought talented individuals from our communities directly into Landsec, helping them realise their potential.\n\nThrough Kickstart, we have employed seven individuals who are working across a diverse range of business functions including sustainability, retail, customer, workspace and innovation. The group are developing their con/fidence and transferable skills, while bringing valuable new perspectives to our business.\n\nOne of our Kickstart colleagues said: 'Kickstart allows young people from di/fferent backgrounds to work in job sectors that they normally wouldn't think of applying to, thinking that it's not for them. Working at Landsec, I've been able to improve my con/fidence and self-esteem, gaining experience working on community projects.'",

This includes homelessness, a signi/ficant issue in many of our communities.\n\nThis year, we launched an initiative with our construction partner Sir Robert McAlpine at our 21 Moor/fields, EC2 development in The City of London, alongside homeless charity Crisis. The initiative was aimed at tackling job and housing insecurity for vulnerable candidates. It gave /five people who had experienced homelessness three weeks of employability training, work experience, accommodation support and ultimately a job interview on site.

This was the result of a competition where we invited young people from several of our Westminster schools, and community partners, to take part. We also showcased the artwork in the reception of 80 Victoria Street throughout November.\n\n## Inspiring the next generation of/uni00A0property professionals in/uni00A0Lewisham\n\nWe know our business, and our industry as a whole, does not yet re/flect the diverse communities we are part of, especially in senior roles.

Our education initiatives aim to address this, giving our industry's future leaders the insights, mentoring and pathways to pursue a career in real estate.\n\nIn Lewisham, we have been working with the Construction Youth Trust, our education partner that aims to increase young people's representation in the real estate sector. We developed a programme to engage young people at four local schools in an exciting careers project, supported by volunteers from our Lewisham project team.

We continue to support our strategy, for example by ensuring our ever-evolving retail propositions provide a safe, attractive o/ffering for our occupiers and visitors.\n\nAll our properties operate within a safetymanagement system certi/fied to ISO 45001, and we continue to conform to it. In January 2022 we achieved certi/fication to BS 9997 for our /fire risk management system, and produced clear requirements for our development projects in anticipation of the Building Safety Act. In March 2022 we were\n\nawarded an 'International Safety Award' at the 'distinction' level by the British Safety Council in recognition of our commitment to health and safety over the year.\n\nTo enable continuous safety and health progress, we reviewed occupational hazards in May 2021. Based on this, we identi/fied and prioritised seven key areas we could improve. The topics focused on reducing the risk of occupational safety hazards, hazards to our people, partners and our customers.\n\nWe have worked with other leading property companies to establish uniformity in our safety and health data as a way of enabling performance benchmarking against our peer group.\n\n## Responsible procurement\n\nWe focus on building strong, long-term relationships with our strategic suppliers - including those suppliers who employ people to work on our sites. All suppliers are asked to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct which sets out our minimum expectations on how we expect our suppliers to act in relation to fairness, wages, diversity, equality and inclusivity. Additionally, all strategic suppliers are expected to operate our sites with respect to Landsec's policies and standards on health and safety, anti-harassment and bullying, diversity and inclusion.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, we publish annually our Modern Slavery Statement that describes the policies, processes and actions we have undertaken to address and prevent modern slavery across our business and supply chain.\n\n## Business ethics\n\nTo achieve our purpose, we have to act ethically and with integrity, behaving in the right way and speaking up if we think others are not doing this.

The Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of risk and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system. The Executive Leadership Team is responsible for day-today monitoring and management of risks that impact the business. The Audit Committee supports the Board in the oversight of risk and is responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal control system during the year.\n\nWe have an established risk management and control framework that enables us to e/ffectively identify, evaluate and manage our principal and emerging risks. Our approach is not to eliminate risk, but to manage it within our appetite for each risk. We focus on being risk aware, clearly de/fining our risk appetite, responding to changes to our risk pro/file quickly and having a strong risk culture among employees.\n\nThe Risk Management function, headed by the Director of Risk and Assurance, facilitates risk discussions and provides challenge and insight where appropriate. The Risk Management function also oversees and provides support to various functions across the business.\n\n'Helping the business to navigate the challenges and opportunities it faces through proactive risk/uni00A0management.'\n\n## Identi/fication of risks\n\nIdentifying and quantifying risks is a continual process. We work with teams across the organisation, senior management, external agencies and stakeholders to identify the strategic, operational and legal and compliance risks facing our business. These are included on our Group Risk Register, which is challenged and validated by the Executive Leadership Team. Our principal risks, which are a sub-set of our Group risks, are reviewed by the Audit Committee before being presented to the Board. In addition, an in-depth risk session is held with the Board every year, with the next session taking place in December 2022.\n\n## Evaluation of risks\n\nWe use a risk scoring matrix to ensure risks are evaluated consistently. Our matrix considers likelihood, /financial impact to income and capital values and reputational impact. When we evaluate risk, we consider the inherent risk (before any mitigating action) and the residual risk (the risk that remains after mitigating actions and controls). From this, we identify principal risks (current risks with relatively high impact and certainty) and emerging risks (risks where the extent and implications are not yet fully understood). We have taken the opportunity this year to enhance our emerging risks process given the pace of business change.",

Scenario modelling has been used to better understand the impact of these risks on our business model when placed under varying degrees of stress, enabling interdependencies to be considered and plausible mitigation plans to be tested.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews our principal risk register at least twice per year as well as our Assurance Map, which sets out the key controls and assurance activities against each risk. This supports the Committee's evaluation of the control environment and the adequacy of assurance activity. The Committee also receives a summary report at each meeting describing key second and third line assurance activities, including internal audits, actions agreed and the status of open risk mitigation actions.\n\nDay-to-day ownership and management of key risks is assigned to members of the Executive Leadership Team. They are responsible for ensuring the e/ffectiveness of controls and for implementing risk mitigation plans, where necessary. The ELT reviews the Group Risk Register in detail at least twice per year and undertakes deep dives into speci/fic risks throughout the year to evaluate the current risk level, consider risk appetite and agree any further actions needed.\n\nKey operational principal risks, including health, safety and security, and information security and cyber threat are managed by dedicated second-line functions that de/fine and implement policy and mitigating controls, and undertake assurance activities.\n\nThe Group Insurance Team sits within the overall Risk and Assurance function, which enables collaboration between Insurance and Risk teams and detailed consideration of risk treatment planning, residual risk and transference to the insurance market, where appropriate.\n\nWe identify where the impact of controls is greatest i.e. where there is a relatively high inherent risk and relatively low residual risk, and this helps to focus the work of Internal Audit and other assurance providers.\n\nLandsec has an Internal Audit function, which reports to the Director of Risk and Assurance that provides independent assurance over key controls and processes to management and the Audit Committee.\n\n## See page 102 for more information in/uni00A0the/uni00A0Report of the Audit Committee\n\nIn addition, the Internal Audit team manages Landsec's Key Controls Toolkit. The Toolkit is a set of clearly de/fined controls that are self-certi/fied by control owners within the business to provide ongoing assurance and coverage of key risks areas. The results of this process are monitored by the Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Board is responsible for de/fining the level of risk that the Group is willing to take and ensuring it remains in line with our strategy. Landsec's risk appetite di/ffers for each risk and varies signi/ficantly between strategic and operational risks. The risk appetite re/flects Landsec's risk management philosophy, and in turn in/fluences culture and operating style. To embed risk appetite e/ffectively in the business requires management to establish limits and thresholds for the key risk indicators associated with each risk. Scenario planning assists in setting these thresholds. Our Group Risk Register outlines high level Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) which are monitored regularly against thresholds set for our key risks. These risks are aligned to the strategy refresh process and stress-tested as part of a scenario planning exercise.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

The strategic risks relate to the macro-economic environment; our key markets/uni00A0- o/ffice and retail; our capital allocation; development; climate change; and people and skills. The most signi/ficant risks impacting the Group are the strategic risks that relate to structural changes in our markets often driven by customer behaviour or the wider economy such as growth, rising in/flation, interest rates and the availability of capital. The operational risks are health, safety or security incident, and cyber attack.\n\nThere have been a number of changes to our principal risks since the half-year update, which have largely impacted our strategic risks and were most commonly driven by Covid-19 and its ongoing impact on behaviours and the wider economy.\n\nThe risk from the macroeconomic outlook is our most signi/ficant risk due to rising in/flation and the impact that it is expected to have on the economy, yields and interest rates; plus the war in Ukraine and resultant volatility in oil prices and supply chain impacts may increase the threat of an economic retrenchment. The net risk has remained stable as, so far, Landsec has been resilient against these headwinds.\n\nThe other big movement has been in the Retail and hospitality occupier market risk. This was Landsec's biggest risk due to falling retail asset values and the\n\nuncertainty created by Covid-19 and the acceleration of online retailing. However, over the past year, many of the factors that drove that increase have subsided leading to a downgrade of the risk, though the macroeconomic headwinds noted above continue to be carefully monitored.\n\nThe O/ffice occupier market risk is our biggest market-speci/fic strategic risk due to the size of our o/ffice portfolio. It has remained stable, due to strong market signals and the post-Covid-19 return to o/ffice.\n\nThe risk related to Capital allocation was considered in the context of our refreshed strategy and move into urban mixed-use neighbourhoods with associated residential units. The risk has remained largely stable but will be reviewed again as delivery of our strategy progresses.\n\nThe last signi/ficant change has been the inclusion of Development strategy risk amongst our principal risks. Given the planned increases in our development pipeline, especially following the acquisition of U+I and MediaCity, it was deemed appropriate to include this risk.\n\nOther changes in principal risks to note were:\n\n- \u2192 Climate change - Net risk reduced as the further planning and development of our fully costed plan to achieve net zero has reduced the transitional element of the risk. Physical elements have remained constant.\n\n- \u2192 People and skills - This risk largely relates to succession planning risk for senior management. Progress on delivering the strategy and the enterprise value created as a result have increased the potential impact of an unexpected departure of a key member of the leadership team. This risk has also increased to re/flect increasing attrition rates due to external market conditions and a buoyant recruitment market post pandemic.\n- \u2192 Major health, safety or security incident /uni00A0The likelihood of a major health, safety or security incident was brie/fly elevated during the year as a result of the acquisitions of U+I and MediaCity properties, which temporarily increased uncertainty over these recently acquired assets. We have since reduced the likelihood of the risk as we have now fully evaluated the assets and established riskprioritised integration plans.\n- \u2192 Information Security and Cyber threat /uni00A0The risk of information security and cyber incidents has increased due to the prevalence of ransomware attacks, though the net risk is unchanged as Landsec's defences have sought to match and o/ffset this increase. Following the acquisition of U+I, steps are being taken to migrate U+I sta/ff and data/ systems to the Landsec IT environment.\n\nThe principal risk heatmap is shown below which shows the relative position of each risk before mitigating controls (gross) and after controls (net).",

As climate change is considered a principal risk, the Board considers the impact of climate risks when discussing Landsec strategy and long-term success, including signi/ficant investment decisions.\n\nThe Audit Committee supports the Board in the management of risk and is responsible for reviewing our principal risk register at least twice a year, the e/ffectiveness of our risk management and internal control processes. This year, the Committee focused on increasing their understanding of the TCFD recommendations with a teach-in session delivered by an external advisor and the sustainability team, which supported the Committee in their review of the TCFD disclosures.\n\nOngoing ownership and management of climate-related risks is carried out by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), chaired by our CEO and supported by our CFO, COO and Managing Directors. ELT is responsible for developing the sustainability strategy to ensure it addresses our relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities including those pertaining to climate change. Sustainability and climate risks are discussed quarterly or more often if required.\n\nThe ELT is supported by the Sustainability Forum, a senior management group responsible for delivering programmes of work to meet our sustainability targets and to mitigate climate risks. The Sustainability Team, led by the Head of ESG and Sustainability, is responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of the sustainability strategy and updating the climate risks, collaborating with all areas of the business to ensure appropriate mitigation and adaptation plans are in place.\n\nOur commitment to address climate change risks is embedded across the business with climate-related targets linked to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIP) and employees' remuneration, including our science-based carbon reduction target, energy e/fficiency and embodied carbon from new developments.\n\nA diagram showing the governance structure and reporting lines to manage climate-risk is provided within Our approach to sustainability section on page 48.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## Identifying risks and opportunities\n\nAs a UK real estate company, our business is exposed to both physical and transition risks and opportunities from climate change. Physical risks relate to the physical impacts of climate change such as /flooding events, windstorms, increase in temperature and sea level rise. Transition risks relate to the transition to a lowercarbon economy to avoid the worst physical impacts of climate change, such as existing and emerging regulatory changes.\n\nIn accordance with the TCFD recommendations, we've assessed these risks against two science-based scenarios (below 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C scenarios) and considered them over two time frames: short-to-medium term (now until 2030) and long term (2030-2100).\n\nThese timescales have been chosen as from now until 2030, we are taking actions to meet our science-based carbon reduction target mitigating against transitional risks and with the designed lifespan of our assets being over 60, identifying long-term risks until 2100 are important for our investment and development decisions to ensure our portfolio remains resilient in the long term.\n\n## Below 2\u00b0C scenario\n\nThis scenario is aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) RCP 2.6 and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-1.9, in which there is a high likelihood that global temperatures will not exceed more than 2\u00b0C over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century. The scenario assumes proactive and sustained action to reduce carbon emissions over the next 30 years to build a low carbon economy. For this scenario to be possible, global e/fforts to mitigate climate change will need to intensify immediately, led and supported by strong policy, regulatory and legal",

Furthermore, rapid investment in low-carbon technology will need to occur, with widespread adoption of sustainable consumption, business practices and lifestyles.\n\nIn this scenario, predicted changes in the UK climate are marginally higher year-round temperatures and lower precipitation in summer. The risk to our business under this scenario from /flooding and windstorm remains within the current and natural variability.\n\n## 4\u00b0C scenario\n\nThis scenario is aligned with the IPCC's RCP 8.5 and SSP 5-8.5, where climate change will increase by up to 4\u00b0C by 2100. The scenario assumes that competitive markets, innovation and participatory societies act to produce rapid growth\n\n## Short term (until 2030)\n\n## Long term (2030-2100)\n\n## High transition risks associated with aggressive mitigation actions to reduce emissions\n\n- \u2192Enhanced existing and emerging regulations, for example Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standards (MEES) raised requirements for all nondomestic rented properties to meet a minimum EPC B, potentially impacting nearly 64% of our portfolio value\n- \u2192Increased pricing of carbon emissions expected to reach \u00a387/tCO 2 ($100/tCO2), impacting operational costs\n- \u2192Change in customer expectations regarding o/ffices, as more companies committed to becoming net zero and set science-based targets\n\nNo signi/ficant changes to current physical risks (as described below).\n\n## Business as usual with no signi/ficant change in transition and physical risks\n\nNo signi/ficant changes to current physical risks.\n\n- \u21922.1% of portfolio located in areas highly exposed to river /flood with a return period of 100 years\n- \u21924.6% of portfolio located in areas highly exposed to storm surge (coastal /flooding) with a return period of 100 years\n\n## < 2 \u00ba C sce n a r io\n\n## 4 \u00ba C sce n a r io\n\nIn line with our risk management and control framework, we use a risk scoring matrix to ensure risks are evaluated consistently and actions are prioritised accordingly. Our matrix considers likelihood, /financial impact to income and capital values and reputational impact. When we evaluate risk, we consider the inherent risk (before any mitigating action) and the residual risk (the risk that remains after mitigating actions and controls). From this, we identify principal risks (current risks with relatively high impact and certainty) and emerging risks (risks where the extent and implications are not yet fully understood).\n\n## Slight increase in physical risks\n\n- \u21923 to 20% increase in river peak /flows with no additional assets exposed compared with current risks\n- \u2192No signi/ficant change to exposure of portfolio to windstorm and impact is likely to remain within current natural weather variability\n- \u2192Warmer summers with +1.7\u00b0C maximum temperatures but no signi/ficant risk of heat stress\n\nTransition risks remain high as further mitigation actions and legislative changes are expected to continue driving reductions in carbon emissions.\n\n## Failure to transition leading to signi/ficant increase in physical risks and adaptation risks\n\n- \u2192Signi/ficantly hotter summers with +4\u00b0C to +7.6\u00b0C maximum temperatures\n- \u2192Sea level rise between 21-80cm on average which would put additional strain on the Thames Barrier\n- \u219221 to 56% increase in river peak /flows and potential /flood defence failures across the UK, leading to higher portfolio exposure\n\nAs consequence of the changes in climate and associated physical risks, signi/ficant increase in risks linked with adaptation measures are expected.\n\nBased on risks identi/fied in our scenario analysis, climate change is considered a principal risk in our risk register and the following climate-related risks have been prioritised, due to the signi/ficant impact to our business strategy in the short-medium timeframe: enhanced MEES regulation with minimum EPC B by 2030 and change in customer preferences, requiring reduction in carbon emissions and energy consumption across our portfolio.\n\nMore details about our risk identi/fication and assessment processes are provided within the Managing risk section on pages 58-59\n\nOur analysis showed us that our current portfolio is not highly exposed to physical risks given the location of our assets and/uni00A0the impact of physical risks to our portfolio will only become more relevant in/uni00A0the long term, under a four-degree scenario. Conversely, transition risks are relevant in the short term as increasing mitigating actions to drive emissions reduction are expected, such as policy and/uni00A0regulation changes, as well as change/uni00A0in customer preference.\n\nat whatever costs. There is an increasing adoption of resource and energy intensive lifestyles around the world and the push for economic and social development is coupled with the exploitation of abundant fossil fuels.\n\nIn the 4\u00b0C scenario, in the lead-up to 2030, limited actions are taken to mitigate climate change, current levels of investment in low-carbon technology continue, and emissions continue to rise along their current trajectory. In the period between 2030 and 2100, the physical e/ffects of climate change begin to intensify rapidly, and government, business and society will need to adapt to the e/ffects.\n\nIn this scenario it is likely we will experience an increase in /flash /flooding, river /floods, coastal /flooding and storm surges.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreases in year-round temperature are predicted, with summer temperatures at 5.4\u00b0C higher and winter temperatures at 4.2\u00b0C higher than the current climate. Higher levels of precipitation are predicted in winter at up to +35%, and lower levels of summer precipitation are predicted at down to -47%.\n\nWe've assessed physical and transitional risks for our business against these scenarios and the output of our scenario analysis is summarised below. As we continue to evolve our approach to identify and assess climate risks, this year we have used MSCI's Climate Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to assess our portfolio exposure to physical climate risks. Physical risks are assessed based on the geolocation of assets and their exposure to individual hazards as a consequence of climate change.",

We conduct thorough due diligence understanding the asset's performance metrics, including: energy consumption, energy performance certi/ficates and other sustainability certi/fications, /flood risk assessment and embodied carbon assessment.\n\n## Development\n\nWe are committed to design and build net zero buildings. For each development, we aim to reduce emissions associated with construction by focusing on prioritising retention and material reuse; adopting smart design; employing modern methods of construction and standardising core construction elements to reduce waste. We're also driving change in our supply chain, balancing upfront carbon with whole life carbon to ensure that our design decisions do not negatively impact the longer term carbon impacts of our assets.\n\nAdditionally, our developments are typically designed to last over 60 years, and therefore we're designing buildings to be more resilient and able to cope with our changing climate. We manage the impact of physical risks such as higher cooling costs and lower heating demand by adapting\n\nbuilding services design, reducing heating capacity and maintaining summer cooling capacity to cope with heatwaves. The performance of our facades and fabric materials is designed to address the expected higher temperatures to minimise energy demand, as well as to be able to withstand extreme temperatures and increased wind speeds to avoid maintenance issues or damage to buildings in future. Our drainage strategies are designed to mitigate foreseen rain levels and /flood risks using physical and naturebased solutions.\n\n## Operations\n\nWe operate our buildings in accordance with our company-wide Environmental and Energy Management Systems, which are certi/fied to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 respectively, having Energy Reduction Plans (ERPs) and action plans for all our assets, which outline how we will reduce the energy use and carbon emissions of the asset e/ffectively. Through these plans, we will continue to plan and deliver improved controls and e/fficient energy systems. The ERPs form part of the operational /financial planning for each asset.\n\nFor all assets located in areas highly exposed to physical risks, we have developed plans to ensure that adequate protection and mitigation plans are in place, including Business Continuity and Emergency Response Plans.\n\nTo meet our science-based target and stay ahead of impending 2030 Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standards (MEES) requirements of minimum EPC B, we've developed a \u00a3135m net zero transition investment plan that will be used to fund the following initiatives:\n\n- \u2192 Optimising building management systems across our portfolio, deploying innovative technologies such as arti/ficial intelligence to reduce operational energy consumption;\n\n- \u2192 Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels replacing gas-/fired boilers with electric systems such as Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHP);\n- \u2192 Increasing on-site renewable electricity generation by installing solar PVs across our retail assets; and\n- \u2192 Engaging and collaborating with our customers on energy e/fficiency to drive down consumption within their spaces.\n\n## Further details on our transition to net zero are provided on pages 49-52\n\nAs we continue to build relationships with our suppliers, we ask suppliers to provide climate-related information such as carbon emissions, energy consumption and relevant climate-related targets. This information helps us to better understand suppliers operations and prioritise future engagement activities.\n\n## Impact on /financial planning\n\nWe have considered how these climaterelated risks and opportunities may impact on our /financial statements. For the current year the main impact is the recognition of impending ESG investment relating to our \u00a3135m net zero transition investment fund. We have factored key actions such as the installation of air source heat pumps and refurbishment costs to increase EPC ratings into the asset valuations of relevant assets.\n\n## Resilience of our strategy and business/uni00A0model\n\nOur analysis gives us con/fidence in the resilience of our strategy, as we're supporting the transition to a low-carbon world whilst managing the impact of climate-related risks to our portfolio. We recognise our strategy and adaptation measures may need to evolve in the long term, particularly under a 4\u00b0C scenario.",

This will likely include divestment of assets which are less resilient to extreme heat and rainfall, or investment into infrastructure to limit the impact of /flooding and coastal surge. This scenario could also result in changes to our customers' and supply chain partners' businesses, including business failures or supply chain disruption. Increased due diligence in supply chain selection will be required, particularly considering the sourcing of construction materials which may be processed or manufactured in countries where the e/ffects of climate change are more extreme.\n\n## Risk management\n\nClimate change is identi/fied as a principal risk and therefore is governed and managed in line with our risk management and control framework. This framework enables us to e/ffectively identify, assess and manage climate-related risks - evaluating the potential impact, the consequences, allocation of risk owner, description of controls and control owners, and /finally an evaluation of any residual risks.\n\nAs part of its overall responsibility for risk, the Board undertakes a bi-annual assessment, taking account of those risks that would threaten our business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity as well as the Group's strategic objectives. Scenario modelling, including the climate scenario analysis detailed on pages 66-67, is used to better understand the impact of these risks on our business model when placed under varying degrees of stress, enabling interdependencies to be considered and plausible mitigation plans to be tested.\n\nOwnership and management of all risks is assigned to members of the Executive Leadership Team, who are responsible for ensuring the operating e/ffectiveness of the internal control systems and for implementing key risk mitigation plans.\n\nThe senior leader responsible for climaterelated risk is the Head of ESG and Sustainability, who ensures appropriate mitigation actions are taken.

This con/firmation is made after having reviewed assumptions about future trading performance, valuation projections, capital expenditure, asset sales and debt requirements contained within the period ending 30 September 2023 from the Group's budget. The Directors also considered potential risks and uncertainties in the business, credit, market and liquidity risks, including the availability and repayment pro/file of bank facilities, as well as forecast covenant compliance. Further stress testing has been carried out to ensure the Group has su/fficient cash resources to continue in operation for at least the next 12 months over the year ended 31 March 2022 with materially reduced levels of cash receipts over the next 12 months. Based on the above, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Viability statement\n\n## The viability assessment period\n\nThe Directors have assessed the viability of the Group over a /five-year period to March 2027, taking account of the Group's current /financial position and the potential impact of our principal risks. The Directors have determined /five years to be the most appropriate period for the viability assessment as this is consistent with the Group's /five year strategic planning horizon.\n\n## Process\n\nOur /financial planning process comprises a budget for two /financial years and a strategic plan for /five /financial years. Generally, the budget has a greater level of certainty and is used to set near-term targets across the Group. The /five-year strategic plan is less certain than the budget, but provides a longer-term outlook against which strategic decisions can be made.\n\nThe /financial planning process considers the Group's pro/fitability, capital values, gearing, cash /flows and other key /financial metrics over the plan period. These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, in which a number of the main underlying assumptions are /flexed and tested to consider alternative macroeconomic environments. Additionally, the Group also considers the impact of potential structural changes to the business in light of varying economic conditions, such as signi/ficant additional sales and acquisitions or re/financing. These assumptions are then adapted further to assess the impact of\n\nconsiderably worse macroeconomic conditions than are currently expected, which forms the basis of the Group's 'Viability scenario'.\n\nGiven the recent unfavourable macroeconomic conditions in which the Group has been operating, additional stresstesting has been carried out on the Group's ability to continue in operation under extremely unfavourable operating conditions. While the assumptions we have applied in these scenarios are possible, they do not represent our view of the likely outturn. The Directors have also considered reverse stress-test scenarios including one in which we are unable to collect any rent for an extended period of time. The results of these tests help to inform the Directors' assessment of the viability of the Group.",

It aims to set a common language and clear de/finition to help companies, investors and policymakers understand whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable.\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a classi/fication system, establishing a list of sustainable economic activities that substantially contribute to the EU's six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nTo date, details for only the /first two environmental objectives were released: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAs a UK company, Landsec is not in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. However, we recognise the importance of providing our investors and stakeholders with information about the sustainability of our activities and portfolio of assets. For that reason, we have started working towards voluntarily disclosing information that can help investors to assess the alignment of our activities with the EU taxonomy.\n\nIn addition, the UK has already established a Green Technical Advisory Group to develop a UK Green Taxonomy, which will build on the EU taxonomy and will focus on net zero in the UK context. Taking steps to understand the requirements from the EU taxonomy, it helps us to prepare Landsec for the incoming implementation of the UK Green Taxonomy.\n\nIn the Build well section on pages 49-52, we provide information on how we are investing across our portfolio to transition to net zero, its current EPC ratings, and approach to new developments. We provide further information on our portfolio EPC ratings and building certi/fications in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\nThis Strategic Report was approved by the/uni00A0Board of Directors on 16 May 2022 and/uni00A0signed on its behalf by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Allan Chief Executive",

The Board is supportive of management's drive for more empowerment and accountability in our decision-making through the business.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe pandemic has created challenges for our employees, and the Board is very conscious that this has impacted our progress on cultural change. As a Board, we are therefore keen to increase our direct engagement with employees and seek opportunities where we can hear employees' views. This helps the Board to monitor and assess culture e/ffectively.\n\nWe introduced our Non-executive Director/ employee breakfasts this year which allow a small number of employees from across the business to meet with two Non-executive Directors on each occasion. Feedback from our Non-executive Directors and our employees has been very positive, with colleagues feeling that their views are being listened to. It also gives attendees an opportunity to hear about the Non-executive Directors' own perceptions and experiences.\n\nYou can read more about workforce engagement on page 90\n\n## Our purpose and our stakeholders\n\nOur purpose - sustainable places, connecting communities, realising potential - puts all our stakeholders at the forefront of the Board's decision-making. This has been a key part of the major decisions that the Board has made during the year, including the acquisition of U+I and our 75% stake in MediaCity.\n\nIn February, the Board bene/fited from meeting with representatives from Manchester City Council to discuss May/field's role in the city's growth agenda, and also spent time with the U+I management team understanding the context and vision for the May/field site. The Board also met with Salford City Council and our joint venture partner The Peel Group at MediaCity, which\n\nCressida Hogg Chairman\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nI am pleased to introduce the/uni00A0governance section of this year's Annual Report.\n\nThis section of the report gives more detail on the governance structures that we have in place, and how we comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\nThe Board takes seriously its responsibility for the long-term sustainable success of the Company, generating value for our shareholders and contributing more widely to society.\n\nAs I outlined in my Chairman's statement on page 4, this has been a year of delivering our new strategy as we emerge from the challenges of the pandemic. Covid-19 has impacted all aspects of our business and all our stakeholders. E/ffective governance together with the strength of leadership of our Board provides structure and stability in times of uncertainty.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nStrategy and culture need to be aligned for us to achieve our purpose, and governance has a key role to play in the culture that we want to create. We want to be a datadriven, customer-centric business which is able to respond quickly to the changing needs of our customers and stakeholders. However, we also need to ensure that our governance structures create su/fficient\n\ngave the Board a greater understanding of the mixed-use nature of MediaCity, the range of customers and an insight into plans for the second phase of development.\n\nFor further information on the Board and our stakeholders, see pages 87-91\n\n## Board and committee changes\n\nThere have been a number of changes to the Board and its Committees this year. Vanessa Simms joined Landsec on 4 May 2021, and became CFO on 1 June 2021, succeeding Martin Greenslade. Stacey Rauch stepped down on 24 June 2021, having served over nine years on the Board and as a result of Stacey's departure, we made some changes to our committee composition which you can read about in our Nomination Committee report on pages 94-99. The chairs of the Audit and Remuneration committees report on their activities through the year later in this report, and I would like to thank them for their hard work during the year on behalf of the Board.\n\n## External Board evaluation\n\nThis year our Board evaluation was carried out externally by the advisory /firm No 4. The evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees are working well, and all the Board members feel con/fident that the Board is working in a collaborative and open way. Areas of focus for the year ahead will be Board and management succession planning, continued execution of our strategy, cultural change and continued focus on Landsec becoming a data-driven business. Next year's evaluation will be conducted internally.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking members of the Board for their continued support and commitment over the past year. We have all appreciated being able to hold Board meetings in person once again, and have enjoyed the bene/fits of more informal engagement in face-to-face meetings both at Board level and with our employees.\n\nI hope that you /find this section of the report informative and useful.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCressida Hogg Chairman",

This year, the Board held two additional Board meetings to discuss the acquisition of U and I Group PLC (trading as U+I).\n\nAll members of the Board attended all Board and Committee meetings during their tenure and membership, with the exception of the Chairman who missed one Board meeting due to family bereavement.\n\nIf the Board needs to make decisions in between meetings, it can do so by unanimous approval by email but will only do so in such situations where the matter has been discussed at previous meetings so that Directors are fully appraised, have had the opportunity to ask questions and are therefore in a position to make a fully informed decision.\n\nThis year due to the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions we have been able to once again hold the majority of Board meetings in person. The Board has enjoyed the bene/fits of the more informal engagement that face-to-face meetings provide both at Board level and with Landsec employees.\n\nThe Board met for three Each had a focus for discussion:\n\ndinners/uni00A0throughout the year. changes to the /finance function; U+I integration; and talent strategy. In addition, these occasions provided the Board with an opportunity for/uni00A0informal, free /flow conversation, away from the time restrictions of Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmeetings. The Non-executive Directors also met without the Executive Directors being present at the end of every meeting.\n\n## Execution of strategy\n\nThis year, much of the focus of the Board has been on execution of strategy, the development of Landsec's equity story and how all of Landsec's stakeholder interests are being taken into account during a year of signi/ficant internal and external change.\n\nAhead of Landsec's two acquisitions in Manchester, the Board carried out a deep dive into the Manchester market to ensure that it fully understood the macro, o/ffice and residential market and environment ahead of making any decision on investment. Several members of the Board visited Manchester over the summer to experience /firsthand what the city has to o/ffer and in particular to visit MediaCity, Europe's largest purpose built creative, tech and media hub.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board continued to reinforce the importance of culture as an important aspect to strategic success. You can read more about the Board and our culture on pages 92 and 93.\n\n## Sustainability deep dive for the Board\n\nIn July the Board received a session from our sustainability team on net zero and what this means for Landsec. The purpose of the session was to/uni00A0bring the Board's level of understanding up to speed on: understanding terminology; the net zero landscape and what moving to a net zero economy means for Landsec; and Landsec's commitments.\n\nThe sustainability team returned to the Board later in the year to present its refreshed sustainability framework to the Board.",

The Board was keen to hear from Manchester City Council what it thought were the biggest challenges and opportunities for the city and in particular the May/field development. It was insightful for the Board to hear /firsthand the history of the May/field site and how elements of its heritage were preserved in the design.\n\nThe Board enjoyed a tour around the site and welcomed the opportunity to ask questions to the U+I management team. The Board was impressed by the scale of the site and could envisage how the park will provide such an important community space in the centre of the city.\n\nThe Board then went on to MediaCity where it received a presentation from Salford City Council and also its joint venture partner The Peel Group.\n\nThe Board heard from The Peel Group about the environmental and social targets at MediaCity based on The Peel Group's ESG strategy and social value framework.\n\nThe Board had a tour of MediaCity, including the Studios, which gave the Board a sense of the mixed-use nature of the site, the range of customers and an insight into the plans for the second phase of development which will be split into commercial and residential use.\n\nRead more on landsec.com",

This requires that Directors promote the success of the Company for the bene/fit of the members, having regard to the interest of stakeholders in their decision-making. Over the next few pages, we provide examples of how the Board engages with stakeholders and takes into account their interests when making decisions.\n\nAn introduction to our stakeholders can be found in our Strategic Report on page 13\n\n## Stakeholders and Board decision-making\n\nOur stakeholders' interests and priorities continue to change as we adapt to the impact the pandemic has had on our lives, the way we work, shop and engage with each other. Therefore, e/ffective communication with our stakeholders so that we continue to keep pace with their evolving needs continues to be important for our long-term success. The Board's engagement with stakeholders is both direct and by management reporting up to the Board on stakeholder engagement, the importance of which is embedded throughout our business.\n\n## Data and our stakeholders\n\nThe Board has monitored closely during the year how the business is increasingly using data as a catalyst for business transformation and how it will manage data as a strategic asset going forward. Manjiry Tamhane's data analytics background has kept data at the heart of the Board's decision-making, ensuring that data is enabling the business to act with pace, responding to our people, partners' and customers' ever-changing needs and using data to predict how those needs may change in the future. The way we use data e/ffectively is a crucial part of our stakeholder relationships and ensuring that stakeholders' interests are addressed in our decision-making.",

This has helped to understand the changing requirements of o/ffice customers as a result of the pandemic in terms of less space or requiring space to be used in a di/fferent way and the increased demand for 'healthy buildings'. As a business we have listened to o/ffice occupiers regarding their needs, resulting in us providing greater /flexibility of o/ffice leases.\n\nThe Managing Director for Retail presented to the Board the role that physical retail might have to play in the future, which provided the Board with a deep dive on our retail strategy. The Reimagine Retail change programme is based on three main strategies: the future asset, brand partners and guest experience, and the Board will continue to monitor progress going forward.\n\nThe Board was briefed on the impact of the rent moratorium and Landsec's engagement with the Government proposal. There was further pressure on occupiers to pay rent due to lockdown restrictions during the year and we continued to work with occupiers most in need of support during trading restrictions.\n\n## Our communities\n\nThe Board's focus on execution of the mixed-use urban opportunities strategy discussed the importance that these developments play in the community and the connection between our purpose and our strategy.\n\nThe Board heard directly from Manchester City Council on the importance of the May/field development to the community and the environment with the provision of community parkland in the middle of the city. Community and sustainability are at the heart of the May/field development.\n\nThe Board was kept up to date on community support which continued to be challenged through further lockdowns and social distancing measures. Community employment and education programmes have continued remotely.\n\nSite teams at our assets provided practical assistance during the pandemic, for example, linking our food retailers in London to local homeless charities we work with for food donations.\n\nYou can read more about our community support on pages 53-55\n\n## Our partners\n\nBoard agenda time was spent on understanding Manchester as a market in advance of the proposed acquisitions. The Board met with representatives from Salford and Manchester City Councils to ensure we understand their priorities and challenges and what support Landsec can provide.\n\nThe Board met with representatives from The Peel Group, our new joint venture partner at MediaCity, and also encouraged increased communication and alignment with existing joint venture partners.\n\nA particular focus of the Board during the year was Landsec's response to Government and residents on /fire safety at our residential assets as the new legislation impacting our assets has been brought into force.\n\nThe Board was updated by our Managing Director of Corporate A/ffairs at several Board meetings throughout the year on local and national Government issues impacting our business. The Board also discussed the output of Landsec's local and national Government engagement.\n\nThe Board was kept updated about communication with service providers as restrictions were imposed and lifted on our assets to ensure smooth and safe transition.\n\n\u2192\n\nKEY BOARD DECISIONS MADE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR\n\n## BLUEWATER\n\nIn December 2021, the Board approved the acquisition of an additional 25% share in Bluewater from Lendlease Retail Partnership for \u00a3168m. In a separate deal, Landsec agreed to sell 25% of this additional 25% share to co-owner M&G for its pro rata share of the purchase price with the deal completing in March 2022. As a result of this separate deal, Landsec's ownership of Bluewater is now 48.75%.\n\nBluewater is one of the UK's largest out-of-town shopping centres and the largest of its kind in the South East of England. The Board considered that this acquisition was an opportunity at a time when retail values and rents are starting to stabilise. Together with the other co-owners, we have a clear vision for Bluewater which builds on what is already a thriving retail destination. This investment underlines our strategic commitment to major retail destinations that o/ffer something that can't easily be replicated online.\n\nIn order to make the decision to proceed with this additional investment in Bluewater, the Board discussed at length the future of retail, what opportunities lay ahead for Landsec, together with the risks.",

Opportunities to participate in large scale, established mixed-use developments are scarce and MediaCity was one such opportunity. The acquisition presented Landsec with the opportunity to deploy capital immediately into high-quality income producing assets and also to invest further over time through the development of a second phase of development.\n\nThe Board also considered that the acquisition would be a positive opportunity to work alongside The Peel Group as our joint venture partner, whose experience and expertise complements our own. The Peel Group's extensive experience in the North West, combined with Landsec's development capabilities,\n\nwill provide the opportunity to deliver the long-term vision for MediaCity by delivering culture and inclusivity through industry-leading placemaking activity, building a sustainable community and designing and delivering workspace for the future creative and technology workforce.\n\nGreater Manchester is well placed to support Landsec's strategy. It is currently the UK's largest regional economy, the largest regional o/ffice market in terms of stock, take up and transactional liquidity and is at the forefront of the emerging institutional build-to-rent market.\n\nIn September 2021, the Board approved the acquisition of 75% of MediaCity for\n\n## \u00a3425.6m\n\n## U+I GROUP ACQUISITION\n\nIn December 2021 we completed the public takeover of U and I Group PLC (trading as U+I) for \u00a3269m. U+I owns two key sites of interest to Landsec, May/field in Manchester and the Liberty of Southwark and, in addition, brings a proven front-end placemaking capability. Two additional Board meetings were held to discuss the acquisition, and in particular the contents of the o/ffer document. Sign-o/ff for the /final documentation was delegated to a Sub-Committee of the Board composed of the Chairman and the three Executive Directors.\n\nThe U+I team has a proven track record of building strong relationships with local authorities and securing attractive planning consents based on strong visioning and placemaking skills. The Board determined this to be an attractive addition to Landsec's existing development capabilities and the U+I approach could be applied to existing Landsec projects as well as future opportunities.\n\nThe Board further concluded that there was an alignment of cultures between Landsec and U+I with a shared focus on developing sustainable communities in the interests of our broader stakeholders.\n\nThe acquisition was in line with Landsec's strategy to recycle investment in order to drive growth and generate higher returns, including through urban opportunities in London and other major regional cities.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the blurring of lines between where people live, work and socialise. In response to this, mixed-use developments with a clear sense of place are becoming a more important part of the fabric of cities. The Board believes that Landsec is well positioned with its existing development and asset management capabilities and balance sheet strength to create these places and achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe Board continues to discuss the integration of U+I into the Landsec business as well as monitoring progress on these key sites.",

Our Chairman, Cressida Hogg, met with the Employee Forum in July, October and November 2021. Many topics were raised including cultural change, employee engagement, talent and development and communication.\n\nMark Allan, our CEO, also meets regularly with the Employee Forum to answer any questions and get an indication of topical issues of importance to employees.\n\nTwo employee breakfasts with the Nonexecutive Directors took place during the year which gave the opportunity for a small group of employees from across the business to meet with two Non-executive Directors on each occasion. The Nonexecutive Directors who have attended the breakfasts have reported that it was a great opportunity to get an insight into culture and receive feedback directly from employees.\n\nManjiry Tamhane and Colette O'Shea held a Q&A event for Landsec's Women's Network at which Manjiry shared her challenges and achievements and tips for success and responded openly to questions from employees about all aspects of her career.

Therefore the Board has discussed the impact that all these aspects are having on culture and the morale and sentiment amongst the workforce at every Board meeting throughout the year.\n\nThe Board has greatly bene/fited from receiving a /first-hand insight into culture through the introduction of the Nonexecutive Director/employee breakfasts which have proved to be a great success. These occasions allow our Non-executive Directors to hear directly from employees about what they feel is going well, anything that could be improved or done di/fferently and gives the Board a direct sense of culture.\n\n## Read more on our workforce engagement on page 90\n\nThe Board has challenged management about whether it is doing enough to shift the culture at Landsec and whether blockers to cultural change are being adequately identi/fied and addressed. The Board has particularly focused on speci/fic culture drivers including promotion of talent and development within the business, and diversity and inclusion.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board has requested a number of changes to give it greater oversight of the progress being made. For example, talent management and development was moved from a Nomination Committee agenda item to the main Board and similarly, diversity and inclusion was moved from a Remuneration Committee discussion to the main Board. The Board has also requested that the method of employee engagement survey is revisited so that Landsec can be benchmarked externally against other employers to provide more meaningful data.\n\nSet out on this page are four cultural themes that we feel are critical to operating our business model and executing our strategy. Each theme has a set of metrics and our assessment of our progress. These metrics are provided to the Board as additional context for its discussions on culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Purpose and meaning\n\nWe give our employees a sense of purpose as to why Landsec exists with a focus on our role\n\nin wider society. Our purpose - sustainable places, connecting communities, realising potential - re/flects our role in wider society and consideration of all our stakeholders continues to be more important than ever and has been at the forefront of Board discussions and central to our culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethics and fairness\n\nWe behave ethically and treat all our stakeholders fairly. Our employees are critical to\n\nour business and we continue to nurture talent and development and to assess our gender pay gap to build a balanced, diverse workforce for the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transparency and openness\n\nWe share information openly and discuss our challenges and\n\nmistakes. The importance of e/ffective communication and transparency is crucial to our culture. We continue to hold town halls and have introduced Nonexecutive Director/employee breakfasts to o/ffer a means of direct, informal engagement between our Board and our workforce. We have encouraged our workforce to reassess priorities and to feel empowered to challenge expectations placed upon them in terms of what and how we deliver.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collaboration and/uni00A0growth\n\nWe collaborate, innovate and collectively contribute to\n\nLandsec's growth.

The composition of the Board underpins the quality of debate and challenge during discussions.\n\nThe process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for its approval. It is the Nomination Committee's responsibility to keep Board composition under review, including reviewing director independence and tenure. During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and skills of the Board, and developed an ongoing plan for Board succession, taking into account recent and likely future Board changes.\n\nThe Committee is currently leading a search for one more Non-executive Director to join the Board to complement the Board's existing composition. The Committee is using an external search /firm to help with this, and we will report on the outcome of this process in due course.\n\nThe Committee has responsibility for oversight of Executive Leadership Team and senior management succession. This is also discussed by the Board as a whole, with a focus on diversity and inclusion and developing and maintaining the internal talent pipeline.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board believes that diversity at Board level sets the tone for diversity throughout the business.

The Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse pool of talent being developed at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess and promote this.\n\nWhilst the new Listing Rule requirements on diversity do not come into force until FY 22/23, I am pleased to report that we already meet these targets. 56% of our Board members are women, our Chair and CFO positions are held by women, and we have one member of the Board from an ethnic minority background. We acknowledge that more work is needed to increase diversity of our Executive Leadership Team and its direct reports whilst ensuring that appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria and the Committee, and the Board will continue to monitor progress.\n\nYou can read more about diversity at Landsec in our People and Culture section on/uni00A0 pages 38-43\n\n## Committee e/ffectiveness\n\nThe Committee's e/ffectiveness was assessed as part of the external Board review. The review highlighted that whilst the Committee operates e/ffectively, its focus over the past two years has particularly been on Executive succession. With a new leadership team in place it is appropriate to reset the Committee's priorities to focus more on wider Board succession, while continuing to cover all areas of the Committee's remit including ongoing management succession planning.\n\nFurther details on the external Board evaluation can be found on pages 96-98\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Committee oversees the corporate governance agenda on behalf of the Board. I am pleased to con/firm that Landsec has complied with and applied all of the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code for the /financial year ended 31 March 2022.

We set out the appointment process for our CFO in last year's report.\n\n## Non-executive Director changes\n\nStacey Rauch stepped down on 24 June 2021, having served over nine years on the Board. Stacey remained on the Board post reaching her nine-year anniversary of appointment (January 2021) in order to help transition Manjiry Tamhane onto the Board.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board's policy on diversity establishes the importance of diversity in the broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also experience, skills, professional background, tenure and also other di/fferentials between directors such as cognitive and personal strengths. The Board believes that diversity is crucial to creating a high-performing, e/ffective Board, to provide a breadth of perspective and debate that aids decisionmaking and which supports and directs the business more e/ffectively.\n\nThe Nomination Committee works with executive search consultants to ensure they support our approach to diversity in providing a diverse selection of candidates for Board appointments and the selection can then be based upon merit and objective criteria.\n\nDiversity at Board level sets the tone for diversity throughout the business. The Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse succession pool of talent being developed and maintained at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess this.\n\nDiversity is also addressed at the Remuneration Committee, particularly in the context of gender pay gap, and discussed at the main Board in light of its increased focus on the promotion and maintenance of diversity at all levels of talent throughout our business.\n\nFurther information on diversity at Landsec can be found on page 40\n\n## Independence and re-election to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board\n\nThe independence, e/ffectiveness and commitment of each of the Non-executive Directors has been reviewed by the Committee. The Committee is satis/fied with the contributions and time commitment of all the Non-executive Directors during the year.\n\nThe Committee will always discuss the additional commitments of all Directors (including the Chairman) before recommending their approval to the Board. It considers potential con/flict issues as part of that assessment. The Committee is con/fident that each of the Non-executive Directors remains independent and will be in a position to discharge their duties and responsibilities in the coming year. From a governance perspective, the Board as a whole is independent.\n\nThe appointments of Vanessa Simms and Manjiry Tamhane were rati/fied by shareholders at the AGM in July 2021.\n\nAll the Directors will stand for re-election at the AGM in July 2022 with the support of the Board.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Committee oversees the governance agenda on behalf of the Board and considers papers and proposals issued by Government, regulatory bodies and investor groups, and their application to Landsec.\n\nThe Committee also has a role to play in ensuring that the decisions taken by the Board and its Committees are made in the best interests of the Company and that they address any wider implications that may a/ffect stakeholders.\n\n## External evaluation of the e/ffectiveness of the Nomination Committee\n\nThe external review of the performance of the Nomination Committee has led to a reassessment of the Committee's priorities in the two years ahead. The forward agendas for the Committee have been restructured to make the Committee more systematic and proactive, driving succession planning at Board and Executive Leadership Team and with more detailed reporting back to the main Board.",

In particular, the Board asked management to undertake a review of how Landsec went into the pandemic and how we came out of it, and how our business resilience has improved as a result.\n\nThe Board is conscious that with continued uncertainty ahead, /financial, strategic and operational /flexibility, agility and resilience remain key and a focus for the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People and talent pipeline\n\nThe Board would like more visibility of potential and talent coming up through senior management with greater exposure to the Executive Leadership Team and its direct reports both formally in meetings and through informal drinks and dinners.\n\nTalent development and succession has been an increased focus of the Board throughout the year. Mark Allan attended the Non-executive Director dinner held in March to share his view of talent within the business.\n\nMembers of the Executive Leadership Team and their direct reports have spent time with Board members at site visits and presenting to the Board at formal meetings. Further opportunities will be sought for more informal interactions over the course of the coming year.\n\n## Workforce engagement and culture\n\nThe Board would like more opportunities to meet with employees to follow up on themes raised at the Employee Forum and will allow the Non-executive Directors to hear directly about matters that concern employees. Continued emphasis on workforce engagement will also enable the Board to gain a greater insight into culture at Landsec and the shift in culture that the business is striving to achieve.\n\nThis year we introduced our Nonexecutive Director/employee breakfast events. This is an opportunity for eight employees to have breakfast with two of our Non-executive Directors to have an informal discussion about any aspect of working life at Landsec. Our Non-executive Directors have also attended the Employee Forum and Manjiry Tamhane joined a session with our Womens' Network.\n\nMore detail on our workforce engagement can be found on page 90\n\n## Output of 2021/22 Board evaluation: areas of focus for the year ahead\n\n## Succession planning\n\nContinue to evolve the Board to meet the needs of the business and to work e/ffectively with management.\n\nA key part of this is Board and Executive Leadership Team succession.

The Board is collaborative and open and is addressing the right issues in the right way.\n\nOur new CEO and CFO have made a signi/ficant impact to the working of the Board and together with the COO, form a strong and e/ffective Executive Director team, bringing an excellent balance of skills and experience.\n\n## Topic\n\n## Feedback from the Board\n\nStrategy development and business transformation\n\n- \u2192 There has been a concerted focus on developing a new strategy for Landsec and this is felt by all the Board members to have gone well\n\nCulture change, engagement and operating environment\n\n- \u2192 All the Board agreed that cultural change is an essential part of moving Landsec forward successfully and the Board needs to monitor this closely\n\nRisk appetite and risk management\n\n- \u2192 The Board members have embraced the decision to change the approach to risk management in the business\n\nSuccession planning for the Board/uni00A0and Executive\n\n- \u2192 There is overall buy-in to Landsec being prepared to take more risks, but calculated risks. Exercising the right amount of challenge on this will be the most crucial role for the Board to perform in the years ahead\n- \u2192 All are agreed that health and safety is a key priority to manage e/ffectively, with the Board having a clear responsibility for oversight\n- \u2192 At present, the Non-executive Directors feel the level of risk across the business is well contained\n- \u2192 Executive succession planning is seen by everyone as a clear priority for Landsec\n- \u2192 A detailed analysis of the skills gap against the future organisation, strategy and plans, including the use of data, will be essential\n- \u2192 The Board would /find it helpful to become much closer to the plans for and progress in developing Landsec's people and building the talent pipeline\n- \u2192 The future business environment for Landsec and the industry as a whole, post the pandemic, is still unclear. This means that although a strategy has been agreed, being nimble and agile as the conditions change and future trends become clearer will be essential\n\nThe Board agenda and topics have the right focus on strategy, balanced with operational updates and the Chairman sets an inclusive and collaborative tone.\n\nThe Board would like to continue to focus on talent, diversity, data and ESG, all of which are crucial for the successful execution of our strategy. Becoming a leader in ESG is likely to be a key di/fferentiator for all our stakeholders and the Board would like to stay close to the progress being made.\n\nThe Board will continue to focus on how Landsec uses data to transform the business with the right systems and IT infrastructure, assessing what data is needed and how it is analysed and applied.\n\nThe table below sets out more detail on the outputs of the evaluation.

We also used the lines of defence model and assurance mapping to monitor how we manage and assure our principal risks.\n\nA key operational risk that was focused on throughout the year was information security and cyber threat. A risk management strategy has been established to identify, prioritise and improve cyber resilience across all our assets and corporate systems and the Committee will continue to monitor progress.\n\n## Climate reporting\n\nIn February, the Committee had a session with our sustainability team and our auditor Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to discuss the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and what this means for the Audit Committee.\n\nLandsec has already taken key steps towards improving its climate risk disclosures and a series of metrics were already disclosed annually, which are in line with the TCFD recommendations. It was helpful however to discuss how the Audit Committee needs to focus on how the impact of climate change has been\n\nconsidered in the preparation of the /financial statements, how the risks and opportunities have been re/flected and if the assessment of viability over the longer term is taking into account climate related issues.\n\nI can con/firm that Landsec has made disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations and the Committee will continue to monitor disclosures going forward.\n\nOur TCFD disclosures can be found on pages 66-69\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Group's /financial statements are of critical importance to investors and the Committee monitors the integrity of the Group's reporting process and /financial management. It scrutinises the full and half-yearly /financial statements before proposing them to the Board for approval. The Committee reviews in detail the work of the external auditor and external valuer and any signi/ficant /financial judgements and estimates made by management to ensure that it is satis/fied with the outcome.\n\n## Asset valuation\n\nThe valuation of our assets is an important constituent of our /financial results and measurement of our performance. We use CBRE, an industry-leading agency, to provide us with an external valuation of our portfolio twice a year. CBRE has extensive expertise and knowledge and uses this to provide us with a valuation prepared in accordance with the relevant industry standards.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Independent Review of Valuations that was published this year. Generally the governance and structures that we have in place and our improvement plans in progress, are broadly aligned to the recommendations in the review. However, we have identi/fied potential areas of enhancement to consider and will work with our external valuers to address these points in the year ahead.\n\nNicholas Cadbury Chairman of Audit Committee\n\n## Committee members\n\n- \u2192 Nicholas Cadbury (Chairman)\n- \u2192 Madeleine Cosgrave\n- \u2192 Stacey Rauch (until 1 June 2021)\n- \u2192 Christophe Evain (from 1 June 2021)\n\n## Highlights\n\n- \u2192 Continued focus on integrity of/uni00A0reporting process\n- \u2192 Rigorous assessment of risk management and internal controls\n- \u2192 Cyber and information security\n- \u2192 Accounting treatment of signi/ficant acquisitions and disposals\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u2192 Reliability of the /financial statements and internal controls\n- \u2192 E/ffective risk identi/fication and/uni00A0management\n- \u2192 Overall transparency and /financial governance\n\n## Number of meetings and attendance\n\n- \u2192 Four scheduled meetings\n- \u2192 100% attendance from all members during their membership",

The Committee analyses, challenges and debates the valuations prepared by CBRE. Further, the external valuation process and the values ascribed to speci/fic assets are also reviewed independently by our auditor, EY, as part of its audit scope.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals\n\nDuring the year, in the execution of its new strategy, Landsec sold Harbour Exchange, acquired 75% of MediaCity, increased its stake in Bluewater and in addition acquired U+I Group PLC. The Committee discussed the accounting treatment of these material transactions and concluded they were appropriate.\n\n## Provisions for bad debt\n\nOver the year, the Committee has closely monitored the cash collections of rents across the whole portfolio and by the end of the year we saw cash collections return to pre-pandemic levels. However, bad debt provisions remain in respect of some occupiers who have been unable to satisfy their rent obligations. This analysis involves a signi/ficant amount of judgement therefore the Committee continues to monitor the provisions remaining.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nLandsec's internal audit team is within the wider Risk and Assurance Function. The Committee believes that this works well based on the quality of the reporting from the Director of Risk and Assurance.\n\nThe Committee commissioned an external review of the scope, skills and competencies of Internal Audit during the year. This con/firmed that the knowledge, skills and resources of our internal team remain appropriate and are supported by specialist external expertise as and when needed.\n\nThis year, the internal audit plan has reviewed matters including our recent acquisitions at MediaCity and U+I, our /flexible o/ffice product (Myo), our cultural framework, cyber security and UK Data Protection compliance. In the year ahead, the internal audit plan includes reviews for turnover rent, major developments and key outsourced service providers.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nFollowing discussion, the Committee concluded and recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole, the Company's 2022 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable. Our assessment included climate change matters.\n\n## Going concern and viability statement\n\nWe continue to focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022. The going concern statement is set out on page 70.\n\nThe viability statement, together with the rationale behind the chosen /five-year time horizon, is also set out on page 70.\n\n## Audit tender\n\nThe Group's audit was put out to tender in 2013, with EY performing its /first audit for the year ended 31 March 2014. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, we are required to tender our audit, on a comply or explain basis, every ten years. Therefore, we are currently carrying out a competitive tender with the successful auditor signing the 31 March 2024 accounts.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code/ Financial Reporting Council (FRC/parenright.case Guidance on Audit Committees\n\nThe Committee considered its compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees. We believe that we have addressed both the spirit and the requirements of each.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Committee e/ffectiveness\n\nThe composition of the Committee changed on 1 June 2021 when Stacey Rauch stepped down and Christophe Evain became an Audit Committee member. We welcome Christophe's contribution to the Committee.\n\nThe Committee's performance was considered as part of the external Board evaluation conducted this year. The conclusion is that we operate to a high standard, with clear priorities, well de/fined responsibilities and clarity around our work plan. We are also currently carrying out an in-depth internal review of the work of the Committee to ensure that the Committee's focus remains on the appropriate areas.\n\nI would like to thank the other members of the Committee, together with management, CBRE and EY, for their support during the year. I hope that you /find this review, and the report that follows, a helpful explanation of the work of the Committee.\n\nNicholas Cadbury Chairman, Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

The terms of reference are available on our website: landsec.com/aboutcorporate-governance/ board-committees.\n\nTo maintain e/ffective communication between all relevant parties, and in support of its activities, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Chief Financial O/fficer, Company Secretary, Director of Risk and Assurance, the partner and representatives of our external auditor, EY, and other members of the senior /finance team regularly attend Committee meetings.\n\nAll Directors are invited to attend meetings when the Group's external valuer, CBRE, presents its full year and half-year property valuation.\n\nThe Committee Chairman has private and informal sessions with the EY audit team and the CBRE valuation team to ensure that open lines of communication exist, in case they wish to raise any concerns outside of formal meetings.\n\nThe Committee members are all independent Non-executive Directors and collectively have a broad range of /financial, commercial and property sector expertise that enables them to provide oversight of both /financial and risk matters, and to advise the Board accordingly. The Board has determined that Nicholas Cadbury, as Chairman of the Committee, has recent and relevant /financial experience for the purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate Governance Code. Details of the experience of all members of the Committee can be found on pages 76 and 77.",

Following each meeting, the Committee Chairman reports on the main discussion points and /findings to the Board.\n\nIn addition to bene/fiting from a session with EY on TCFD, the Committee also had a deep dive session with EY on the Government's proposals on restoring trust in audit and corporate governance, discussing what the impact of the proposals would be for Landsec and the Audit Committee, including the proposed publication of a resilience statement, audit and assurance policy and mandatory shared audits.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management framework and risk appetite. The Committee supports the Board in the management of risk and is responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of risk management and internal control processes during the year.\n\nAn overview of the risk management process, the changes to the impact and likelihood of risks over the year and the key risk management priorities for 2022/23 are described on page 58. This includes the Executive Leadership Team's detailed review of the business risks, controls and mitigation strategies which forms the basis for the principal risks, before being assessed by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe risk dashboard uses indicators to track whether each risk level is within our appetite and this triggers discussion by the Committee as to how the principal risks are moving and whether the risk tolerance ranges remain appropriate.\n\nYou can read about our principal risks and/uni00A0the changes to risk levels this year on/uni00A0 pages 60-65\n\nPrimary responsibility for the operation of the Company's internal control and risk management systems, which extend to include /financial, operational and compliance controls (and accord with the FRC's 2014 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting'), has been delegated to management. These systems have been designed to manage, rather than eliminate,\n\nthe risk of failure to achieve the Group's business goals and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Risk assurance and internal control\n\nUnder the overall supervision of the Committee, there are several subcommittees and working groups that give assurance over risks being managed within the business. The Group has a Director of Risk and Assurance (with a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee Chairman) who provides regular oversight of risk matters, evaluates emerging risks and monitors compliance to ensure that any mitigating actions are properly managed and completed. The Committee, in consultation with management, agrees the annual work plan of the Risk and Assurance function to ensure alignment with the needs of the business.\n\nInternal audits are carried out in accordance with an agreed annual assurance plan and reviewed by the Committee throughout the year.\n\nThe Internal Audit team also provide assurance to the Committee on key controls and programme assurance and used its data analytics capability to improve the identi/fication of any issues in key /financial processes, such as accounts payable and service charge management.\n\nThe key elements of the Group's risk management and internal control systems are as follows:\n\n- \u2192 an established organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility, approval levels and delegated authorities\n- \u2192 a disciplined management and committee structure which facilitates regular performance review and decision-making\n- \u2192 a comprehensive strategic review and annual planning process\n- \u2192 a robust budgeting, forecasting and /financial reporting process\n- \u2192 various policies, procedures and guidelines underpinning the development, asset management and /financing operations of the business\n- \u2192 a compliance certi/fication process conducted in relation to the half-yearly and full year results, and business activities generally\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n103\n\n- \u2192 a quarterly key controls self-certi/fication by management\n- \u2192 an internal audit function whose work spans the whole Group\n- \u2192 a focused post-acquisition review and integration programme to ensure the Group's governance, procedures, standards and control environment are implemented e/ffectively and on time\n- \u2192 a /financial and property information management system\n- \u2192 a whistleblowing process that enables concerns to be reported con/fidentially and on an anonymous basis and for those concerns to be investigated.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee discusses on a quarterly basis:\n\n- \u2192 the Group's signi/ficant and emerging risks, and how exposures have changed during the period\n- \u2192 the e/ffectiveness of internal controls and processes at mitigating those risks\n- \u2192 internal audit reports, summary reports of /findings and recommendations from completion of the internal audit plan\n- \u2192 progress against completion of agreed actions from Internal Audit reports.\n\n## External auditor\n\nEY are Landsec's external auditor and are engaged to conduct a statutory audit and express an opinion on the Company's and the Group's /financial statements.\n\nTheir audit scope includes a review of the property valuation process and methodology using its own chartered surveyors (more details below), to the extent necessary to express an audit opinion.\n\nWhen carrying out its statutory audit work, EY also has access to a broader range of employees and di/fferent parts of the business. If it picks up any information as part of this process, it would report to the Audit Committee anything that it believes the Committee should know in order to ful/fil its duties and responsibilities. As audit partner, Kathryn Barrow is authorised to contact the Committee Chairman directly at any time to raise any matter of concern.",

The objective was to ensure that the focus of its work remained aligned to the Group's structure and new strategy.\n\nThe Committee is keen to ensure that its auditor feels able to challenge management and is a/fforded all the access it requires to report on matters that may not be part of the statutory audit but which, in the opinion of the auditor, should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee. These matters may be /financial or non-/financial and may be based on fact or opinion (including any concern over culture or behaviour). An example may be the use or adequacy of any controls used by the Company to detect any fraud or improper behaviour.\n\nEY is a/fforded such access through attendance at each Committee meeting, supported by other meetings held during the year with the Committee Chairman without management being present and the knowledge that it can raise any matter of concern to the Committee Chairman at any time without going through management. These regular discussions were useful to the Committee but no matters of concern emerged.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. In undertaking its annual assessment, the Committee took into account the UK Ethical Independence Standards introduced by the FRC in December 2019 and e/ffective from 15 March 2020.\n\nThe Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u2192 the con/firmation from EY that it maintains appropriate internal safeguards in line with applicable professional standards, together with an explanation of the due diligence process followed to provide such a con/firmation\n- \u2192 the mitigation actions we take in seeking to safeguard EY's independent status, including the operation of policies designed to regulate the amount of non-audit services provided by EY and the employment of former EY employees\n- \u2192 the tenure of the audit engagement partner (not being greater than /five years); Kathryn Barrow was appointed as EY audit partner to the Group in June 2018\n- \u2192 the internal performance and e/ffectiveness review of EY referred to above.\n\nNo Committee member has any connection with the current auditor.\n\nTaking the above review into account, the Committee concluded that EY remained objective and independent in its role as external auditor.\n\n## E/ffectiveness of the external audit\n\nFollowing the issue of our Annual Report each year, the Director of Risk and Assurance conducts a performance evaluation and e/ffectiveness review of the external audit. This is conducted against structured guidelines in consultation with the Executive Directors and members of the senior /finance team and members of the Audit Committee to whom they report. The Committee Chairman meets privately with the audit engagement partner before the Committee meeting to consider the results of the e/ffectiveness review. The Committee's preliminary view is that EY has continued to perform its audit services\n\ne/ffectively and to a high standard, and this is consistent with performance each year since appointment in 2013. Areas identi/fied for development will be shared with EY for inclusion in its audit and service delivery plans going forward.\n\n## Audit tendering\n\nEY was /first appointed to the o/ffice of auditor, following a competitive tender process, in respect of the 2013/14 /financial year.\n\nUnder current regulations, we are required to retender the audit by no later than the 2023/24 /financial year. An audit tender process is underway and the successful auditor will be appointed to perform its /first audit for the 31 March 2024 /financial year.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board is proposing a resolution at this year's Annual General Meeting that EY be reappointed to o/ffice for the 31 March 2023 /financial year.\n\nThe Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the year under review.\n\n## Audit fee\n\nThe audit fees payable to EY for 2021/22 (including the audit of the Group's joint ventures) are \u00a31.8m (2020/21: \u00a31.4m).\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nTo help safeguard EY's objectivity and independence, we operate a non-audit services policy that sets out the circumstances and /financial limits within which EY may be permitted to provide certain non-audit services.",

It was decided that it would be in the interest of the Company to use EY for these services, recognising that the use of audit /firms for non-audit work should generally be kept to a minimum. Total fees for non-audit services, including the half-yearly review and other assurance-related services, amounted to \u00a3205,000. Details of the fees charged by EY during the year can be found in note 8 to the /financial statements.\n\nThe total of \u00a3205,000 paid for non-audit services represented 12.9% of the Group audit fee payable to EY during the year (excluding the audit of the Group's joint ventures). No non-audit fees were approved or paid on a contingent basis.\n\n## External valuations and valuers\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio, including properties held within the development programme and in joint arrangements, is undertaken by external valuers. The Group provides input, such as source data, and support to the valuation process. CBRE has been the Company's principal valuer since 2015 and was reappointed in 2019 for a further three-year period. Additionally this year, Savills (UK) Limited (Savills) was engaged to perform the valuation of the MediaCity portfolio and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) was engaged to perform the valuation of part of the U+I Group PLC portfolio.\n\nThe valuation helps to determine a signi/ficant part of the Group's total property return and net asset value, which have consequential implications for the Group's reported performance and the level of variable remuneration received by senior management through bonus and long-term incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny of each valuation and the valuer's objectivity and e/ffectiveness represent an important part of the Committee's work.\n\nValuations for the full and half-year were presented to the Committee by CBRE. These were reviewed and challenged by the Committee, with reference to CBRE's approach, methodology, valuation basis and underlying property and market assumptions. Other Non-executive Directors attended the full and half-year presentations. The Committee Chairman and other members of the Committee also had separate meetings with CBRE as part of this process to provide an opportunity to test and challenge the valuation outcomes and the principles and evidence used in the determination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally, CBRE, Savills and JLL met with EY and exchanged information independently of management. EY has experienced chartered surveyors on its team who consider the valuer's quali/fications and assess and challenge the valuation approach, assumptions and judgements made by them. Their audit procedures are targeted at addressing the risks in respect of the valuations and the potential for any undue management in/fluence in arriving at them. This year EY identi/fied 32 properties (comprising 72% of the portfolio) for substantive review by its valuation experts primarily on the basis of their value, type, risk pro/file and location. The Committee reviewed the auditor's /findings.\n\nAn internal evaluation of CBRE's performance and e/ffectiveness will be conducted after the year-end results are /finalised with the results reported to the Committee.\n\nA /fixed-fee arrangement (subject to adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) is in place with CBRE for the valuation of the Group's properties and, given the importance of their work, we have disclosed the fees paid to them in note 9 to the /financial statements. The total valuation fees paid by the Company to CBRE, Savills and JLL during the year represented less than 5% of their total fee income for the year.\n\n## Signi/ficant /financial matters\n\nThe Committee reviewed three signi/ficant /financial matters in connection with the /financial statements, namely the valuation of the Group's property portfolio, revenue recognition, and the accounting for the acquisition of U+I Group PLC. Further details are set out in the table on page 107.\n\nThese items were considered to be signi/ficant taking into account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management and, in respect of the valuation, the external valuer. The Committee discussed these with both parties, as well as EY.",

As noted in the Brydon Report, the purpose of the audit should go further than the /financial statements and help to establish and maintain deserved con/fidence in a company, in its directors and information for which they have responsibility in the Annual Report.\n\nWe report on alternative performance measures on page 211. The Committee debated and discussed these measures and agreed that they were appropriate for the business.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee applied the same due diligence approach adopted in previous years in order to assess whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, one of the key UK Corporate Governance Code requirements. The Committee received assurance from the veri/fication process carried out on the content of the Annual Report by the Executive Leadership Team to ensure consistent reporting and the existence of appropriate links between key messages and relevant sections of the Annual Report. Particular attention has been given this year to the consistency of the narrative disclosures around climate risks, our strategy and the /financial statements.\n\nTaking the above into account, together with the views expressed by EY, the Committee recommended, and in turn the Board con/firmed, that the 2022 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Whistleblowing policy\n\nThe Board receives a whistleblowing report twice a year and has overall responsibility for whistleblowing but the Audit Committee supports the Board in this respect. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's Speak up policy which allows employees to report concerns about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing (whether /financial or otherwise) on a con/fidential basis, and anonymously if preferred. This includes an independent third-party reporting facility comprising a telephone hotline and an alternative online process. Any matters reported are investigated by the Company Secretary, Managing Director, People and Corporate Services and the Director of Risk and Assurance and escalated to the Committee, as appropriate. During the year, no whistleblowing incidents were reported.\n\nWe monitor whistleblowing awareness and remind employees that a dedicated hotline exists should they ever need to 'blow the whistle'. The arrangements also form part of the induction programme for new employees. Details of the whistleblowing hotline are included in our Sustainability Charter and procurement tender documentation.",

At the start of the year Covid-19 dominated the news and there was much uncertainty. As the year progressed, the Landsec team worked hard to deliver the strategy we set out last year and I thank colleagues, customers and partners alike who showed commitment and tenacity to deliver the positive /financial and wider business outcomes detailed in this Annual Report.\n\n## Directors' remuneration policy\n\nThis year we have operated under the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at our 2021 AGM.\n\nWe consulted with our major shareholders, the main shareholder representatives and with our people and the policy received a positive vote of 96.4%. The Committee believes that the policy provides strong alignment with best practice in corporate governance and an appropriate level of /flexibility to allow meaningful incentivisation to deliver our ambitious strategy.\n\n## Performance for the 2021/22 /financial year\n\nDuring the course of the year we have driven our business forward, making acquisitions and disposals that will accelerate the delivery of our strategy and provide greater opportunities for growth.\n\nWe are a purpose-led business and aim to/uni00A0create value for all stakeholders. Our strategy focuses on shaping three distinct places - Central London o/ffices; Major retail destinations; and Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods - and we have made signi/ficant progress in all three areas over the last year while maintaining a strong /financial position.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2022, EPRA Earnings were up 41.4%. Adjusted EPRA earnings per share were also up 41.6% to/uni00A048.0p. Asset values increased by 3.6% in/uni00A0aggregate re/flecting record leasing in London o/ffices, growth returning in major retail destinations and clear progress on our/uni00A0objective to grow in mixed-use urban neighbourhoods. This resulted in a 7.9% increase in EPRA net tangible assets per share to 1,063p.\n\nThese results are clearly re/flected in the variable pay awarded to the Executive Directors in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Annual bonus performance\n\nThe performance of the executive team has/uni00A0been both focused and decisive, with/uni00A0progress made in all areas of the plan that was set out at the start of the year. We have a healthy pipeline of capital reinvestment projects and increased clarity of the risks and opportunities in our capital recycling programme. We have made some signi/ficant investments and our positive business performance re/flects the capability and commitment of our teams, despite the challenging environment that everyone has been operating in.\n\nThe Committee has carefully considered the/uni00A0business outcomes and the wider stakeholder context (see our discretion framework on page 113). The Committee believes that it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to receive annual bonuses for 2021/22.\n\nThe Committee set the annual bonus targets at the start of the year during a period of great uncertainty. As the year unfolded and as the timing in respect of disposals became clearer, the Committee carefully reviewed the EPRA Earnings targets and increased them, to make them more stretching. In addition the Committee agreed to exercise downward discretion to remove the positive e/ffect of the pandemic on energy intensity, which forms part of the ESG element of the annual bonus.\n\nChristophe Evain\n\nChairman, Remuneration Committee\n\n## Committee members\n\n- \u2192 Christophe Evain/one.numr\n- \u2192 Edward Bonham Carter\n- \u2192 Cressida Hogg\n- \u2192 Manjiry Tamhane/two.numr\n- \u2192 Stacey Rauch/three.numr\n\n## Highlights\n\n- \u2192 New Policy Approved\n- \u2192 LTIP extended to senior management\n- \u2192 Workforce engagement\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u2192 Reviewing the link between reward and the Group's purpose and strategy\n- \u2192 Oversight of reward matters across the Group\n- \u2192 Maintaining a strong connection between returns to/uni00A0shareholders and reward for/uni00A0Executives\n\n## Number of meetings and attendance\n\n- \u2192 Four scheduled meetings\n- \u2192 100% attendance from all/uni00A0members during their/uni00A0membership\n- 1.

        "page_content": "This resulted in overall bonus outcomes of/uni00A087.4% to 90.4% of maximum (equating to/uni00A0131.1% to 135.6% of salary), which is considered to be appropriate in the context of the performance of the business.\n\nSee page 116 for further details\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan performance\n\nVesting of the 2019 LTIP in 2022 is determined by performance against two equallyweighted measures of Total Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350 real estate companies. Performance under both measures over the three years to 31 March 2022 was below the threshold level and as such there will be no vesting in respect of the 2019 LTIP award. In addition, Mark Allan's buyout award, measured against the same targets as the 2019 LTIP award, albeit over two years to 31 March 2022, will also not vest.\n\n## Management changes\n\nAs previously disclosed, Martin Greenslade stepped down as CFO on 31 May 2021 and his employment with Landsec ended on 29 September 2021. Vanessa Simms joined the Board on 4 May 2021 as CFO designate and assumed the role of CFO on 1 June 2021. Full details of the remuneration arrangements relating to this change were disclosed in the 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Discretion\n\nNo positive discretion was exercised in the year ended 31 March 2022. Details of the negative discretion applied by the Committee to the annual bonus awards are set out in the annual bonus performance section above and in more detail on page 116.\n\n## Executive remuneration 2022/23\n\n## 1. Base salary\n\nAs disclosed in our last Annual Report, base salaries are due for review in 2022. Mark Allan was appointed CEO in April 2020 and Vanessa Simms was appointed CFO in June 2021 and no increases have been applied since appointment. Colette O'Shea's salary was last reviewed in January 2020. From 1 June 2022, Executive Director salaries will increase by 3%, which is below the workforce average of 5%.\n\n## 2. Pension\n\nConsistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Executive Directors' pension contributions are aligned to the wider workforce at 10.5% of salary.\n\n## 3. Annual bonus\n\nFor the year ending 31 March 2023, Executive Directors will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 150% of salary. Our simpli/fied bonus scheme remains appropriate to our strategy and combines stretching targets for earnings, total return and ESG based on milestone targets for the year ending 31 March 2023. Personal objectives will continue to be operated for a minority of the award. Further detail is provided on page 121.\n\n## 4. Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nWe intend to grant awards under the LTIP in June 2022, which will be subject to performance conditions over a three-year performance period. Performance targets will continue to be based on total accounting return, relative TSR, and carbon reduction. Any awards which vest will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. Further detail is provided on page 121.\n\n## Remuneration across the Company\n\nThe Committee oversees all remuneration policies and practices across the organisation, and is regularly briefed by the MD, People and Corporate Services in this regard. The Committee takes account of the interests of all internal and external stakeholders when making any decisions on remuneration matters. During the year ended 31 March 2022, we broadened the eligibility criteria for LTIP awards below the Executive Leadership Team, more closely aligning those who execute our strategy on a daily basis with the interests of our shareholders.\n\n## Gender and Ethnicity pay gaps\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Committee was pleased to see that the Company's gender pay gap had improved. However, we are aware that further progress is required here and continue to review management's response to this important topic. For the /first time last year, management published the ethnicity pay gap, ahead of any formal regulations, and it is evident there is much progress still to be made. More information can be found on page 38 and on the Company's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee voice\n\nI took the opportunity to meet with members of our Employee Forum in early 2022. This is an important activity and I was pleased to answer a number of questions posed by the forum. In particular, I noted the wider use of LTIPs amongst senior management was welcomed by the forum, bringing greater alignment with shareholders. In addition, the forum con/firmed that the simpli/fied bonus scheme for sta/ff had been very well received. Finally, the shift from relative total property return to absolute total accounting return was much appreciated as a more easily understood and relevant measure of performance. More generally, a number of the Non-Executive Directors met with employees during the year, as detailed on page 90.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite the disruption and changing nature of society as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Landsec's performance has been most encouraging.\n\nI hope that you have found my letter useful, informative and clear. I am grateful for the engagement and support provided by our shareholders, and welcome your feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristophe Evain\n\nChairman, Remuneration Committee",

In respect of his remuneration arrangements he:\n\n- \u2192 received his normal remuneration in terms of basic salary, pension allowance, car allowance and company bene/fits, in accordance with his service agreement, up to 29 September 2021. The total value for the period from 1 June to 29 September was \u00a3217,362 (less all necessary deductions);\n- \u2192 was awarded an annual bonus award for the three month period from 1 April 2021 to 30 June 2021 of \u00a3171,022, which was paid at the same time and on the same basis as the Company's Executive Directors. \u00a365,231 was paid in cash and \u00a3105,791 was deferred into shares under the Landsec Deferred Share Bonus Plan 2021 (the DSBP). Re/flecting that the handover process was completed on 30 June 2021, no/uni00A0bonus was awarded for the period 1 July 2021 to 29 September 2021 when his employment ended;\n- \u2192 was treated as a good leaver in respect of his outstanding unvested options granted under the DSBP. Such awards granted/to be granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 vested/will continue to vest on the normal vesting dates; and\n- \u2192 was treated as a good leaver in respect of his outstanding unvested share awards under the Landsec Long-Term Incentive Plan 2015 (the LTIP). In accordance with the rules of the LTIP, Mr Greenslade's unvested LTIPs will vest on their normal vesting dates, subject to satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and on a time pro-rated basis. In this regard, his 2018 LTIP lapsed in full in 2021, and his 2019 LTIP will lapse in full in 2022, as a result of failing to hit the relevant threshold performance targets. His pro-rated 2020 LTIP award remains outstanding.\n\n## 1.3 Annual bonus outturn\n\nIn the year under review, Executive Directors had the potential to receive a maximum annual bonus of up to 150% of base salary. Of this, 120% of salary was dependent on meeting Group targets and 30% of salary was dependent on meeting personal objectives. All targets were set at the beginning of the year. The following table con/firms the targets and their respective outcomes.\n\n| Annual bonus performance 2021/22           | Annual bonus performance 2021/22   | Annual bonus performance 2021/22                                                                                               | Annual bonus performance 2021/22   | Annual bonus performance 2021/22       | Annual bonus performance 2021/22   | Annual bonus performance 2021/22      | Table 37                     |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Measure                                    | Weighting                          | Description                                                                                                                    | Performance outcome                | Performance outcome                    | Performance outcome                | Performance outcome                   | Outturn                      |\n|                                            |                                    |                                                                                                                                | Threshold                          | Target                                 | Maximum                            | Actual                                |                              |\n| EPRA Earnings (/sterling.tfm)              | /three.tf/zero.tf%                 | EPRA Earnings targets in line with overall  /five-year strategic plan /one.tf .                                                | /three.tf/one.tf /one.tf./four.tf  | /three.tf /two.tf /seven.tf. /eight.tf | /three.tf /six.tf /zero.tf./six.tf | /three.tf /five.tf /four.tf ./nine.tf | /two.tf/seven.tf./four.tf%   |\n| Total accounting return  (pence per share) | /three.tf/zero.tf%                 | Delivery of growth in asset values measured by  EPRA NTA growth (adjusted for dividends)  through pro-active asset management. | /five.tfp                          | /two.tf /seven.tf. /five.tf p          | /five.tf/zero.tfp                  | /one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf p            | /three.tf/zero.tf%           |\n| ESG                                        | /one.tf/zero.tf%                   | Energy intensity reduction in all assets/two.numr.                                                                             | /three.tf. /five.tf %              | /four.tf%                              | /five.tf%                          | /four.tf%                             | /five.tf%                    |\n|                                            | /one.tf/zero.tf%                   | Embodied carbon reduction in assets under  development.                                                                        | /one.tf/six.tf%                    | /one.tf/six.tf./five.tf%               | /one.tf/seven.tf%                  | /two.tf /zero.tf./seven.tf %          | /one.tf/zero.tf%             |\n| Personal objectives                        | /two.tf/zero.tf%                   | A mix of individual goals set at the beginning  of the year.                                                                   | /zero.tf%                          | /five.tf/zero.tf%                      | /one.tf/zero.tf /zero.tf %         | See table /three.tf/eight.tf          | /one.tf/seven.tf%/three.numr |\n| Total annual bonus                         | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%           |                                                                                                                                |                                    |                                        |                                    |                                       | /eight.tf/nine.tf./four.tf%  |\n\n- /one.tf.

Demonstrating momentum in execution was a signi/ficant priority for  the year, with good progress made with the acquisitions of U/plus.tfI and  MediaCity in particular. In addition, the restructure of the retail business has already started  to deliver positive outcomes, as evidenced by leasing momentum  and in London, the team has successfully unlocked value creation  opportunities in a very competitive market. Finally, the Committee noted that asset level plans are now in  place across the urban mixed-use and retail portfolios where none  existed previously. During the year, the MI pack has been comprehensively restructured  and the timetable for delivery materially accelerated.

The outturn is adjusted to take account of the performance of trading properties.\n\nIn addition, one third of Mark Allan's May 2020 buyout award, as assessed on the same performance targets as the 2020 LTIP awards, albeit over a two year performance period, was similarly assessed to be below threshold for both TSR and TPR with 0% vesting.\n\n## 2. Directors' interests\n\n## 2.1 Total shareholding (Audited)\n\nDetails of the Directors' interests, including those of their immediate families and connected persons, in the issued share capital of the Company at the beginning and end of the year, together with their required shareholding, are set out in the table below.\n\nExecutive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within /five years of appointment to the Board. Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.\n\n| Directors' shares Name     | Salary/  base fee at  /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf (/sterling.tf)   | Minimum  shareholding  requirements  (% of salary/ base fee)   | Required holding  value (/sterling.tf)                    | Holding (ordinary shares) /one.tf April /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | Holding (ordinary shares) /three.tf/one.tf March  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | Deferred bonus shares under holding  period   | Value of   holding  (/sterling.tf) /one.tf                   | Table 41 Compliant  with policy   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Mark Allan                 | /eight.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                                           | /three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf%                                     | /two.tf,/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/nine.tf/three.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/two.tf                        | /two.tf/one.tf/four.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/one.tf                                   | /one.tf/four.tf,/two.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf     | /one.tf,/seven.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/two.tf    | Yes                               |\n| Martin Greenslade/two.numr | -

An additional line to illustrate the Company's performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous ten years is also included.\n\nThis graph shows the value, by 31 March 2022, of \u00a3100 invested in Landsec on 31 March 2012, compared with the value of \u00a3100 invested in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 Real Estate Indices on the same date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following table shows remuneration for the Chief Executive over a period of ten years.\n\n| Chief Executive remuneration over ten years   | Chief Executive remuneration over ten years   |                                                                             |                                         | Table 51 Long-term  incentive vesting   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Year                                          | Chief Executive                               | Single /figure of total remuneration (/sterling.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf) | Annual bonus   payment   (% of maximum) | (% of maximum)                          |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf                 | Mark Allan                                    | /two.tf,/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                                            | /nine.tf/zero.tf./four.tf               | /zero.tf./zero.tf                       |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                 | Mark Allan                                    | /two.tf,/nine.tf/two.tf/zero.tf /one.tf                                     | /one.tf/six.tf./two.tf                  | n/a                                     |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                             | /four.tf/three.tf./eight.tf             | /zero.tf./zero.tf                       |\n| /two.tf /zero.tf /one.tf/nine.tf              | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/four.tf                                              | /five.tf/zero.tf./five.tf               | /zero.tf./zero.tf                       |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /one.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/three.tf                                            | /five.tf/eight.tf./eight.tf             | /zero.tf./zero.tf                       |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/seven.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/six.tf/nine.tf/two.tf                                              | /five.tf/eight.tf./eight.tf             | /five.tf/zero.tf./zero.tf               |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/six.tf                 | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/zero.tf/one.tf/one.tf                                              | /six.tf/seven.tf./five.tf               | /one.tf/three.tf./one.tf                |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/five.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /four.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/six.tf                                          | /nine.tf/four.tf./five.tf               | /eight.tf/four.tf./seven.tf             |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/four.tf                | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/two.tf/seven.tf/four.tf                                            | /seven.tf/one.tf./zero.tf               | /six.tf/two.tf./five.tf                 |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/three.tf               | Robert Noel                                   | /two.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf                                           | /eight.tf/six.tf./zero.tf               | /seven.tf/six.tf./one.tf                |\n\n- /one.tf.

Senior management\n\nFor the year under review, performance-related pay for our 35 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged from 33% to 87% of salary (2021: 17% to 27%), equating to 74% to 90% of the maximum potential. The average bonus was 51.4% of salary (2021: 19.7%), equating to 87.0% of the maximum potential. The LTIP awards made to senior management in June 2019 will vest on the same basis as the awards made to Executive Directors.\n\n## b. All other employees\n\nStandard pay increases for employees were not awarded due to the continued impact of the pandemic in 2021. Pay increases were reinstated in 2022 and will be detailed in next year's report. As at 31 March 2022, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive Directors) was 11:1 (\u00a3800,000: \u00a370,836).\n\n## c.

CEO pay ratio\n\nThe tables below show how pay for the CEO compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles (calculated on a full-time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, which uses the total pay and bene/fits for all employees, and is the same methodology that is used to calculate the CEO's single /figure of remuneration table on page 115. Figures are calculated by reference to 31 March 2022 using actual pay data from April 2021 to March 2022. Excluded from our analysis are joiners, leavers and long-term absentees from the Company during the year. The strong performance year, re/flected in the CEO's bonus payment, has increased the ratios relating to Option A since 2021. Given the alignment of incentive arrangements cascaded below Board level, the Remuneration Committee believes the pay ratios are consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the company's UK employees taken as a whole.\n\n| Year                           | Method           | /two.tf/five.tfth percentile pay ratio   | Median pay ratio         | Table 53 /seven.tf/five.tfth percentile pay ratio   |\n|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  | Option A         | /four.tf/zero.tf:/one.tf                 | /two.tf/five.tf:/one.tf  | /one.tf/six.tf:/one.tf                              |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | Option A /one.tf | /two.tf/two.tf:/one.tf                   | /one.tf/four.tf:/one.tf  | /one.tf/zero.tf:/one.tf                             |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | Option A         | /three.tf/six.tf:/one.tf                 | /two.tf/three.tf:/one.tf | /one.tf/five.tf:/one.tf                             |\n\n- /one.tf.

The Employee Bene/fit Trust held 888,400 ordinary shares (2021: 1,224,468) and 3,049,943 treasury shares (2021: n/a) at 31 March 2022.\n\nThe exercise of share options under the Land Securities Group PLC Sharesave (Sharesave), which is open to all employees who have completed more than one month's service with the Group, can be satis/fied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2022, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 635,473 shares (2021: 666,526), which represents less than 0.09% of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 7. Remuneration Committee meetings\n\nThe Committee met for four scheduled meetings over the course of the year. All members attended all the scheduled meetings. The Committee meetings were also attended by the Chief Executive, the MD, People and Corporate Services and the Company Secretary who acted as the Committee's Secretary.\n\nThe Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary share plan matters from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP. FIT are members of the Remuneration Consultants Group and are signatories to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The Committee is satis/fied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration for roles below the Board, the remuneration advisers have no other connection with the Group. For the /financial year under review FIT received fees of \u00a366,610 in connection with advice provided to the Committee. In 2020/21, Aon plc and FIT received fees of \u00a332,386 and \u00a378,184 respectively in connection with advice provided to the Committee.\n\n## 8.

An appointed Director must retire and seek election to o/ffice at the next Landsec AGM. In addition to any power of removal conferred by the Act, Landsec may by ordinary resolution remove any Director before the expiry of their period of o/ffice and may, subject to the Articles, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a Director in their place. In line with the Code and the Board's policy, all Directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.\n\n## Directors' powers\n\nThe Board manages the business of Landsec under the powers set out in the Articles. These powers include the Directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders' authority to empower the Directors to make market purchases of up to 10% of its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year. The Articles can only be amended, or new Articles adopted, by a resolution passed by shareholders in general meeting and being approved by at least three quarters of the votes cast.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nSave as disclosed in the Directors' Remuneration Report, none of the Directors, nor any person connected with them, has any interest in the share or loan capital of Landsec or any of its subsidiaries. At no time during the year ended 31 March 2022 did any Director hold a material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract of signi/ficance with Landsec or any subsidiary other than the Executive Directors in relation to their Service Agreements.",

A copy of the deed of indemnity is available for inspection at Landsec's registered o/ffice. Landsec has in place appropriate Directors' & O/fficers' Liability insurance cover in respect of potential legal action against its Directors.\n\n## Share capital\n\nLandsec has a single class of share capital which is divided into ordinary shares of nominal value 10 2 /3p each ranking pari passu. No other securities have been issued by the Company. At 31 March 2022, there were 751,328,142 ordinary shares in issue and fully paid. To satisfy future awards under the Company's shareholder approved employee share plans, on 3 June 2021, of the 9,839,179 existing shares held by the Company in Treasury, 3,049,943 were transferred to the Company's Employee Bene/fit Trust, leaving, 6,789,236 shares held in Treasury. The voting rights and dividend entitlements have been waived for the shares held by Treasury and the Employee Bene/fit Trust. This transfer has not a/ffected total number of voting rights. No shares were bought back during the year. Further details relating to share capital, including movements during the year, are set out in note 36 to the /financial statements.\n\nAt the Company's AGM held on 8 July 2021, shareholders authorised the Company to make market purchases of ordinary shares representing up to 10% of its issued share capital at that time and to allot shares within certain limits approved by shareholders. These authorities will expire\n\nat the 2022 AGM and a renewal of that authority will be sought.\n\nFrom 1 April 2022 to 16 May 2022, being the period from the year end through to the date on which this report has been signed we have received a number of DTR noti/fications from BlackRock, Inc., the latest of which was made on 16 May 2022 re/flecting a holding of 79,970,684 ordinary shares which constitutes a holding of 10.78%.

Information provided to the Company under the DTR is publicly available to view via the Investor section on the Company's website.\n\n## Employee bene/fit trust\n\nEquiniti Trust (Jersey) Limited continues as trustee (Trustee) of Landsec's Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). The EBT is used to purchase Land Securities Group PLC ordinary shares in the market from time to time for the bene/fit of employees, including to satisfy outstanding awards under Landsec's various employee share plans. The EBT did not purchase any shares in the market during the year (2021: 500,000). On 3 June 2021, 3,049,943 Treasury shares were transferred to the EBT. The EBT released 336,068 shares during the year to satisfy vested share plan awards.

There are no special control rights attaching to them save that the control rights of ordinary shares held in the EBT can be directed by the Company to satisfy the vesting of outstanding awards under its various employee share plans.\n\nIn relation to the EBT, the Trustee has agreed not to vote any shares held in the EBT at any general meeting. If any o/ffer is made to all shareholders to acquire their shares in Landsec, the Trustee will not be obliged to accept or reject the o/ffer in respect of any shares which are at the time subject to subsisting awards, but will have regard to the interests of the award holders and will have power to consult them to obtain their views on the o/ffer. Subject to the above, the Trustee may take such action with respect to an o/ffer as it thinks /fit.\n\nLandsec is not aware of any agreements or control rights between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The rights, including full details relating to voting of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer relating to Landsec's ordinary shares, are set out in the Articles and in the explanatory notes that accompany the Notice of the 2022 AGM. These documents are available on Landsec's website at: landsec.com/agm.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take e/ffect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover. None of these are considered signi/ficant. The Company's share plans contain provisions that take e/ffect in such an event but do not entitle participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than created by the initial grant or award under the relevant plan. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of o/ffice or employment or otherwise that occurs speci/fically because of a takeover.",

We support the principles set out within both the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Policy is built on these foundations including, without limitation, the principles of equal opportunities, collective bargaining, freedom of association and protection from forced or child labour.\n\nThe Policy takes account of the Modern Slavery Act that came into force in October 2015 and requires Landsec to report annually on its workforce and supply chain, speci/fically to con/firm that workers are not enslaved or tra/fficked. Landsec's latest Modern Slavery Statement was approved by the Board on 30 September 2021 and posted on our website the same day.\n\nLandsec is an equal opportunities employer and our range of employment policies and guidelines re/flects legal and employment requirements in the UK and safeguards the interests of employees, potential employees and other workers. We do not condone unfair treatment of any kind and o/ffer equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and advancement regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, religious or political beliefs. Landsec recognises that it has clear obligations towards all its employees and the community at large to ensure that people with disabilities are a/fforded equal opportunities to enter employment and progress. Landsec has therefore established procedures designed to provide fair consideration and selection of disabled applicants and to satisfy their training and career development needs. If an employee becomes disabled, wherever possible Landsec takes steps to accommodate the disability by making adjustments to their\n\nexisting employment arrangements, or by redeployment and providing appropriate retraining to enable continued employment in the Group. Further information can be found on pages 38-43.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Company did not make any political donations or expenditure in the year that require disclosure (2021: nil).\n\n## Auditor and disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information that has not been brought to the attention of the Company's auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that such information was provided to the auditor.\n\nA resolution to con/firm the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the Company will be proposed at the 2022 AGM. The reappointment has been recommended to the Board by the Audit Committee and EY has indicated its willingness to remain in o/ffice.\n\n## 2022 Annual General Meeting\n\nThis year's AGM is scheduled to be held at 10.00 am on Thursday, 7 July 2022 at 80 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL. We will once again hold this meeting as a hybrid meeting with shareholders having the option to attend the meeting virtually where attendees will be able to watch presentations from our Chairman and CEO. Questions can be raised verbally by those attending the AGM in person, submitted in writing via the messaging function on Lumi's online meeting platform, or verbally via the Virtual Mic.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the /financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the /financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the /financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u2192 We assessed the risk around going concern in planning our audit, at the interim and again at the year-end phase.\n- \u2192 We assessed the appropriateness of the process followed by Management to prepare the Group's going concern assessment, including assessing the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and /financial pressures on tenants leading to a continued credit risk, the impact of acquisitions made by the Group including any facilities acquired and climate change considerations.\n- \u2192 We checked the logic and arithmetical accuracy of the models developed by Management for the base case cash/flow and liquidity forecasts and covenant calculations covering the going concern review period to 30 September 2023 and the additional downside scenarios.\n- \u2192 For each of the modelled scenarios, we challenged the key assumptions used by Management by comparing to corroborative evidence and searching out independent contradictory evidence. We assessed Management's consideration of downside sensitivity analysis taking into account current events and market conditions and historic performance of the Group. We also applied further sensitivities on income and expense cash/flows where appropriate to stress test the impact on liquidity.",

We performed reverse stress testing on key assumptions and considered the likelihood of outcomes including controllable mitigating actions over and above the scenarios modelled. In doing so, we considered the perspective of our Chartered Surveyors.\n- \u2192 We reviewed the disclosures in the /financial statements relating to going concern with a view to con/firming that they appropriately disclose the risk, the impact on the Group's operations and results and potential mitigating actions.\n\nThe results of the severe downside scenarios modelled by Management indicate that the Group would maintain available facility and covenant headroom to be able to withstand the impact of plausible downside sensitivities throughout the period of the going concern assessment to 30 September 2023.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, the Group has a cash balance of \u00a3159m (which includes \u00a331m in relation to the Group's share of cash held within jointly controlled operations). In addition, the Group also has substantial available facilities of \u00a33,022m at 31 March 2022. This includes facilities of \u00a326m expiring during the going concern period.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/fied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern through the going concern period to 30 September 2023.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n- Audit scope \u2192 The Group solely operates in the United Kingdom through four segments: Central London, Major retail, Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods and Subscale sectors.\n- \u2192 During the year, the Group acquired U and I Group PLC ('U+I') which has been identi/fied as a separate component for the purpose of scoping the audit. U+I accounted for 1% of absolute Pro/fit before tax, 0.5% of Revenue and 3% of Total assets. U+I has been designated as a speci/fic scope component with the audit work being performed by the Group audit team.\n- \u2192 The Group audit team also performed direct audit procedures on joint venture balances included within the Group /financial statements.\n- \u2192 The valuation of property, including investment properties and investment properties held in joint ventures.\n- \u2192 Revenue recognition, including the timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of lease incentives.\n- \u2192 (New in 2022) Accounting for the acquisition of U and I Group PLC.\n- \u2192 Overall Group materiality of \u00a3110m which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Group balance sheet at 31 March 2022. Overall materiality is applied to account balances related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) and related loans and borrowings.\n- \u2192 Speci/fic materiality of \u00a318m, which represents 5% of EPRA Earnings before tax. Speci/fic materiality is applied to account balances not related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) and loans and borrowing.\n- \u2192 Parent Company materiality of \u00a356m, which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Parent Company balance sheet. Parent Company materiality is applied to all balances within the Parent Company.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nMateriality",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n134\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report\n\ncontinued\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Parent Company and Group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for the Group. This enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements. We take into account size, risk pro/file, the organisation of the group and e/ffectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed.\n\nU+I has been identi/fied as a separate component for the purpose of scoping the audit and designated a speci/fic scope which is a change from the prior year. Speci/fic scope involves a focus on balances that are considered material to the Group. U+I accounted for 1% of the Group's absolute Pro/fit before tax, 0.5% of Revenue and 3% of Total assets. The audit scope of this component may not have included testing of all signi/ficant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of signi/ficant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nThe components we performed audit procedures on accounted for 100% of the Group's pro/fit before tax, Revenue and Total assets.\n\nAll audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact the Group. The Group has determined that the most signi/ficant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be to deliver on their commitment to be a net zero business by 2030, with the UK government's minimum energy and e/fficiency standards requiring an EPC rating of 'B' by 2030. Management has currently estimated the cost of meeting this commitment to be \u00a3135m. This is explained on pages 66-69 in the required Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures in the Principal risks and uncertainties section of the Strategic Report, which form part of the 'Other information', rather than the audited /financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in Note 2 of the /financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change on the /financial statements, taking into account the relevant disclosures in the Strategic Report. However, governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently /financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash /flows under the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nOur audit e/ffort in considering climate change was focused on the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in the /financial statements and their conclusion that no issues were identi/fied that would materially impact the valuation of the investment properties, investment properties held in joint ventures and trading properties or have any other material impact on the /financial statements. We also challenged the Directors' consideration of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period and include the most signi/ficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identi/fied. These matters included those which had the greatest e/ffect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the e/fforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis year we have included a new key audit matter: Accounting for the acquisition of U and I Group PLC (U+I). The audit partner and other senior members of the audit team spent a signi/ficant amount of time assessing the judgments made and the appropriateness of the balances recorded, due to the complexity of the accounting treatment and the level of judgements and estimates Management made.\n\nIn the prior year, we included a key audit matter: impairment of trade receivables, including lease incentive balances. As a result of the improved cash collections and the ease of restrictions in relation to Covid-19, we have not considered this as a key audit matter in the current year.",

We determined that an asset-based measure would be the most appropriate basis for determining overall materiality given that key users of the Group's /financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the Group's assets. Based on this, we determined that it is appropriate to set the overall materiality at 0.9% of total assets (2021: 0.9% of total assets). We applied overall materiality to the investment property and trading property balances, including those in joint ventures, and other directly related balance sheet items such as the value of loans and borrowings which are secured against the Group's investment properties.\n\nThis provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.\n\nWe determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) or loans and borrowings, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the /financial statements as a whole could in/fluence the economic decisions of users. We believe that it is most appropriate to use a pro/fit-based measure as pro/fit is also a focus of users of the /financial statements.\n\nWe determined that materiality for these areas should be based upon 5% of EPRA earnings before tax. EPRA earnings is considered an important performance metric and aligned with industry earnings measures. In the prior year we used an average of the Group's 2021 and 2020 EPRA earnings before tax. For the 2021 audit, we concluded that the speci/fic materiality was more appropriately determined using a normalised basis based on past results and that better re/flected a normalised level of earnings. This was due to the decline in ERPA earnings because of the impact of Covid-19 and the bad debt charges. This is no longer relevant for the current year audit.\n\nWe reassessed initial materiality at the year-end date which has not resulted in a change from our planning materiality.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of the respective materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.\n\nAudit work at U+I for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over signi/ficant /financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for U+I is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, our performance materiality allocated to U+I was \u00a32.6m.",

We also agreed to report di/fferences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, including the Strategic Report and Governance section set out on pages 1-130, other than the /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the /financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the /financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u2192 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the /financial year for which the /financial statements are prepared is consistent with the /financial statements; and\n- \u2192 the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identi/fied material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors' Report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u2192 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u2192 the Parent Company /financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u2192 certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration speci/fied by law are not made; or\n- \u2192 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the Directors' Statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code speci/fied for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u2192 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identi/fied; pages 70-71 and 131;\n- \u2192 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 70-71;\n- \u2192 Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 131;\n- \u2192 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 131;",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and Management.\n\n## Our approach was as follows:\n\n- \u2192 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most relevant to the presentation of the Annual Report and Accounts are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), the relevant tax regulations in the United Kingdom, including the UK REIT regulations, the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Health & Safety Regulations and the Bribery Act. There are no signi/ficant industry speci/fic laws or regulations that we considered in determining our approach. We understood how Land Securities Group PLC is complying with those frameworks through enquiry with Management, and by identifying the Group's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We also identi/fied those members of Management who have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for reporting any known instances of non-compliance to those charged with governance. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Board and the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up. Our assessment included the tone from the top and the emphasis on a culture of honest and ethical behaviour.\n- \u2192 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's /financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by reviewing the Company's risk register and enquiry with Management and the Audit Committee during the planning and execution phases of our audit. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identi/fied, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how Management monitors those programmes and controls.\n- \u2192 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved:\n- \u00b7  Enquiry of Management, and when appropriate, those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any non-compliance or potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that could a/ffect the /financial statements;\n- \u00b7  Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;\n- \u00b7  Reading of internal audit reports;\n- \u00b7  Obtaining electronic con/firmations from the Group's banking providers to vouch the existence of cash balances and completeness of loans, borrowings and other treasury positions such as derivatives;\n- \u00b7  Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies, including the FRC and HMRC; and\n- \u00b7  Journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding the business.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the /financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## Section 1 - General\n\nThis section contains a description of the Group's signi/ficant accounting policies that relate to the /financial statements as a whole. A/uni00A0description of accounting policies speci/fic to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the /financial statements.\n\nThis section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have been applied in the year and those not yet adopted, and their actual or expected impact on the reported results of the Group.\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation and consolidation\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese /financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs and IFRICs) and, as regards the Parent Company /financial statements, applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The /financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost convention as modi/fied by the revaluation of investment property, /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling), derivative /financial instruments and pension assets.\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the /financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may di/ffer from those estimates.\n\nLand Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income statement), as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The Merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable pro/fit. Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, the Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by the Group.\n\n## Going concern\n\nWhile the impact of Covid-19 has reduced in the year to 31 March 2022, we are still in a period of recovery and therefore the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022. The Group's going concern assessment considers changes in the Group's principal risks (see pages 70-71) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our /financial performance and continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group's secured debt structure within its /financial covenants, which are described in note 22.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed a cash /flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic assumptions on the Group's operating environment (the 'Viability scenario'). This model re/flects unfavourable macroeconomic conditions, a continuation of di/fficulties experienced collecting rent and service charge from our customers and removes uncommitted acquisitions, disposals and developments. We also assume that we are unable to raise any new /finance over this period.\n\nThe Group's key metrics from the Viability scenario as at the end of the going concern assessment period, which covers the 16 months to 30 September 2023, are shown below alongside the actual position at 31 March 2022.\n\n| Key metrics                   | /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | Viability scenario /three.tf/zero.tf September /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/three.tf   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV            | /three.tf/six.tf./four.tf%                             | /three.tf/eight.tf./nine.tf%                                                     |\n| Adjusted net debt             | /sterling.tf/four.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tfm         | /sterling.tf/four.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/three.tfm                                  |\n| EPRA net tangible assets      | /sterling.tf/seven.tf,/eight.tf/eight.tf/eight.tfm     | /sterling.tf/seven.tf,/two.tf/six.tf/six.tfm                                     |\n| Available /financial headroom | /sterling.tf/one.tf./one.tfbn                          | /sterling.tf/one.tf./two.tfbn                                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n145",

The Directors consider the likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote.\n\nThe Security Group requires earnings of at least \u00a3155m in the year ending 31 March 2023 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the Viability scenario, which would ensure compliance through to the end of the going concern assessment period. Security Group earnings are well above the level required to meet the interest cover covenant. Therefore, the Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security Group earnings over the period ending 30 September 2023 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant.\n\nThe Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received, to determine when our available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, the Group continues to have su/fficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the e/ffective date of acquisition or to the e/ffective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which di/ffer from Group accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation.\n\nWhere instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classi/fied as a /financial liability, called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and movements are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere equity in a subsidiary is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the shareholders of the parent, this is classi/fied as a non-controlling interest. Total comprehensive income or loss and the total equity of the Group are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests according to their respective ownership percentages.\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for by including the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.\n\nIntra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated /financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.",

Signi/ficant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most signi/ficant involve assumptions or estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may di/ffer from these estimates.\n\n## Judgements\n\n- \u2192 Recognising revenue where property management activities are performed by a third party (note 6)\n- \u2192 Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (note 12)\n- \u2192 Accounting for property acquisitions and disposals (note 14)\n- \u2192 Accounting for acquisitions of subsidiaries (note 41)\n\n## Estimates\n\n- \u2192 Valuation of investment and trading properties (note 14)\n- \u2192 Impairment of trade receivables (note 27)\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, taking into account the relevant disclosures in the Strategic Report, including those made in accordance with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosure. These considerations included the limited exposure in terms of our investment properties, as we fully costed and committed to invest \u00a3135m to achieve our science-based net zero target by 2030. On this basis, the Group has concluded that climate change did not have a material impact on the /financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that this is not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's going concern or viability assessment.\n\n## 3. Changes in accounting policies and standards\n\nThe accounting policies used in these /financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual /financial statements, as amended where relevant to re/flect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became e/ffective in the year, none of which have had a signi/ficant impact on the Group or Company's income statement or balance sheet.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet e/ffective for the Group. The application of these new standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's income statement or balance sheet.",

Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these di/fferent forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a312.0bn , is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group's statutory /financial statements, where the Group's interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all /financial measures.\n\nEPRA earnings is the Group's alternative measure of the underlying pre-tax pro/fit of the property rental business. EPRA earnings has replaced revenue pro/fit as the Group's primary measure of underlying performance in the year ended 31 March 2022 to align with industry standard. Adjusted earnings, adjusted basic earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share are also no longer reported. There were no di/fferences between these measures at 31 March 2022 and 2021. EPRA earnings excludes all items of a capital nature, such as valuation movements and pro/fits and losses on the disposal of investment properties, as well as exceptional items. The Group believes that EPRA earnings provides additional understanding of the Group's operational performance to shareholders and other stakeholder groups. A full de/finition of EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. The components of EPRA earnings are presented on a proportionate basis in note 4. EPRA earnings is an alternative performance measure.\n\nOur income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including interest expense), which we refer to as EPRA earnings, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of properties, re/financing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital and other items. Our income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to EPRA earnings and Capital and other items. The total column represents the Group's results presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional information. We believe EPRA earnings provides further understanding of the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.\n\n## 4. Segmental information\n\nThe Group's operations are all in the UK and are managed across four operating segments, being Central London, Major retail destinations (Major retail), Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods (Mixed-use urban) and Subscale sectors.\n\nThe Central London segment includes all assets geographically located within central London. Major retail destinations, which was previously referred to as Regional retail, includes all regional shopping centres and shops outside London and our outlets. The Mixed-use urban segment, which was previously referred to as Urban opportunities, includes those assets where we see the most potential for capital investment. There has been no change to the classi/fication of these segments other than the change of name during the year to 31 March 2022. Subscale sectors mainly includes assets that will not be a focus for capital investment and consists of leisure and hotel assets and retail parks.\n\nManagement has determined the Group's operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker is the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors and the Managing Directors. The information presented to ELT includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, /financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.",

However, Segment net rental income is the lowest level to which the pro/fit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the four segments. The administrative costs, which are predominantly sta/ff costs for centralised functions, are all treated as administrative expenses and are not allocated to individual segments.\n\nThe Group manages its /financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis. Individual joint ventures may have speci/fic /financing arrangements in place. Debt facilities and /finance expenses, including those of joint ventures, are managed centrally and are therefore not attributed to a particular segment. Unallocated income and expenses are items incurred centrally which are not directly attributable to one of the segments.\n\nAll items in the segmental information note are presented on a proportionate basis. A reconciliation from the Group income statement to the information presented in the segmental information note is included in table 82.\n\n| EPRA earnings                                         |

Performance measures\n\nIn the tables below, we present earnings per share and net assets per share attributable to shareholders of the parent, calculated in accordance with IFRS, together with certain measures de/fined by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), which have been included to assist comparison between European property companies. Three of the Group's key /financial performance measures are EPRA earnings per share, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share and total accounting return, which was previously referred to as total business return. There has been no change to the calculation of this measure other than the change of name during the year to 31 March 2022.\n\nEPRA earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of underlying earnings, is the basis for the calculation of EPRA earnings per share. We believe EPRA earnings and EPRA earnings per share provide further insight into the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as they focus on the rental income performance of the business and exclude Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.\n\n| Earnings per share                                          | Year ended  /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | Year ended  /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf   | Year ended  /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | Year ended  /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | Pro/fit for  the year /sterling.tfm                                | EPRA  earnings /sterling.tfm                                       | Loss for  the year /sterling.tfm                                   | EPRA  earnings /sterling.tfm                                       |\n| Pro/fit/(loss) attributable to shareholders of the parent   | /eight.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                           | /eight.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                           | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf)                               | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf)                               |\n| Valuation and pro/fit on disposals                          | -                                                                  | (/five.tf/two.tf/seven.tf)                                         | -                                                                  | /one.tf,/six.tf/four.tf/two.tf                                     |\n| Net /finance (income)/expense (excluded from EPRA earnings) | -                                                                  | (/one.tf)                                                          | -                                                                  | /three.tf                                                          |\n| Exceptional items                                           | -                                                                  | /six.tf                                                            | -                                                                  | /four.tf                                                           |\n| Other                                                       | -                                                                  | /eight.tf                                                          | -                                                                  | (/five.tf)                                                         |\n| Pro/fit/(loss) used in per share calculation                | /eight.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                                           | /three.tf/five.tf/five.tf                                          | (/one.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/three.tf)                               | /two.tf/five.tf/one.tf                                             |\n|                                                             | IFRS                                                               | EPRA                                                               | IFRS                                                               | EPRA                                                               |\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per share                             | /one.tf/one.tf/seven.tf./four.tfp                                  | /four.tf/eight.tf./zero.tfp                                        | (/one.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf./two.tf)p                               | /three.tf/three.tf./nine.tfp                                       |\n| Diluted earnings/(loss) per share /one.tf                   | /one.tf/one.tf/seven.tf./one.tfp                                   | /four.tf/seven.tf./eight.tfp                                       | (/one.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf./two.tf)p                               | /three.tf/three.tf./nine.tfp                                       |\n\n- /one.tf.

Revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccounting policy\n\nRental income, including /fixed rental uplifts, is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease incentives being o/ffered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to /fit out or similar costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis. Where the total consideration due under a lease is modi/fied, for example, where a concession is granted to a tenant prior to the date the conceded rent falls due, the revised total amount due under the lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\n\nContingent rents, being lease payments that are not /fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are variable consideration and are recorded as income in the year in which they are earned. Where a single payment is received from a tenant to cover both rent and service charge, the service charge component is separated and reported as service charge income.\n\nThe Group's revenue from contracts with customers, as de/fined in IFRS 15, includes service charge income, other property related income, trading property sales proceeds and long-term development contract income.\n\nService charge income and management fees are recorded as income over time in the year in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised over time because the tenants bene/fit from the services as soon as they are rendered by the Group. The actual service provided during each reporting period is determined using cost incurred as the input method.\n\nOther property related income includes development and asset management fees. These fees are recognised over time, using time elapsed as the input method which measures the bene/fit simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, over the period the development or asset management services are provided.\n\nProceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when control of the property transfers to the buyer, i.e. the buyer has the ability to direct the use of the property and the right to the cash in/flows and out/flows generated by it. This generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion. If completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange or if the Group has signi/ficant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion, the Group assesses whether there are multiple performance obligations in the contract and recognises revenue as each performance obligation is satis/fied.\n\nWhen property is let under a /finance lease, the Group recognises a receivable equal to the net investment in the lease at inception of the lease. Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and /finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the /finance lease and is recognised within revenue.",

Progress towards completion of the development, by reference to the value of work completed using the costs incurred to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract is used as the input method.\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting judgement\n\nFor those properties where the property management activities are performed by a third party, the Group considers the third party to be the principal delivering the service. The key factors considered by the Group when making this judgement include the following responsibilities of the third party:\n\n- \u2192 selecting suppliers and ensuring all services are delivered\n- \u2192 establishing prices and seeking e/fficiencies\n- \u2192 risk management and compliance\n\nIn addition, the residual rights residing with the Group are generally protective in nature.\n\nAll revenue is classi/fied within the 'EPRA earnings' column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds from the sale of trading properties, income from long-term development contracts and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                           | EPRA  earnings /sterling.tfm   | Capital  and other  items /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Total /sterling.tfm   | EPRA  earnings /sterling.tfm   | Capital  and other  items /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Total /sterling.tfm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Rental income (excluding adjustment for lease incentives) | /five.tf/five.tf/two.tf        | /three.tf /one.tf                         | /five.tf/five.tf/five.tf                            | /five.tf/four.tf/eight.tf      | -                                         | /five.tf/four.tf/eight.tf                           |\n| Adjustment for lease incentives                           | (/one.tf/eight.tf)             | -                                         | (/one.tf/eight.tf)                                  | (/two.tf/nine.tf)              | -                                         | (/two.tf/nine.tf)                                   |\n| Rental income                                             | /five.tf/three.tf/four.tf      | /three.tf                                 | /five.tf/three.tf/seven.tf                          | /five.tf/one.tf/nine.tf        | -                                         | /five.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                             |\n| Service charge income                                     | /seven.tf/seven.tf             | /one.tf /one.tf                           | /seven.tf/eight.tf                                  | /seven.tf/zero.tf              | -                                         | /seven.tf/zero.tf                                   |\n| Trading property sales proceeds                           | -                              | /two.tf/seven.tf                          | /two.tf/seven.tf                                    | -                              | -                                         | -                                                   |\n| Other property related income                             | /two.tf/five.tf                | -                                         | /two.tf/five.tf                                     | /three.tf/one.tf               | -                                         | /three.tf/one.tf                                    |\n| Finance lease interest                                    | /eight.tf                      | -                                         | /eight.tf                                           | /nine.tf                       | -                                         | /nine.tf                                            |\n| Long-term development contract income                     | -                              | /one.tf                                   | /one.tf                                             | -                              | -                                         | -                                                   |\n| Gain on settlement of liability                           | -                              | -                                         | -                                                   | -                              | /four.tf                                  | /four.tf                                            |\n| Other income                                              | /three.tf                      | -                                         | /three.tf                                           | /two.tf                        | -                                         | /two.tf                                             |\n| Revenue per the income statement                          | /six.tf/four.tf/seven.tf       | /three.tf/two.tf                          | /six.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf                            | /six.tf/three.tf/one.tf        | /four.tf                                  | /six.tf/three.tf/five.tf                            |\n\n- /one.tf.

Costs\n\nAccounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-/financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash /flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nRents payable re/flect amounts due under head leases. Where rents payable are variable, and do not depend on an index or rate, the payments are recognised in the income statement as incurred.

Dividends continued\n\nThe third quarterly interim dividend of 8.5p per ordinary share, or \u00a363m in total (2021: 6.0p or \u00a344m in total), was paid on 7 April 2022 as a Property Income Distribution (PID). The Board has recommended a /final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2022 of 13.0p per ordinary share (2021: 9.0p) to be paid as a PID. This /final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of \u00a396m (2021: actual distribution of \u00a366m). Subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting, the /final dividend will be paid on 22 July 2022 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 17 June 2022.\n\nThe total dividend paid and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022 is 37.0p per ordinary share (2021: 27.0p) resulting in a total estimated distribution of \u00a3274m (2021: actual distribution of \u00a3199m).\n\nThe /first quarterly dividend for the year ending 31 March 2023 will be paid in October 2022 and will be announced in due course.\n\nA Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year. The last day for DRIP elections for the /final dividend is close of business on 1 July 2022.\n\n## 12. Income tax\n\nAccounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncome tax on the pro/fit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled.\n\nNo provision is made for temporary di/fferences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting judgement\n\nThe Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its pro/fits and gains from the qualifying rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying pro/fits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:\n\n- \u2192 at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group's assets;\n- \u2192 at least 75% of the Group's total pro/fits must arise from the tax exempt business; and\n- \u2192 at least 90% of the notional taxable pro/fit of the property rental business must be distributed.\n\nThe Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary di/fferences relating to the property rental business.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believe they will be recovered against future taxable pro/fits.\n\nThere is no income tax charge in the income statement. In the year ended 31 March 2021, there was no income tax charge in the income statement. There is a deferred tax charge of \u00a35m (2021: \u00a32m credit) included within Other comprehensive income.",

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group's IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest are presented as either 'Investment properties' or 'Trading properties'. The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Group's share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within 'Investments in joint ventures'.\n\nInternally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a312.0bn , is an example of this proportionate share, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further insight to stakeholders about the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Both of these values are determined by the Group's external valuers. The combined value of the Group's total investment property portfolio (including the Group's share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. The di/fference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or de/ficit. Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.\n\nSome of the Group's investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of the lease and accounted for as investment property. Initially, the cost of investment properties held under leases includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The investment properties held under leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. A corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the liability and a /finance charge to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding liability.\n\n## Trading properties\n\nTrading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are presented on the balance sheet within current assets.\n\n## Acquisition of properties\n\nProperties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes control of the property.\n\n## Capital expenditure and capitalisation of borrowing costs\n\nCapital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised. The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group's weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal sta/ff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised. The total sta/ff and associated costs are capitalised based on the proportion of time spent on the relevant scheme. Internal sta/ff costs are capitalised from the date the Group determines it is probable that the development will progress until the date of practical completion.",

When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement. The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.\n\n## Disposal of properties\n\nProperties are treated as disposed when control of the property is transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on unconditional exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have signi/ficant outstanding obligations after exchange, the control will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion.\n\nThe pro/fit on disposal is determined as the di/fference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The pro/fit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSigni/ficant accounting judgement\n\n## Acquisition and disposal of properties\n\nProperty transactions can be complex in nature and material to the /financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be recognised, management consider whether the Group assumes or relinquishes control of the property, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished. Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must be satis/fied before the contract is ful/filled. In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSigni/ficant accounting estimate\n\n## Valuation of the Group's properties\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental revenues from that particular property. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction /flow in the property market.\n\nThe investment property valuation contains a number of assumptions upon which the Group's valuer has based its valuation of the Group's properties. The assumptions on which the property valuation reports have been based include, but are not limited to, matters such as the tenure and tenancy details for the properties, ground conditions at the properties, the structural condition of the properties, prevailing market yields and comparable market transactions. These assumptions are market standard and accord with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation - Professional Standards UK.\n\nThe estimation of the net realisable value of the Group's trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to signi/ficant variation. As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group's trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIf the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of the Group's investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an e/ffect on the Group's /financial position and results.\n\nThe Valuer's report for the year ended 31 March 2021 contained a 'material uncertainty' clause in relation to the valuation of hotels due to the disruption to the market at that date caused by Covid-19. As hotels only form a small portion of the Group's portfolio, the range of sensitivities disclosed in the tables on pages 165-166 have been deemed to provide su/fficient information on the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations. The Valuers' reports for the year ended 31 March 2022 did not contain a material uncertainty clause.",

This represents the /two.tf/five.tf% interest in MediaCity which is not owned by the Group, but which is consolidated in the Group numbers.\n\nThe net book value of leasehold properties where head leases have been capitalised is \u00a32,908m (2021: \u00a32,484m).\n\nInvestment properties include capitalised interest of \u00a3249m (2021: \u00a3232m). The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 2.5% (2021: 2.6%). The gross historical cost of investment properties is \u00a38,604m (2021: \u00a37,554m).\n\n## Valuation process\n\nThe fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2022, except those in the MediaCity portfolio and part of the portfolio acquired as part of U+I Group PLC, was determined by the Group's external valuer, CBRE. The MediaCity portfolio was valued by Savills and the part of the U+I Group PLC portfolio not valued by CBRE was valued by JLL at 31 March 2022. The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations performed by the valuers are reviewed internally by Senior Management and other relevant people within the business. This process includes discussions of the assumptions used by the valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuers on a half-yearly basis.\n\nThe valuers' opinion of fair value was primarily derived using comparable recent market transactions on arm's length terms and using appropriate valuation techniques. The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. Under this approach, forecast net cash /flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers' opinion of fair value. The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash /flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.",

Investment properties continued\n\nProperties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method. Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including /finance and developer's pro/fit, to arrive at the valuation. Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development (excluding /finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants. As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.\n\nThe Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within 'Level 3', as de/fined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 26(iii).

Joint arrangements\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group's share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the /financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nThe Group's principal joint arrangements are described below:\n\n| Joint ventures /one.tf                                       | Percentage owned  & voting rights /two.tf   | Business segment                |

Investments in associates\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAssociates are those entities over whose /financial and operating policy decisions the Group has signi/ficant in/fluence, established by contractual agreement, but over which the Group does not have control or joint control over those policies. Interests in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method requires the Group's share of the associate's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the associate's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group's principal interests in associates, acquired as part of the purchase of the share capital of U+I Group PLC on 14 December 2021 and held at 31 March 2022, are described below:\n\n| Associates /one.tf                         | Percentage owned and voting rights   | Year end date             | Business segment   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| CDSR Burlington House Developments Limited | /two.tf/zero.tf%                     | /three.tf/one.tf December | Subscale sectors   |\n| Northpoint Developments Limited            | /four.tf/two.tf%                     | /three.tf/one.tf December | Subscale sectors   |\n| YC Shepherds Bush Limited                  | /two.tf/four.tf . /five.tf %         | /three.tf/one.tf December | Subscale sectors   |\n\n- /one.tf.

Net investment in /finance leases\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nWhere the Group's leases transfer the signi/ficant risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the tenant, the lease is accounted for as a /finance lease. At the outset of the lease the fair value of the asset is de-recognised from investment property and recognised as a /finance lease receivable. Lease income is recognised over the period of the lease, re/flecting a constant rate of return. The di/fference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as /finance income within Revenue over the lease term.\n\n|                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Non-current                                 |                                                |                                               |\n| Finance leases - gross receivables          | /eight.tf/two.tf                               | /two.tf/two.tf/five.tf                        |\n| Unguaranteed residual value                 | /two.tf/eight.tf                               | /three.tf/four.tf                             |\n| Unearned /finance income                    | (/four.tf/zero.tf)                             | (/one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf)                    |\n|                                             | /seven.tf/zero.tf                              | /one.tf/five.tf/two.tf                        |\n| Current                                     |                                                |                                               |\n| Finance leases - gross receivables          | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| Unearned /finance income                    | (/four.tf)                                     | (/nine.tf)                                    |\n|                                             | /two.tf                                        | /four.tf                                      |\n| Net investment in /finance leases           | /seven.tf/two.tf                               | /one.tf/five.tf/six.tf                        |\n| Gross receivables from /finance leases due: |                                                |                                               |\n| No later than one year                      | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| One to two years                            | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| Two to three years                          | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| Three to four years                         | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| Four to /five years                         | /six.tf                                        | /one.tf/three.tf                              |\n| More than /five years                       | /five.tf/eight.tf                              | /one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf                     |\n|                                             | /eight.tf/eight.tf                             | /two.tf/three.tf/eight.tf                     |\n| Unguaranteed residual value                 | /two.tf/eight.tf                               | /three.tf/four.tf                             |\n| Unearned /finance income                    | (/four.tf/four.tf)                             | (/one.tf/one.tf/six.tf)                       |\n| Net investment in /finance leases           | /seven.tf/two.tf                               | /one.tf/five.tf/six.tf                        |\n\nThe Group has leased out several investment properties under /finance leases, which range from 20 to 40 years in duration from the inception of the lease.

Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets arising on business combinations and software used internally within the business. Intangible assets arising on business combinations are initially recognised at fair value. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment. Other intangible assets arising on business combinations are amortised to the income statement over their expected useful lives. Software assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, normally three to /five years.\n\n|                                                         | Goodwill  /sterling.tfm   | Software  /sterling.tfm   | Other  intangible   asset /sterling.tfm   | Total  /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| At /one.tf April /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf         | /one.tf                   | /six.tf                   | /seven.tf                                 | /one.tf/four.tf        |\n| Capital expenditure                                     | -                         | /two.tf                   | -                                         | /two.tf                |\n| Amortisation                                            | -                         | (/three.tf)               | (/one.tf)                                 | (/four.tf)             |\n| Impairment                                              | -                         | -                         | (/four.tf)                                | (/four.tf)             |\n| At /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf | /one.tf                   | /five.tf                  | /two.tf                                   | /eight.tf              |\n| Capital expenditure                                     | -                         | /two.tf                   | -                                         | /two.tf                |\n| Additions                                               | /six.tf                   | -                         | -                                         | /six.tf                |\n| Amortisation                                            | -                         | (/two.tf)                 | -                                         | (/two.tf)              |\n| Impairment                                              | (/six.tf)                 | -                         | -                                         | (/six.tf)              |\n| At /three.tf/one.tf March /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf | /one.tf                   | /five.tf                  | /two.tf                                   | /eight.tf              |\n\nThe other intangible asset relates to the Group's acquisition of its interest in Bluewater, Kent in 2014 and represents the estimated fair value of the management rights for the centre. The fair value at the date of acquisition was \u00a330m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years. On recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of \u00a36m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount. The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised or impaired, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is being tested for impairment.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2022, the intangible asset has been impaired by \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a34m). The recoverable amount of the intangible asset has been based on its value in use, using a discount rate of 4.0% (2021: 4.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n173",

The Group's strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing /financial and operating market cycles. The table in note 21 details a number of the Group's key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.\n\nA key element of the Group's capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets (the Security Group). This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term /flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates. In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable /flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate /finance for each speci/fic asset or joint venture.\n\n## 21.

Borrowings\n\nAccounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBorrowings, other than bank overdrafts, are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nWhen debt re/financing exercises are carried out, existing liabilities will be treated as being extinguished when the new liability is substantially di/fferent from the existing liability. In making this assessment, the Group will consider the transaction as a whole, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative characteristics.\n\n|

The Security Group includes investment properties, development properties, the X-Leisure fund, and the Group's investment in Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova, Victoria, St. David's Limited Partnership and Southside Limited Partnership, in total valued at \u00a311.2bn at 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: \u00a310.6bn). The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial /flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45x respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate of each MTN is /fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date of the MTN. The interest rate for the last two years may either become /floating on a SONIA basis plus an increased margin (relative to that at the time of issue), or subject to a /fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the speci/fic notes.\n\nThe e/ffective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.\n\nDuring the year, the Group purchased \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a312m) of MTNs for a total premium of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a33m).

Holding cash in restricted accounts does not prevent the Group from optimising returns by putting these monies on short-term deposit.\n\n|                          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand | /one.tf/zero.tf                               | /three.tf                                            | /two.tf                                        | /three.tf                                              |\n| Short-term deposits      | /one.tf/two.tf                                | /seven.tf                                            | -                                              | -                                                      |\n|                          | /two.tf/two.tf                                | /one.tf/zero.tf                                      | /two.tf                                        | /three.tf                                              |\n\nThe credit quality of monies held in restricted accounts and deposits can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings of the counterparty where the account or deposit is placed.\n\n|                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Counterparties with external credit ratings |                                               |                                                      |                                                |                                                        |\n| A/plus.tf                                   | /one.tf/six.tf                                | /seven.tf                                            | -                                              | -                                                      |\n| A                                           | /five.tf                                      | /two.tf                                              | /one.tf                                        | /two.tf                                                |\n| A-                                          | /one.tf                                       | -                                                    | /one.tf                                        | -                                                      |\n| BBB/plus.tf                                 | -                                             | /one.tf                                              | -                                              | /one.tf                                                |\n|                                             | /two.tf/two.tf                                | /one.tf/zero.tf                                      | /two.tf                                        | /three.tf                                              |",

Derivative /financial instruments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group uses interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps and forwards to manage its market risk. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes.\n\nAll derivatives are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or market quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash /flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date. The gain or loss on derivatives are recognised immediately in the income statement, within net /finance expense.\n\n| Carrying value of derivative /financial instruments   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Current assets                                        | /five.tf                                      | /one.tf                                       |\n| Non-current assets                                    | /two.tf/one.tf                                | /three.tf                                     |\n| Current liabilities                                   | -                                             | (/seven.tf)                                   |\n| Non-current liabilities                               | -                                             | -                                             |\n|                                                       | /two.tf/six.tf                                | (/three.tf)                                   |",

Financial risk management\n\n## Introduction\n\nA review of the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in Managing risk and Our principal risks and uncertainties (pages 58-69). This note provides further detail on /financial risk management and includes quantitative information on speci/fic /financial risks.\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of /financial risks: market risks (principally interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse e/ffects of these on the Group's /financial performance and includes the use of derivative /financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors, except where the relevant arrangements have been put in place by an individual subsidiary or a joint venture level prior to acquisition.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it intends to hold its /financial assets to collect the contractual cash /flows, or whether it intends to sell them before maturity and classi/fies its /financial instruments into the appropriate categories. The following table summarises the Group's /financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:\n\n|                                                                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | Group /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /sterling.tfm   | Company /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                                                    | /five.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf                    | /six.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                             | /two.tf                                        | /three.tf                                              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                             | /one.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                       | -                                                    | -                                              | -                                                      |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling) | -                                             | /five.tf                                             | -                                              | -                                                      |\n| Financial liabilities at amortised cost                                               | (/four.tf,/seven.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf)        | (/three.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/six.tf)                  | (/two.tf,/nine.tf/one.tf/two.tf)               | (/two.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/zero.tf)                     |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss                           | /two.tf/six.tf                                | (/three.tf)                                          | -                                              | -                                                      |\n|                                                                                       | (/four.tf,/zero.tf/three.tf/five.tf)          | (/three.tf,/zero.tf/two.tf/seven.tf)                 | (/two.tf,/nine.tf/one.tf/zero.tf)              | (/two.tf,/six.tf/two.tf/seven.tf)                      |\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nThe Group's principal /financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, net investment in /finance leases and amounts due from joint ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that speci/fically relates to each type of asset.\n\n## Bank and /financial institutions\n\nThe principal credit risks of the Group arise from /financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and /financial institutions. In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and /financial institutions with a minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and /financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group's treasury function currently performs regular reviews of the credit ratings of all /financial institution counterparties. Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single /financial institution remain within the Group's policy limits.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements, likely deferrals of payments due, agreed rent concessions and market expectations and trends in the wider macroeconomic environment in which our customers operate. These assessments are made on a customer by customer basis.\n\nTo limit the Group's exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, a credit report is usually obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty. This report, alongside the Group's internal assessment of credit risk, is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception. In general, these deposits represent between three and six months' rent.\n\n## Net investment in /finance leases\n\nThis balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant /finance leases. This is not considered a signi/ficant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good /financial standing.\n\n## (ii) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with /final maturities between 2025 and 2059, commercial paper and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has su/fficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.\n\nManagement monitors the Group's available funds as follows:\n\n|                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents             | /one.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                        | -                                              |\n| Commercial paper                      | (/four.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf)                     | (/nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf)                      |\n| Undrawn facilities                    | /one.tf,/four.tf/six.tf/two.tf                 | /two.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                |\n| Cash and available undrawn facilities | /one.tf,/zero.tf/nine.tf/one.tf                | /one.tf,/six.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                |\n| As a proportion of drawn debt /one.tf | /two.tf/four.tf./six.tf%                       | /four.tf/six.tf./one.tf%                       |\n\n- /one.tf. Based on nominal values.\n\nThe Group's core /financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.\n\n## Security Group\n\nThe Group's principal /financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that comprises the majority of the Group's investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures. These arrangements operate in 'tiers' determined by LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR). This structure is most /flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive. No /financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 36.4% (2021: 32.7%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and bene/fited from maximum operational /flexibility.\n\nManagement monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.\n\n## Non-restricted Group\n\nThe Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.",

Due to a combination of factors, including the degree of certainty required under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the Group does not apply hedge accounting to hedging instruments used in this context. Speci/fic interest-rate hedges are also used from time to time to /fix the interest rate exposure on our debt. Where speci/fic hedges are used to /fix the interest exposure on /floating rate debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group (including the Group's share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) had pay-/fixed interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of \u00a3619m (2021: \u00a3400m) and forward starting pay-/fixed interest-rate swaps of \u00a3275m (2021: \u00a3275m). The Group's net debt was 70.0% /fixed (2021: 80.8%) and based on the Group's debt balances at 31 March 2022, a 1% increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) the annual net /finance expense in the income statement and reduce/(increase) equity by \u00a39m (2021: \u00a37m). The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nForeign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Group's functional currency.\n\nAs it is UK based, the Group's foreign exchange risk is low. The vast majority of the Group's foreign currency transactions relate to foreign currency borrowing under the Group's commercial paper programme. It is the Group's policy to hedge 100% of this exposure. At 31 March 2022, the Group had issued \u20ac255m (2021: \u20ac752m) and $185m (2021: $250m) of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil) impact in the income statement and equity arising from foreign currency borrowings.\n\nWhere additional foreign exchange risk is identi/fied (not linked to commercial paper borrowing), it is the Group's policy to assess the likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk. At 31 March 2022, the Group had \u20ac6m (2021: \u20ac17m) of foreign currency exposures being managed using foreign currency derivative contracts. These were entered into in order to economically hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currencies. A 10% weakening of Sterling would increase the pro/fit before tax and increase total equity by \u00a31m (2021: \u00a32m). A 10% strengthening in Sterling would decrease the pro/fit before tax and reduce equity by \u00a31m (2021: \u00a31m).\n\n## Financial maturity analysis\n\nThe interest rate pro/file of the Group's borrowings is set out below (based on notional values):\n\n|           |                                   |                                   |                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf      |\n|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|           | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm        | Floating   rate  /sterling.tfm    | Total  /sterling.tfm              | Fixed   rate  /sterling.tfm      | Floating   rate  /sterling.tfm  | Total  /sterling.tfm               |\n| Sterling  | /two.tf,/four.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf,/seven.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /four.tf,/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /two.tf/nine.tf/three.tf        | /two.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/zero.tf   |\n| Euro      | /three.tf/zero.tf                 | /two.tf/one.tf/seven.tf           | /two.tf/four.tf/seven.tf          | -                                | /six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf         | /six.tf/four.tf/zero.tf            |\n| US Dollar | -                                 | /one.tf/four.tf/two.tf            | /one.tf/four.tf/two.tf            | -                                | /one.tf/eight.tf/two.tf         | /one.tf/eight.tf/two.tf            |\n|           | /two.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf  | /two.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/nine.tf  | /four.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/five.tf  | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf |\n\nThe expected maturity pro/files of the Group's borrowings are as follows (based on notional values):\n\n|                                                   | Fixed   rate /sterling.tfm       | Floating   rate  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Total  /sterling.tfm   | Fixed   rate  /sterling.tfm       | Floating   rate  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Total  /sterling.tfm   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| One year or less, or on demand                    | /three.tf/zero.tf                | /five.tf/one.tf/one.tf           | /five.tf/four.tf/one.tf                              | -                                 | /nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf          | /nine.tf/zero.tf/six.tf                              |\n| More than one year but not more than two years    | /four.tf/two.tf/seven.tf         | /two.tf                          | /four.tf/two.tf/nine.tf                              | -                                 | -                                | -                                                    |\n| More than two years but not more than /five years | /four.tf/three.tf/seven.tf       | /one.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/six.tf  | /one.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/three.tf                   | /five.tf/one.tf/four.tf           | /two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf          | /seven.tf/two.tf/three.tf                            |\n| More than /five years                             | /one.tf,/six.tf/one.tf/five.tf   | -                                | /one.tf,/six.tf/one.tf/five.tf                       | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf | -                                | /one.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf                    |\n| Borrowings                                        | /two.tf,/five.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf | /two.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/nine.tf | /four.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/eight.tf                    | /two.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf  | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/five.tf   | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                   |\n| E/ffect of hedging                                | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf         | (/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)       | -                                                    | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf          | (/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)       | -                                                    |\n| Borrowings net of interest-rate swaps             | /two.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf,/six.tf/five.tf/nine.tf  | /four.tf,/five.tf/six.tf/eight.tf                    | /two.tf,/eight.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /seven.tf/one.tf/five.tf         | /three.tf,/five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                   |",

Trade and other receivables\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, subsequently at amortised cost and, where relevant, adjusted for the time value of money. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.\n\nIn determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements and market expectations and trends in the wider macroeconomic environment in which our customers operate. Where a concession is agreed with a customer after the due date for the rent, this amount is recognised as an impairment of the related trade receivable.\n\nTrade and other receivables are written o/ff once all avenues to recover the balances are exhausted and the lease has ended. Receivables written o/ff are no longer subject to any enforcement activity.\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting estimate\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables\n\nThe Group's assessment of expected credit losses is inherently subjective due to the forward-looking nature of the assessments. As a result, the value of the provisions for impairment of the Group's trade receivables are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. See note 26 for further details of the Group's assessment of the credit risk associated with trade receivables.\n\n|                                                            | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Net trade receivables                                      | /three.tf/eight.tf                            | /seven.tf/four.tf                             |\n| Tenant lease incentives (note /one.tf/four.tf)             | /two.tf/one.tf/two.tf                         | /two.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                      |\n| Prepayments                                                | /three.tf/four.tf                             | /two.tf/four.tf                               |\n| Accrued income                                             | /one.tf/one.tf                                | /three.tf                                     |\n| Amounts due from joint ventures and associates             | /one.tf/five.tf                               | /seven.tf                                     |\n| Other receivables                                          | /five.tf/eight.tf                             | /one.tf/six.tf                                |\n| Total current trade and other receivables                  | /three.tf/six.tf/eight.tf                     | /three.tf/five.tf/four.tf                     |\n| Non-current amounts due from joint ventures and associates | /one.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                      | /one.tf/six.tf/two.tf                         |\n| Non-current property sales receivables                     | /five.tf                                      | /eight.tf                                     |\n| Deferred consideration                                     | /one.tf/eight.tf                              | -                                             |\n| Other non-current receivables                              | /seven.tf                                     | -                                             |\n| Total trade and other receivables                          | /five.tf/four.tf/five.tf                      | /five.tf/two.tf/four.tf                       |\n\nThe accounting for lease incentives is set out in note 6.

Net pension surplus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nContributions to de/fined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nThe pension obligations arising under the Group's de/fined bene/fit pension scheme are measured at discounted present value. The scheme assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or bene/fit value. The operating and /financing costs of the scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they are identi/fied. Net /financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in /finance income or expense on a net basis. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience di/ffering from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.\n\n## De/fined contribution schemes\n\nThe charge to operating pro/fit for the year in respect of de/fined contribution schemes was \u00a33m (2021: \u00a33m).\n\n## De/fined bene/fit scheme\n\nThe Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered de/fined bene/fit /final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Speci/fic Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Scheme's Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the bene/ficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation (including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.",

Net pension surplus continued\n\nIn setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a quali/fied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The Scheme is closed to new members (and was closed to future accrual on 31 October 2019). A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2021 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP. This valuation was updated to 31 March 2022 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2024.\n\nThere have been no employer or employee contributions following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual on 31 October 2019. Prior to this, the employer contribution rate was 43.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing bene/fits and the employee contributions were at 8% of monthly pensionable salary. It was also agreed that no further de/ficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee contributions were paid by salary sacri/fice, and therefore appeared as Group contributions. The Group does not expect to make any employee or employer contributions to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2023 (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\nAll death-in-service and incapacity bene/fits arising during employment are wholly insured. No post-retirement bene/fits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.\n\n| Analysis of the amounts charged to the income statement                     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf /sterling.tfm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Analysis of the amount charged to operating pro/fit                         |                                               |                                               |\n| Current service costs                                                       | -

The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates di/ffer from those prescribed by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. Using the assumptions agreed with the Trustees would result in a balance sheet surplus for the Scheme of \u00a38m at 31 March 2022, as opposed to a surplus of \u00a328m .\n\nIn order to reduce risk within the Scheme, 40% (2021: 43%) of the Scheme assets are invested in annuities that match the liabilities of some pensioners. The assets that the Scheme holds are designed to match a signi/ficant proportion of the Scheme liabilities and the Scheme has hedged over 90% (2021: 89%) of the interest rate risk and 90% (2021: 88%) of the in/flation risk (when measured on a gilts /flat discount rate) to which it is exposed.\n\nThe Company did not operate any de/fined contribution schemes or de/fined bene/fit schemes during the /financial years ended 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.",

Share-based payments\n\nAccounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cost of granting shares, options over shares and other share-based remuneration to employees and Executive Directors is recognised through the income statement. All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the awards have Total Shareholder Return (TSR) market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the awards. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.\n\nThe following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with the number of options outstanding.\n\n|                               | Charge  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Number  (millions)   | Charge  /sterling.tfm   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Number  (millions)   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan      | /two.tf                 | /two.tf                                            | /two.tf                 | /two.tf                                            |\n| Deferred Share Bonus Plan     | -                       | -                                                  | -                       | -                                                  |\n| Executive Share Option Scheme | -                       | /one.tf                                            | -                       | /one.tf                                            |\n| Sharesave Plan                | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            |\n| Restricted Share Plan         | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            | /one.tf                 | /one.tf                                            |\n|                               | /four.tf                | /five.tf                                           | /four.tf                | /five.tf                                           |\n\nA summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below. The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and Other plans. For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 108-124.\n\n## Executive plans:\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nThe LTIP is open to Executive Directors and Executive Leadership Team members with awards made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The LTIP was reopened to senior management in the current year. In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of 'matching shares' could be made where the individual acquired shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledged to hold them for a period of three years. The awards are issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 752p (2021: 616p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a37m (2021: \u00a33m).\n\n## Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)\n\nThe Executive Directors' annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. The shares are usually deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the EBT at nil consideration. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 703p (2021: 567p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2021: \u00a31m).\n\n## Other plans:\n\n## Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS)\n\nThe 2005 ESOS was previously open to managers not eligible to participate in the LTIP, but was largely replaced by the new Restricted Share Option Plan in the year ended 31 March 2020. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were no awards exercised during the year (2021: none). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Sharesave Plan\n\nUnder the Sharesave Plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three or /five year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation less 20% discount. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 764p (2021: no awards exercised during the year). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2021: \u00a31m).",

It is open to qualifying management level employees with awards granted as nil cost options. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the day immediately preceding date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 787p (2021: no awards exercised during the year). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a32m (2021: \u00a31m).\n\nThe aggregate number of awards outstanding, and the weighted average exercise price, are shown below:\n\n|                                             | Executive plans /one.tf                         | Executive plans /one.tf                          |                                                 |                                                  |                                              |                                              |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                             |                                                 |                                                  |                                                 |                                                  | Other plans Weighted average  exercise price | Other plans Weighted average  exercise price |\n|                                             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Number (millions) | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Number  (millions) | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Number (millions) | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Number  (millions) | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf Pence          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf Pence          |\n| At the beginning of the year                | /two.tf                                         | /two.tf                                          | /two.tf                                         | /two.tf                                          | /eight.tf/two.tf/one.tf                      | /eight.tf/seven.tf/three.tf                  |\n| Granted                                     | /one.tf                                         | /one.tf                                          | -                                               | /one.tf                                          | /six.tf/six.tf/two.tf                        | /five.tf/three.tf/one.tf                     |\n| Exercised                                   | -                                               | -                                                | -                                               | -                                                | /six.tf/three.tf/five.tf                     | -                                            |\n| Lapsed                                      | (/one.tf)                                       | (/one.tf)                                        | -                                               | (/one.tf)                                        | /seven.tf/eight.tf/one.tf                    | /eight.tf/one.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| At /three.tf/one.tf March                   | /two.tf                                         | /two.tf                                          | /two.tf                                         | /two.tf                                          | /eight.tf/zero.tf/five.tf                    | /eight.tf/two.tf/one.tf                      |\n| Exercisable at the end of the year          | -                                               | -                                                | /one.tf                                         | /one.tf                                          | /one.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/seven.tf            | /one.tf,/three.tf/four.tf/three.tf           |\n|                                             | Years                                           | Years                                            | Years                                           | Years                                            |                                              |                                              |\n| Weighted average remaining contractual life | /one.tf                                         | /one.tf                                          | /three.tf                                       | /four.tf                                         |                                              |                                              |\n\n- /one.tf.

Share-based payments continued\n\nExpected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group's share price over the previous ten years. The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon management's best estimate for the e/ffects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.\n\n## Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions\n\nFair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.

Acquisition of subsidiaries\n\nAccounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Note 1 for the Group's policy on recognition of subsidiary undertakings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting judgement\n\nAcquisitions of subsidiaries, and the method applied on the initial recognition of the subsidiary or group of subsidiaries, by nature can be complex and material to the /financial statements. When a subsidiary is acquired, management considers the substance of the assets and activities of the acquired entity to determine whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or an acquisition of an asset. An acquisition is accounted for as a business combination where an integrated set of activities and assets, including property, is acquired. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which is measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business combination, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their relative fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.\n\n## Business acquisition\n\nThe Group has accounted for the purchase of 100% of the share capital of U+I Group PLC for a cash consideration of \u00a3191m on 14 December 2021 in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The Group incurred \u00a38m of business combination costs in connection with the transaction. Goodwill of \u00a36m arose on the transaction, as a result of the di/fference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and the consideration paid, which was based on a price per share recognising the access to a signi/ficant pipeline of mixed-use development schemes gained by the acquisition, and the expected synergies and enhancement of the Group's existing development capabilities by adding additional skills and experience to the Group. The Group has considered whether the goodwill is recoverable, and has concluded that it is not. The Group's longer term plans for the developments and the potential synergies with the Group's existing holdings are at an early stage, making the recoverable amount uncertain at this time. \u00a36m of goodwill has therefore been written o/ff to the income statement in the year.\n\nThe fair value of the assets and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition is set out in the table below. As at 31 March 2022, the Group remains in the measurement period for the recognition of assets and liabilities on acquisition of U+I Group PLC. The values provided in the table below are therefore provisional and could be subject to adjustment until the measurement period ends in December 2022:\n\n|                                                                       | U/plus.tfI Group PLC /sterling.tfm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                                |                                      |\n| Investment property, including head leases capitalised                | /nine.tf/eight.tf                    |\n| Investments in joint ventures and associates                          | /five.tf/eight.tf                    |\n| Trading property                                                      | /one.tf/two.tf/eight.tf              |\n| Trade receivables and other assets                                    | /six.tf/two.tf                       |\n| Cash                                                                  | /three.tf/six.tf                     |\n| Total assets                                                          | /three.tf/eight.tf/two.tf            |\n| Liabilities                                                           |                                      |\n| Borrowings                                                            | (/one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf)             |\n| Trade payables and other liabilities                                  | (/eight.tf/seven.tf)                 |\n| Total liabilities                                                     | (/one.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf)           |\n| Net assets                                                            | /one.tf/eight.tf/five.tf             |\n| Fair value of consideration paid                                      | /one.tf/nine.tf/one.tf               |\n| Goodwill recognised                                                   | /six.tf                              |\n| Goodwill impairment                                                   | (/six.tf)                            |\n| Business combination costs                                            | (/eight.tf)                          |\n| Total loss on business combination recognised in the income statement | (/one.tf/four.tf)                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has already made PID dividends relating to 31 March 2022 of \u00a367m, leaving \u00a3132m to be paid in the coming year.\n\nOur latest tax strategy can be found on our corporate website. In the year, the total taxes we incurred and collected were \u00a3154m (2021: \u00a369m), of which \u00a357m (2021: \u00a325m) was directly borne by the Group including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp duty land tax.

Energy consumption is reported as kWh and no normalisation technique is applied. Carbon emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e). We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in accordance to the WRI GHG Protocol.\n\nGHG emissions are broken down into three scopes: scope 1, 2 and 3.\n\nScope 1 emissions are direct emissions from activities controlled by us that release emissions into the atmosphere, while scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions associated with our consumption of purchased energy.\n\nAt Landsec, scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas and refrigerant gases. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All material sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported. As the remaining sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions, we do not report them.\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported using both the 'location-based' and 'market-based' accounting methods. Location-based emissions are reported using the UK Government's 'Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2021'. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply, either obtained directly from the supplier or from their o/fficial company website.\n\nScope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our business activities, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classi/fied as scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identi/fies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec.\n\nTable 76 shows the absolute energy consumption with a breakdown by landlord and tenant consumption. This year, absolute energy intensity has increased by 14% compared with the previous year, largely as a result of the increase in occupancy alongside easing of Covid-19 related restrictions.\n\n| Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions                | Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions              | Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions             | Table 73                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Location-based emissions                         |                                                |                                               |                                               |\n| Emissions                                        | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf//two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf //two.tf/two.tf |\n| Scope /one.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /nine.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf              | /seven.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/four.tf            | /seven.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/one.tf              |\n| Scope /two.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /two.tf/five.tf,/three.tf/eight.tf/two.tf      | /one.tf/eight.tf,/four.tf/three.tf/four.tf    | /one.tf/eight.tf,/three.tf/three.tf/eight.tf  |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf tCO/two.tfe            | /three.tf/four.tf,/five.tf/four.tf/zero.tf     | /two.tf/five.tf,/nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf    | /two.tf/five.tf,/four.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf     |\n| Intensity                                        |                                                |                                               |                                               |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf kgCO/two.tfe/m /two.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf./five.tf/six.tf               | /one.tf/four.tf./two.tf/three.tf              | /one.tf/one.tf/four.tf./one.tf/two.tf         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions                | Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions              | Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions             | Table 74                                      |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Market-based emissions                           | Market-based emissions                         | Market-based emissions                        | Market-based emissions                        |\n| Emissions                                        | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf//two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf//two.tf/one.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf //two.tf/two.tf |\n| Scope /one.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /nine.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf              | /seven.tf,/five.tf/five.tf/four.tf            | /seven.tf,/one.tf/five.tf/one.tf              |\n| Scope /two.tf tCO/two.tfe                        | /three.tf,/seven.tf/one.tf/nine.tf             | /two.tf,/zero.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf             | /two.tf,/zero.tf/five.tf/four.tf              |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf tCO/two.tfe            | /one.tf/two.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf     | /nine.tf,/six.tf/three.tf/three.tf            | /nine.tf,/two.tf/zero.tf/five.tf              |\n| Intensity                                        | Intensity                                      | Intensity                                     | Intensity                                     |\n| Scope /one.tf and /two.tf kgCO/two.tfe/m /two.tf | /six.tf./one.tf/one.tf                         | /five.tf./two.tf/seven.tf                     | /five.tf./one.tf/zero.tf                      |\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have decreased by 2% compared with the previous reporting year. Despite an increase energy consumption driven by higher occupancy levels and the ease of Covid-19 restrictions, there has been marginal decrease in location-based emissions. The decrease has been largely due to changes in emissions factors and actions taken to drive energy e/fficiency across our assets. The detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 can be seen in Chart 75. In terms of market-based emissions, we have seen a decrease of 4% which is largely due to changes in emissions factors.\n\n## Landsec Scope 1 and 2 emissions year on year driving factors\n\nChart 75\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite an increase in energy intensity from higher occupancy and footfall rates, we were able to avoid an even larger increase due to energy e/fficiencies achieved from our active energy management programme.

The chart below shows the largest categories.\n\n## Landsec Scope 3 emissions by category 2021/22\n\nChart 78\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe two largest scope 3 categories are Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, making up 75% of our total emissions.\n\nCapital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities and portfolio projects. Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.\n\nThe emissions from Capital goods has slightly reduced due to the fact that 21 Moor/fields, EC2 had much less carbon-intensive material arriving on site compared to 2020-21 as it nears completion, whilst our other developments entered a more intensive phase of construction, during which material deliveries to site intensify. In the table below, we provide the amount of embodied carbon emissions reported for each development in 2021-22.\n\nIn relation to Downstream leased assets, we continue to increase the share of primary data relating to tenant energy usage (now at 57%, an increase from 44% last year), thereby increasing data accuracy, and this category's increase in emissions (from 35.2% to 40.4% of our total value chain) can be explained by occupancy increases following the lifting of Covid-19 related restrictions and the accompanying increase in tenant energy usage.\n\nBecause both categories represent a signi/ficant proportion of our total carbon footprint, we are committed to understanding the impacts of our buildings as much as we can to ensure that we build and run them as e/fficiently as possible. We therefore undertake life-cycle assessments on all of our development projects, following the RICS guidance document 'Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment' 1st Edition and BS EN 15978. The assessment considers both the embodied carbon emissions from our supply chain and construction activities (stages A1 to A5), as well as anticipated emissions from a building's operations and embodied carbon associated with maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the building (stages B1 to C4). To minimise our construction impacts, we set targets on the embodied carbon emissions and track these through to the completion of our buildings. The table below shows that we'll avoid over 50,000 tCO 2 e by targeting an overall reduction of 22.1% in the embodied carbon across /five developments compared with design stage baseline (RIBA stage 3). We also carefully design our buildings to minimise the energy demand of our operations and meet the remaining demand through renewable electricity contracts.\n\nThis year, we have reviewed our embodied carbon targets for new developments. In next year's report, we will focus on the overall embodied carbon intensity rather than the percentage reduction from design stage as a way of ensuring that we encourage structural retention and material reuse as much as possible on our new schemes.\n\n| Embodied carbon - development pipeline   |                                                  | Forecasted total                                   | Forecasted embodied  /two.tf    | Embodied carbon  reduction %   | Table 79 Embodied carbon                                                         |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Development                              | Total embodied carbon  baseline tCO/two.tf       | embodied carbon tCO/two.tf                         | carbon intensity kgCO/two.tf/m  |                                | emissions reported in  /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf //two.tf/two.tf t CO/two.tf |\n| /two.tf/one.tf Moor/fields, EC/two.tf    | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf,/eight.tf/seven.tf/one.tf | /nine.tf/one.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf             | /one.tf,/two.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | -/two.tf/four.tf./six.tf       | /one.tf/five.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/four.tf                                         |\n| Lucent, W/one.tf                         | /two.tf/seven.tf,/one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf          | /two.tf/one.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/one.tf              | /one.tf,/one.tf/one.tf/three.tf | -/two.tf/one.tf./one.tf        | /eight.tf,/two.tf/eight.tf/three.tf                                              |\n| n/two.tf, SW/one.tf                      | /two.tf/four.tf,/seven.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf,/five.tf/one.tf/seven.tf           | /nine.tf/nine.tf/six.tf         | -/one.tf/seven.tf./two.tf      | /six.tf,/five.tf/seven.tf/five.tf                                                |\n| The Forge, SE/one.tf                     | /two.tf/four.tf,/seven.tf/four.tf/one.tf         | /one.tf/eight.tf,/four.tf/one.tf/four.tf           | /one.tf,/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf  | -/two.tf/five.tf./six.tf       | /five.tf,/three.tf/six.tf/five.tf                                                |\n| Portland House /one.tf , SW/one.tf       | Scope change - no data available                 |                                                    |                                 |                                |                                                                                  |\n| Timber Square /two.tf , SE/one.tf        | /three.tf/two.tf,/three.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf       | /two.tf/seven.tf,/six.tf/seven.tf/six.tf           | /five.tf/three.tf/five.tf       | -/one.tf/four.tf./six.tf       | /five.tf/four.tf/three.tf                                                        |\n| Landsec development pipeline             | /two.tf/two.tf/nine.tf,/nine.tf/zero.tf/two.tf   | /one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf |                                 | -/two.tf/two.tf./one.tf        | /three.tf/six.tf,/one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                                        |\n\n- /one.tf.

This will enable you to receive such communications more quickly and securely, whilst supporting Landsec's sustainability commitment by communicating in a more environmentally friendly and coste/ffective manner. Registration for electronic communications is available via our website: landsec.com/investors or shareview.co.uk.\n\n## UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation and status on payment of dividends\n\nAs a UK REIT, Landsec does not pay corporation tax on Qualifying Activities, which are rental pro/fits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.\n\nAt least 90% of income derived from Qualifying Activities must be distributed as Property Income Distributions (PIDs). For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding tax at 20%. However, certain categories of shareholder may be able to receive PIDs gross, (i.e. without deduction of withholding tax). These categories are principally UK companies, charities, local authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds.\n\nA REIT may additionally pay ordinary dividends which will be treated in the same way as dividends from non-REIT companies.\n\nFurther information on UK REITs and the forms required to be completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the Landsec website or from the Registrar: landsec.com/ investorsshareholders-equity-investors/uk-reit-regime-and-dividends\n\n## Payment of dividends to UK resident shareholders\n\nDividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account or alternatively sign up to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan (see below). Under this arrangement, dividend con/firmations are still sent to your registered address.\n\nReceiving dividends directly into a nominated account has a number of advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on the actual dividend payment date.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so should contact the Registrar (Equiniti) or complete a mandate instruction available on our website landsec.com/investorsshareholders-equity-investors/ dividend-information and return it to the Registrar. Alternatively, these details can be sent via their Equiniti Shareview online account, which is available on our website landsec.com/investors/ shareholders-equity-investors or directly at Equiniti: shareview.co.uk.\n\n## Payment of dividends to non-UK resident shareholders\n\nAs applicable to UK resident shareholders, dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account. Payments to overseas accounts are made a few days after the Company's dividend payment date.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to contact the Registrar (Equiniti) on +44 (0) 121 415 7049/one.numr or download an application form online at shareview.co.uk or provide these details via their Equiniti Shareview online account.\n\nThis service is available in over 90 countries worldwide.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)\n\nThe DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity to use cash dividends to increase their shareholding in Landsec. It is a convenient and cost-e/ffective facility provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. Under the DRIP, cash dividends are automatically used to purchase shares in the market as soon as possible after the dividend payment. Any residual cash will be carried forward to the next dividend payment.\n\nDetails of the DRIP, including terms and conditions and participation election forms, are available on our website: landsec.com/investorsshareholders-equity-investors/dividendreinvestment-plan-drip\n\nThese are also available by post from:\n\nDividend Reinvestment Plans\n\nEquiniti\n\nAspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA\n\nTelephone: 0371 384 2268\u00b9\n\nInternational dialling: +44 121 415 7173\u00b9\n\n## Share dealing facilities\n\nEquiniti provides both existing and prospective UK shareholders with an easy to access and simple-to-use share dealing facility for buying and selling Landsec shares online, by telephone, or post. The online and telephone dealing service allows shareholders to trade 'real-time' at a known price that will be given to them at the time they give their instruction.\n\nFor telephone dealing, call 0345 603 7037 between 8.00am and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales).

These are typically from purported 'brokers' who o/ffer to buy shares at a price often far in excess of their market value. These operations are commonly known as 'boiler rooms'.\n\nShareholders are advised to be very wary of any o/ffers of unsolicited advice, discounted shares, premium prices for shares they own or free reports into the Company.

Net assets per share is also commonly known as net asset value per share (NAV per share).\n\n## Net initial yield\n\nNet initial yield is a calculation by the Group's external valuer of the yield that would be received by a purchaser, based on the estimated net rental income expressed as a percentage of the acquisition cost, being the market value plus assumed usual purchasers' costs at the reporting date. The calculation is in line with EPRA guidance.

Passing rent may be more or less than the ERV (see over-rented, reversionary and ERV). Passing rent excludes annual rent receivable from units in administration save to the extent that rents are expected to be received. Void units at the reporting date are deemed to have no passing rent. Although temporary lets of less than 12 months are treated as void, income from temporary lets is included in passing rents.\n\n## Planning permission\n\nThere are two common types of planning permission: full planning permission and outline planning permission. A full planning permission results in a decision on the detailed proposals on how the site can be developed. The grant of a full planning permission will, subject to satisfaction of any conditions, mean no further engagement with the local planning authority will be required to build the consented development. An outline planning permission approves general principles of how a site can be developed. Outline planning permission is granted subject to conditions known as 'reserved matters'. Consent must be sought and achieved for discharge of all reserved matters within a speci/fied time-limit, normally three years from the date outline planning permission was granted, before building can begin. In both the case of full and outline planning permission, the local planning authority will 'resolve to grant permission'. At this stage, the planning permission is granted subject to agreement of legal documents, in particular the s106 agreement. On execution of the s106 agreement, the planning permission will be issued. Work can begin on satisfaction of any 'pre-commencement' planning conditions.\n\n## Pre-development properties\n\nPre-development properties are those properties within the like-for-like portfolio which are being managed to align vacant possession within a three-year horizon with a view to redevelopment.\n\n## Pre-let\n\nA lease signed with an occupier prior to completion of a development.\n\n## Property Income Distribution (PID)\n\nA PID is a distribution by a REIT to its shareholders paid out of qualifying pro/fits.

It is calculated based on actual transactions and is often used as a reference rate in bank facilities.\n\n## Temporary lettings\n\nLettings for a period of one year or less. These are included within voids.\n\n## Topped-up net initial yield\n\nTopped-up net initial yield is a calculation by the Group's external valuer. It is calculated by making an adjustment to net initial yield in respect of the annualised cash rent foregone through unexpired rent-free periods and other lease incentives. The calculation is consistent with EPRA guidance.\n\n## Total accounting return\n\nDividend paid per share in the year plus the change in EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share, divided by EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share at the beginning of the year. This measure was previously referred to as total business return. There has been no change to the calculation of the measure other than the change of name during the year to 31 March 2022.\n\n## Total cost ratio\n\nTotal cost ratio represents all costs included within EPRA earnings, other than rents payable, /financing costs and provisions for bad and doubtful debts, expressed as a percentage of gross rental income before rents payable adjusted for costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced.\n\n## Total development cost (TDC)\n\nTotal development cost refers to the book value of the site at the commencement of the project, the estimated capital expenditure required to develop the scheme from the start of the /financial year in which the property is added to our development programme, together with capitalised interest, being the Group's borrowing costs associated with direct expenditure on the property under development.

The screen at Piccadilly Lights, W1 is excluded from the vacancy rate calculation as it will always carry advertising although the number and duration of our agreements with advertisers will vary.\n\n## Valuation surplus/de/ficit\n\nThe valuation surplus/de/ficit represents the increase or decrease in the market value of the Combined Portfolio, adjusted for net investment and the e/ffect of accounting for lease incentives under IFRS 16 (previously SIC-15). The market value of the Combined Portfolio is determined by the Group's external valuer.\n\n## Voids\n\nVoids are expressed as a percentage of ERV and represent all unlet space, including voids where refurbishment work is being carried out and voids in respect of pre-development properties.
