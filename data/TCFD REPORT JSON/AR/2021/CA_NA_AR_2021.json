In this ever-evolving  context,  the  Bank's  support  of  its employees, clients, and communities remains unwavering, guided by our One Mission of Putting People First.\n\nThe  Bank  delivered  outstanding  financial  performance  in 2021, reflective of the strategic choices we have made, the strength and adaptability of our franchise, and our earnings diversification.\n\n## O Ouurr  ccuullttuurree  ooff  aaggiilliittyy  aanndd  ccoollllaabboorraattiioonn  ccoonnttiinnuueedd t too  bbee  aa  ttrruuee  ccoommppeettiittiivvee  aaddvvaannttaaggee  ffoorr  tthhee B Baannkk  aanndd  tthhee  ccoorrnneerrssttoonnee  ooff  oouurr  ccoonnssiisstteenntt p peerrffoorrmmaannccee  ttrraacckk  rreeccoorrdd..\n\nIn 2021, the Bank delivered superior growth in revenue and income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes compared to last year, driven by continued momentum in all our businesses. The Bank generated strong organic growth and  industry-leading  return  on  equity  while  maintaining strong  capital  levels  and  prudent  allowances  for  credit losses.  The  Bank  was  also  top  of  the  class  in  total shareholder returns for the three-, five-, ten-, and twentyyear periods.\n\nThe Bank's sustained performance since the beginning of the pandemic demonstrates that we have pursued the right strategies in terms of business mix, capital allocation, and risk management  over  the  last  several  years.  These strategies will continue to guide the Bank's approach and decision-making well into the future.\n\n## S Sttrroonngg  PPiillllaarrss  SSuuppppoorrttiinngg  CCoonnttiinnuueedd  GGrroowwtthh\n\nAs a Canadian bank with a leading franchise in Quebec, we are anchored in one of North America's most diversified and structurally  sound  economies.  As  a  result,  we  are  a longstanding personal and commercial banking partner of choice  in  the  province  and  well-positioned  to  continue benefitting from Quebec's economic strength.\n\nClients are-and must remain-at the core of everything we do.  Our  digital  transformation  continues  as  we  aim  to further optimize our processes and enhance  client experience. This commitment, supported by the depth of our relationships and the quality of our advice, will remain key as we seek to provide Canadian clients with a best-inclass experience.\n\nOur Wealth Management segment is an established leader in targeted niches, boasts a highly differentiated positioning,  and  generates  low-capital-intensity  organic growth and a superior return on equity. As such, our wealth business represents an important long-term growth lever for the Bank.\n\nOur  Financial  Markets  segment  is  a  high  performing, focused,  and  agile  franchise.  It  is  an  important  pillar, providing the Bank with resilience and earnings diversification. Our objective is to continue consolidating our leadership positions and to grow in selected markets.\n\nAcross  the  Bank,  we  will  continue  to  leverage  the collaborative models already deployed to stimulate further growth  opportunities  among  our  businesses.  We  expect investments  and  savings  to  increasingly  become  anchor products, as we generate synergies across the franchise, with the client always at the centre of our decision-making.\n\nBeyond  Canada,  our  strategy  has  consistently  delivered strong organic growth and high returns. Credigy is a leader in U.S. consumer finance in select niches, while ABA Bank is a thriving bank in Cambodia.

The  Board  is  proud  of  the compassion shown by the Bank, reflecting our commitment to our One Mission of Putting People First.\n\nThe Board is equally proud of the exceptional performance delivered across the franchise last year. The Bank's results confirm the sound strategic choices made over the years and its strong culture of agility.\n\nWhile continuing to provide counsel and support to senior management in a complex environment, the Board forged ahead  with  key  long-term  priorities  in  a  fast-evolving industry. Priority areas in 2021 included succession planning; oversight  of  key  risks;  culture  and  talent  development; technology;  environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG) matters; and strategic planning.\n\n## C CEEOO  SSuucccceessssiioonn\n\nIn many ways, 2021 was a year of transition, as the Board completed a rigorous multi-year succession process for the Bank's CEO. Louis Vachon, our CEO since 2007, announced his intention to retire at the end of October 2021, and the Board appointed Laurent Ferreira to succeed him.\n\nDuring Louis' nearly 15-year tenure as CEO, the Bank made remarkable  financial  and  cultural  progress.  Louis  helped build  a  strong,  diversified,  and  agile  Bank  that  has experienced sustained growth in Canada and abroad. The Board both recognizes and thanks him for his invaluable contributions through the years and for the strong legacy he leaves behind.\n\nThe  Board  is  pleased  to  be  able  to  count  on  Laurent Ferreira to lead the Bank in its next chapter. Laurent has a strong  track  record  of  strategic  leadership  as  well  as  a deep  understanding  of  the  Bank,  the  banking  industry, global markets, and risk management. Having been a key player in the Bank's multi-year transformation and cultural shift, Laurent also led the development of our new threeyear strategic plan.

From our corporate  offices  to  our  branches,  we  must  attract  and retain  increasingly  mobile  talent  in  a  competitive  labour market. The Board  continues to work closely with management  to  ensure  that  the  Bank  has  the  right strategies and tools in place for a post-pandemic world.\n\nWe  must  also  cultivate  our  culture  of  adaptability  to maintain a dynamic workplace where employees can grow and thrive. In 2021, the Bank published its first inclusion and diversity booklet outlining its three-year strategy, areas of action, partnerships, and performance indicators. The Board continues to actively monitor the Bank's progress on these fronts and to support management in its efforts to remain an employer of choice while promoting our culture as a key competitive advantage.\n\n## C Clliimmaattee  CCoommmmiittmmeennttss\n\nThe Bank's ESG strategy, including its efforts to manage climate-related  risks  and  opportunities,  is  one  of  the Board's top priorities. In recent years, the Bank has adopted several measures to strengthen its climate commitments, notably by supporting the UN's Principles for Responsible Banking, by aligning our disclosure with the recommendations made by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), through our responsible investments and, most recently, by setting  an  ambitious  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions reduction target by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement.",

        "page_content": "## Message From the Chairman of the Board (cont.)\n\nThis past year, the Bank took additional meaningful steps by publishing its second TCFD report and by joining the Partnership  for  Carbon  Accounting  Financials,  a  global partnership of financial institutions created to develop a common  approach  to  assess  and  disclose  the  GHG emissions associated with client loans and investments. In late 2021, the Bank joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a global  industry-led  initiative  to  accelerate  efforts  to address climate change.\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality by 2050 from a client lending and investment perspective remains one of our industry's biggest  commitments  and  challenges.  We  continue  to actively work to establish a science-based framework of metrics  and  interim  targets,  a  crucial  step  towards  the development of our roadmap to carbon neutrality.\n\n## B Booaarrdd  RReenneewwaall\n\nIn 2021, Raymond Bachand completed a seven-year term as  a  director,  and  we  sincerely  thank  him  for  his  many contributions  during  his  tenure.  His  extensive  experience, particularly  in  major  public  office  positions,  has  been instrumental to the Board's work since 2014. We welcomed Macky Tall to fill the vacancy and couldn't be more pleased to have him on board. A partner and chair of The Carlyle Group's  Infrastructure  group  since  September  2021,  and having previously served 16 years in executive positions at the  Caisse  de  d\u00e9p\u00f4t  et  placement  du  Qu\u00e9bec,  Macky brings  extensive  experience  in  finance,  in  business  risk management  as  well  as  in  sustainable  development.  As part of our CEO succession process, Laurent Ferreira also joined the Board in 2021, in anticipation of Louis Vachon's retirement.\n\n## R Reeaaddyy  ffoorr  tthhee  FFuuttuurree\n\nAs  Chair,  I  am  incredibly  proud  of  how  the  Bank  has adapted  and  navigated  what  has  become  a  prolonged and multi-year pandemic. We have not compromised on our  ability  to  show  compassion  while  leveraging  our strengths to deliver a stellar financial performance, and we have forged ahead with key priorities to ensure our longterm success.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the great dedication  and  passion  of  our  employees  and  strong leadership team, and for this I thank them. I also wish to reiterate the Board's commitment to our employees, clients, communities and shareholders, and to delivering long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nThe Bank has a strong foundation and resilient businesses. We look forward with confidence and optimism under new leadership, and  with a winning team  and  culture. Regardless of the challenges that may lie ahead, we are ready for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## J Jeeaann  HHoouuddee\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\nFor  more  information  regarding  the  Bank's  governance, please  refer  to  the  Statement of Corporate Practices available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca.",

In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media and others. All such statements are made in accordance with applicable securities legislation in Canada and the United States. Forward-looking statements in this document may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the economy-particularly the Canadian and U.S. economies-market changes, the Bank's objectives, outlook and priorities for fiscal year 2022 and beyond, the strategies or actions that will be taken to achieve them, expectations for the Bank's financial condition, the regulatory environment in which it operates, the potential impacts of-and the Bank's response to-the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain risks it faces. These forward-looking statements are typically identified by verbs or words such as 'outlook', 'believe', 'foresee', 'forecast', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'project', 'expect', 'intend' and 'plan', in their future or conditional forms, notably verbs such as 'will', 'may', 'should', 'could' or 'would' as well as similar terms and expressions. Such forward-looking statements are made for the purpose of assisting the holders of the Bank's securities in understanding the Bank's financial position and results of operations as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, as well as the Bank's vision, strategic objectives, and financial performance targets, and may not be appropriate for other purposes.\n\nBy their very nature, these forward-looking statements require assumptions to be made and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific. Assumptions about the performance of the Canadian and U.S. economies in 2022, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and how that will affect the Bank's business are among the main factors considered in setting the Bank's strategic priorities and objectives including provisions for credit losses. In determining its expectations for economic conditions, both broadly and in the financial services sector in particular, the Bank primarily considers historical economic data provided by the governments of Canada, the United States and certain other countries in which the Bank conducts business, as well as their agencies.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that the Bank's express or implied predictions, forecasts, projections, expectations or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that its assumptions may not be confirmed and that its vision, strategic objectives and financial performance targets will not be achieved. The Bank recommends that readers not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as a number of factors, many of which are beyond the Bank's control, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause actual results to differ significantly from the expectations, estimates or intentions expressed in these forwardlooking statements. These risk factors include credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, environmental and social risk, and certain emerging risks or risks deemed significant, all of which are described in greater detail in the Risk Management section beginning on page 69 of this Annual Report. These risk factors also include, among others, the general economic environment and financial market conditions in Canada, the United States, and other countries where the Bank operates; exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations; higher funding costs and greater market volatility; changes made to fiscal, monetary and other public policies; changes made to regulations that affect the Bank's business; geopolitical and sociopolitical uncertainty; the transition to a low-carbon economy and the Bank's ability to satisfy stakeholder expectations on environmental and social issues; significant changes in consumer behaviour; the housing situation, real estate market, and household indebtedness in Canada; the Bank's ability to achieve its long-term strategies and key short-term priorities; the timely development and launch of new products and services; the Bank's ability to recruit and retain key personnel; technological innovation and heightened competition from established companies and from competitors offering non-traditional services; changes in the performance and creditworthiness of the Bank's clients and counterparties; the Bank's exposure to significant regulatory matters or litigation; changes made to the accounting policies used by the Bank to report financial information, including the uncertainty inherent to assumptions and critical accounting estimates; changes to tax legislation in the countries where the Bank operates, i.e., primarily Canada and the United States; changes made to capital and liquidity guidelines as well as to the presentation and interpretation thereof; changes to the credit ratings assigned to the Bank; potential disruption to key suppliers of goods and services to the Bank; potential disruptions to the Bank's information technology systems, including evolving cyberattack risk as well as identity theft and theft of personal information; and possible impacts of major events affecting the local and global economies, including international conflicts, natural disasters, and public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. The foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive. Additional information about these risk factors is provided in the Risk Management section and in the COVID-19 Pandemic section of this Annual Report and may be updated in the quarterly shareholders' report subsequently published. Investors and others who rely on the Bank's forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail.

        "page_content": "## C COOVVIIDD--1199  PPaannddeemmiicc\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the COVID-19 outbreak constituted a pandemic, requiring important protective measures to be taken to prevent overcrowding of health services and to strengthen preventive hygiene. This global pandemic prompted many countries, including Canada, to implement lockdown and social distancing measures designed to prevent new outbreaks. In many countries, those measures included the closing of aerial, maritime, and land borders.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, some of the restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic were eased, but subsequent waves of COVID-19 in autumn 2020 forced authorities in a number of countries, including Canada, to reintroduce lockdown measures, effectively shutting down parts of the economy again. During the winter of 2021, a vaccination campaign began in Canada and picked up steam in the spring, leading to a reopening in early summer 2021. The authorities in  many  countries,  including  Canada,  actively  worked  to  ensure  that  widespread  vaccination  coverage  was  achieved  as  quickly  as  possible.  However, uncertainty remains regarding the long-term effectiveness of the vaccines, the acceptance thereof by the public, and the anticipated reduction of infection rates, especially given a rise in cases linked to COVID-19 variants, which appear to be more contagious. Certain measures by the public health authorities in Canada are expected to remain in place to continue limiting the spread of COVID-19 and its variants.\n\nIn Canada, banking services are considered essential services and were therefore maintained despite the lockdown and social distancing measures. Given the current economic and social conditions, the Bank is committed to supporting its employees, clients, and communities.\n\n## I Immppaacctt  ooff  tthhee  CCOOVVIIDD--1199  RRiisskk  FFaaccttoorr\n\nAt its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic had disruptive and adverse effects in the countries where the Bank operates and, more broadly, on the global economy. Among other disruptions, COVID-19 sent stock markets into sharp decline and rendered them more volatile, disrupted global supply chains, triggered a rapid and sudden rise in unemployment, and prompted an economic slowdown. In spring 2020, governments, monetary authorities, and regulators intervened to support the economy and the financial system, notably by deploying fiscal and monetary measures designed to increase liquidity and support incomes. They also eased the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on financial institutions. While a global economic rebound was seen during fiscal 2021, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists, in particular through subsequent waves, its impacts on the global economy could worsen and the measures in place might not be enough over the long term to completely avoid recessive conditions.\n\nAside from its impacts on the global economy and in the countries where the Bank operates, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, impacts on the Bank, on the way in which it operates, and on its clients. Since much of the Bank's business involves granting loans or providing liquidity to clients (which include individuals, businesses, and governments), the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on these clients could have a significant adverse effect on the Bank's business, results of operations, financial position, and reputation by, for example, causing higher credit losses. Given the measures taken by the Bank to support telework, which could continue for some time, and given increased client use of digital tools, the Bank, its clients, and its service providers are also exposed to a greater risk of cyberthreats, cyberattacks, breaches, and fraudulent activities as well as to operational risks. The Bank closely monitors its operations to detect any indications of increased phishing, fraud, privacy breaches, and cyberattacks, and it raises awareness about information security threats among its clients, employees, and service providers. The Bank is unaware of how the societal landscape (including changes in consumer behaviour, in policies, and in regulations) will evolve or how it will have changed after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has put into perspective and may continue to put into perspective many of the top and emerging risks to which the Bank is exposed, i.e., credit risk, market risk, liquidity and funding risk, operational risk, regulatory compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, information security and cybersecurity risk, and the risk of reliance on technology and third parties. These risks are described in more detail in the Risk Management section of this MD&A.\n\nThe Bank is continuing to closely monitor the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is not possible to predict the full impacts that the pandemic will have on the global economy, on the countries in which the Bank operates, on the Bank's clients, and on the Bank itself, including its business activities, results of operations, financial position, regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, reputation, and ability to satisfy regulatory requirements. The actual impacts will depend on future events that are highly uncertain, including the extent, severity, and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and on the effectiveness of actions and measures taken by governments, monetary authorities, and regulators over the long term.\n\n## RReelliieeff  MMeeaassuurreess  ffoorr  CClliieennttss\n\nIn response to the economic and financial environment caused by COVID-19, the Bank announced, from the onset of the pandemic, a series of measures to support the clients of its main business segments. Some of the measures were introduced by the Canadian government and regulatory authorities, together with the Canadian banks, and were rolled out quickly to come to the assistance of individuals and businesses. These measures were designed to provide financial support specifically to clients facing the economic consequences of COVID-19.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "A number of the relief measures offered to the Bank's clients at the start of the pandemic ended in 2020, although some measures were being offered as part of various government programs in which the Bank is participating. These measures consist mainly of loans backed by government guarantees, particularly for businesses operating in sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. In the normal course of business, the Bank is continuing to address the specific needs of its clients to support them during this unprecedented crisis.\n\n## K Keeyy  MMeeaassuurreess  IInnttrroodduucceedd  bbyy  tthhee  RReegguullaattoorryy  AAuutthhoorriittiieess\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, several Government of Canada agencies, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (Canada) (OSFI), and other regulatory authorities governing the Bank's activities have taken a number of actions to reinforce the resilience of Canadian banks and to improve the stability of the Canadian financial system and economy in response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 and economic conditions. Described in point form below are the key measures introduced by OSFI and the Bank of Canada in March 2020 that continued to affect the Bank during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.\n\n## Capital Management\n\n- \uf0b7 Domestic stability buffer (the buffer): On March 13, 2020, OSFI lowered the buffer from 2.25% of risk-weighted assets to 1.0%, effective on that date. The purpose of this measure was to raise the capacity of domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) to supply credit to the economy during an expected period of disruption related to COVID-19 and market conditions. OSFI also indicated that it was expecting all banks to cease any dividend increases or share buybacks. On June 17, 2021, OSFI raised the buffer level such that it would be 2.5% starting October 31, 2021. On November 4, 2021, OSFI updated its capital distribution expectations by permitting financial institutions to raise regular dividends and, subject to OSFI approval, buy back shares.\n- \uf0b7 Treatment of regulatory capital for expected credit loss accounting purposes: On March 27, 2020, OSFI introduced transitional arrangements applicable to the ECL provisioning method set out in the Basel framework. Under the arrangement, a portion of allowances that would otherwise have been included in Tier 2 capital will be included in CET1 capital. While the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is allowing jurisdictions to apply a 100% addback of allowances to CET1 capital, OSFI believed that a maximum add-back of 70% was appropriate. This increased amount is adjusted for tax effects and multiplied by a scaling factor that decreases over time. The scaling factor has been set at 70% for fiscal 2020, at 50% for fiscal 2021, and at 25% for fiscal 2022. Given the three-year transition period, banks can phase-in the impact of increased ECL allowances in CET1 capital while also acknowledging that these allowances have been recorded.\n- \uf0b7 Reduction of stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR) multipliers under market risk: On March 27, 2020, OSFI announced that banks subject to market risk capital requirements and using the AIRB approach could reduce by two the stressed VaR multiplier that was being applied at the end of the first quarter of 2020. This reduction could be applied retrospectively to the beginning of the second quarter of 2020. On March 16, 2021, OSFI announced the unwinding of this temporary reduction and returned the VaR multipliers back to the pre-pandemic level, with an implementation date of May 1, 2021.\n- \uf0b7 Capital floor: On March 27, 2020, OSFI lowered the floor factor from 75% to 70%. The 70% floor factor is expected to stay in place until the domestic implementation of the Basel III capital floor in the first quarter of 2023. The 70% factor ensures that the floor continues to protect against model risk while maintaining the risk sensitivity of the capital framework for banks subject to the AIRB approach.\n- \uf0b7 Leverage ratio: On March 27, 2020, OSFI announced that banks could temporarily exclude the following exposures for leverage ratio purposes: (1) central bank reserves; (2) sovereign-issued securities that qualify as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline. On November 5, 2020, OSFI announced that this treatment would remain in place until December 31, 2021. On August 12, 2021, OSFI confirmed that the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities that qualify as HQLA would not be extended beyond December 31, 2021. Central bank reserves will, however, continue to be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure.\n- \uf0b7 Margin required for non-centrally cleared derivatives: In line with a decision by the BCBS and International Organization of Securities Commissions, on March 27, 2020, OSFI extended by one year the deadline for implementing the final two phases of the initial margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives outlined in OSFI's E-22 guideline. With this extension, the final implementation phase will take place on September 1, 2022, at which point covered entities with an aggregate average notional amount (AANA) of non-centrally cleared derivatives greater than $12 billion will be subject to the requirements. As an intermediate step, as of September 1, 2021, entities with an AANA of non-centrally cleared derivatives greater than $75 billion are being subject to the requirements.\n- \uf0b7 Delaying implementation of the Basel III reforms: The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the BCBS, announced a postponement to the implementation of the reforms of the Basel III capital international standard published in December 2017. On March 27, 2020, OSFI therefore postponed, until the first quarter of 2023, the implementation dates applicable to the revisions to the Standardized Approach and AIRB Approach to credit risk, the operational risk framework, and the leverage ratio framework, as well as the introduction of a more risk-sensitive capital floor. Implementation of the Pillar 3 financial disclosure requirements finalized by the BCBS in December 2018 has also been delayed until at least the first quarter of 2023. On November 29, 2021, OSFI postponed the implementation of the above-mentioned Basel III reform items until the second quarter of 2023. Lastly, implementation of the final set of revisions to the new market risk framework entitled Fundamental Review of the Trading Book published in January 2019 as well as the revised credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework is being postponed to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Capital Management section of this MD&A.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity Management\n\n- \uf0b7 Monetary policy: Since the start of the pandemic, the Bank of Canada has used monetary policy to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. For example, it lowered the overnight rate target by 150 basis points to 0.25%. Longer-term interest rates have also declined significantly, and the interest rates of the Government of Canada curve are now mostly below 1%.\n- \uf0b7 Liquidity facilities and asset purchase program of the Bank of Canada: The liquidity facilities include the term repo facility for which, on April 3, 2020, the Bank of Canada announced that the terms of the loans had been extended and the list of eligible collateral expanded. A new standing term liquidity facility (STLF) was introduced to round out the existing liquidity tools and to further strengthen the resilience of the Canadian financial system. Asset purchase programs implemented by the Bank of Canada and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) cover a wide range of securities (treasury bills, bankers' acceptances, bonds, and mortgage-backed securities) and issuers (government and corporate). All of these programs stabilized the funding markets and supported the flow of credit to households and businesses. On March 23, 2021, given continued operational improvement in the Canadian financial markets in general, the Bank of Canada announced an end to the programs deployed in 2020.\n- \uf0b7 Covered bond limit: The covered bond limit was temporarily increased in April 2020 to provide better access to Bank of Canada facilities, and the banks were allowed to draw on their HQLA assets, thereby falling below the 100% threshold required by the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline for the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR). On April 6, 2021, OSFI announced that the temporary increase to the covered bond limit was being unwound effective immediately.\n\nThe Bank entered the crisis in a strong liquidity position. Throughout fiscal years 2021 and 2020, it has maintained sound and prudent management of liquidity. In light of the government liquidity facilities and household and business needs, the Bank is maintaining a liquidity buffer that will enable it to further support its clients.\n\nFor additional information, refer to the Risk Management - Liquidity and Funding Risk section of the MD&A.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg  MMeetthhoodd\n\nThe Bank's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS, as issued by the IASB. The financial statements also comply with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by OSFI, the consolidated financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS, which represent Canadian GAAP. None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS.\n\nOn November 1, 2020, the Bank amended the classification of certain Consolidated Statement of Income amounts to better reflect the nature of the revenues reported in the Wealth Management segment. The reclassifications were made retrospectively among the Non-interest income items. These reclassifications had no impact on the totals of these income items or on Net income.\n\n## N Noonn--GGAAAAPP  aanndd  OOtthheerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess\n\nThe Bank uses a number of financial measures when assessing its results and measuring overall performance. Some of these financial measures are not calculated  in  accordance  with  GAAP.  Regulation 52-112 respecting Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure  (Regulation  52-112)  prescribes disclosure requirements that apply to the following measures used by the Bank:\n\n- \uf0b7 non-GAAP financial measures;\n- \uf0b7 non-GAAP ratios;\n- \uf0b7 supplementary financial measures;\n- \uf0b7 capital management measures;\n- \uf0b7 segment measures.\n\n## N Noonn--GGAAAAPP  FFiinnaanncciiaall  MMeeaassuurreess\n\nThe Bank uses non-GAAP financial measures that do not have standardized meanings under GAAP and that therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Presenting non-GAAP financial measures helps readers to better understand how management analyzes results, shows the impacts of specified items on the results of the reported periods, and allows readers to assess results without the specified items if they consider such items not to be reflective of the underlying performance of the Bank's operations. The Bank excludes from its results certain specified items that are inherently unpredictable. In addition, like many other financial institutions, the Bank uses the taxable equivalent basis to calculate net interest income, non-interest income, and income taxes. This calculation method consists of grossing up certain tax-exempt income (particularly dividends) by the income tax that would have been otherwise payable. An equivalent amount is added to income taxes. This adjustment is necessary in order to perform a uniform comparison of the return on different assets regardless of their tax treatment.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

During the year ended October 31, 2021, in accordance with Regulation 52-109 Respecting Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings (Regulation 52-109), released by the CSA, the design and operation of these controls and procedures were evaluated to determine their effectiveness.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the CEO and the CFO confirmed the effectiveness of the DC&P. These controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information disclosed in annual and interim filings and in other reports filed or submitted under securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by that legislation. These controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Bank's management, including its signing officers, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\nThis Annual Report was reviewed by the Disclosure Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Bank's Board of Directors (the Board), which approved it prior to publication.\n\n## I Inntteerrnnaall  CCoonnttrroollss  OOvveerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg\n\nThe internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial information presented is reliable and that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP, which are based on IFRS, unless indicated otherwise as explained on pages 18 to 21 of this MD&A. Due to inherent limitations, the ICFR may not prevent or detect all misstatements in a timely manner.\n\nThe CEO and the CFO oversaw the evaluation work performed on the design and operation of the Bank's ICFR in accordance with Regulation 52-109. These controls were evaluated in accordance with the control framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO - 2013) for financial controls and in accordance with the control framework of the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) for general information technology controls.\n\nBased on the evaluation results, the CEO and CFO concluded, as at October 31, 2021, that there are no material weaknesses, that the ICFR are effective and provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting is reliable, and that the Bank's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n## C Chhaannggeess  ttoo  IInntteerrnnaall  CCoonnttrroollss  OOvveerr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg\n\nThe CEO and CFO also undertook work whereby they were able to conclude that, during the year ended October 31, 2021, no changes were made to the ICFR that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the design or operation of the ICFR.\n\n## D Diisscclloossuurree  CCoommmmiitttteeee\n\nThe Disclosure Committee assists the CEO and CFO by ensuring that disclosure controls and procedures and internal control procedures for financial reporting are implemented and operational. In so doing, the committee ensures that the Bank is meeting its disclosure obligations under current regulations and that the CEO and CFO are producing the requisite certifications.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

When the Bank sets its medium-term objectives, it does not  take  specified  items  into  consideration,  as  such  items  are  inherently  unpredictable. Management therefore excludes specified items when assessing the Bank's performance against its objectives.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, the Bank recorded $3,177 million in net income compared to $2,083 million in fiscal 2020, and its diluted earnings per share stood at $8.96 compared to $5.70 in fiscal 2020. The Bank's fiscal 2021 return on common shareholders' equity (ROE) was 20.7% versus 14.9% in fiscal 2020. Net income excluding specified items totalled $3,184 million in fiscal 2021, and diluted earnings per share excluding specified items stood at $8.98, up 48% from $6.06 in fiscal 2020. Furthermore, ROE excluding specified items was 20.8% in fiscal 2021 versus 15.8% in fiscal 2020.\n\nThe following table compares the Bank's medium-term objectives with its fiscal 2021 results.\n\n## M Meeddiiuumm--TTeerrmm  OObbjjeeccttiivveess  aanndd  22002211  RReessuullttss\n\n|                                                                | M Meeddiiuumm-- t teerrmm   o obbjjeeccttiivveess   ( (%%))   | 2 2002211   r reessuullttss  ((%%))   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Growth in diluted earnings per share excluding specified items | 5 5--1100                                                     | 4 488..22                             |\n| ROE excluding specified items (2)                              | 1 155--2200                                                   | 2 200..88                             |\n| Dividend payout ratio excluding specified items (2)            | 4 400--5500                                                   | 3 311..33                             |\n| CET1 capital ratio (3)                                         | > >  1111..0000                                               | 1 122..44                             |\n| Leverage ratio (3)                                             | > >  33..7755                                                 | 4 4..44                               |\n\nThe Bank's financial results met all of its medium-term objectives, except for the dividend payout ratio. Growth in diluted earnings per share excluding specified items stood at 48%, significantly surpassing the objective and was due to the lower provisions for credit losses in fiscal 2021 arising from improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and in credit conditions compared to fiscal 2020 as well as from revenue growth in all business segments. ROE excluding specified items was slightly above target owing to a sharp rise in net income excluding specified items. The CET1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio, at 12.4% and 4.4%, respectively , were also above target . As for the dividend payout ratio excluding specified items, it was below the target distribution range given the OSFIprescribed interruption to dividend increases, in effect since March 13, 2020, and given strong growth in net income.\n\n- (1) For additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21.\n- (2) For additional information on non-GAAP ratios, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21 and see the Glossary section on pages 123 to 126.\n- (3) For additional information on capital management measures, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The increase in the CET1 capital ratio since October 31, 2020 was essentially due to net income net of dividends, common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan, and remeasurements of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans. These factors were partly offset by the organic growth in RWA, by the impact of the transitional measures applicable to ECL provisioning, of which the scaling factor decreased to 50% from 70%, by the impact of unwinding the temporary reduction of stressed VaR multipliers, and by the impact of the acquisition of Flinks. The stability seen in the Tier 1 capital ratio and in the Total capital  ratio  is  explained  essentially  by  redemptions  of  the  Series  34  and  Series  36  preferred shares, tempered by the above-mentioned factors and by the issuance of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) - Series 2. As at October 31, 2021, the leverage ratio was 4.4%, stable compared to October 31, 2020. The growth in Tier 1 capital, explained by the above-mentioned factors, and significant growth in total exposure were partly offset by temporary measures announced by OSFI with  respect  to  the  exclusion  of  exposures  from  central  bank  reserves  and  sovereign-issued securities that qualify as HQLA securities under the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline.\n\n- (1) For additional information on capital management measures, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21.\n\n## H Hiigghh--QQuuaalliittyy  LLooaann  PPoorrttffoolliioo\n\nLoans and acceptances, net of allowances for credit losses, accounted for 51% of the Bank's total assets and amounted to $182.7 billion as at October 31, 2021. For fiscal 2021, the Bank recorded $2 million in provisions for credit losses, $844 million less than those recorded in fiscal 2020. This decrease was due to lower provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans owing to an improved macroeconomic  outlook  in  fiscal  2021  compared  to  the  significant  deterioration  in  the macroeconomic  outlook  caused  by  COVID-19  in  fiscal  2020.  This  decrease  was  also  due  to provisions for credit losses recorded on Personal Banking impaired loans (including credit card receivables) that were below pre-pandemic levels, in particular due to a decrease in insolvencies, a reduction  in  client  spending  in  the  context  of  the  pandemic,  and  various  assistance  measures implemented by governments. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans in Commercial Banking and in the USSF&I segment (essentially the Credigy subsidiary) were also down in fiscal 2021. The fiscal 2021 provisions for credit losses on impaired loans represented 0.11% of average loans and acceptances compared to 0.23% in fiscal 2020.\n\n## RRiisskk  PPrrooffiillee\n\nAs at October 31 or for the year ended October 31\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                              | 2 2002211   | 2020       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| Provisions for credit losses                                                                | 2 2         | 846        |\n| Provisions for credit losses as a % of average loans and      acceptances (1)               | - -         | % % 0.53 % |\n| Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans  as a % of average loans and acceptances (1) | 0 0..1111   | % % 0.23 % |\n| Net write-offs as a % of average loans and acceptances (1)                                  | 0 0..0099   | % % 0.16 % |\n| Gross impaired loans (2)                                                                    | 6 66622     | 817        |\n| Net impaired loans (3)                                                                      | 2 28833     | 465        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E Evvoolluuttiioonn  ooff  RReegguullaattoorryy  RRaattiiooss  UUnnddeerr B Baasseell  IIIIII\n\nAs at October 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCET1\n\nTier 1\n\nTotal\n\n- Leverage ratio\n\n## B Brreeaakkddoowwnn  ooff  tthhee  AAvveerraaggee  LLooaann  aanndd (1)\n\n## A Acccceeppttaannccee  PPoorrttffoolliioo\n\nAs at October 31, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Personal Banking (2020: 52%)\n- Commercial Banking (2020: 25%)\n- Wealth Management (2020: 3%)\n- Financial Markets - Corporate Banking (2020: 12%)\n- U.S. Specialty Finance and International (2020: 8%)\n- (1) Excluding loans and acceptances in the Other heading\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

In Europe, a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases coupled with a spike in energy prices could certainly dampen consumer spending and business profitability. The news coming out of China has also been mixed. Given soaring electricity prices earlier this year, Beijing was forced to impose temporary power cuts, which obviously had repercussions on manufacturing operations. Now that the energy situation is improving, COVID-19 is limiting plant operations. The woes of the real estate sector, which is currently engaged in a painful debt reduction process, are also noteworthy. Despite these challenges, the global economy is still expected to grow by 4.0% (1) in 2022, after posting 5.5% (1) growth this year.\n\nU.S. economic growth slowed abruptly in the third quarter. While consumption of services continues to recover, residential investment and consumption of goods are pointing to more moderate trends after spectacular growth in the last few quarters. Weak consumer goods spending has been exacerbated by increasingly acute supply problems, especially in the automotive sector. While it is hard to predict when the supply chain bottlenecks will disappear, it appears likely that some production limitations will persist until some time in 2022. We nonetheless remain confident that economic growth will accelerate in the final quarter of 2021 and that robust growth will continue in 2022. As we have often mentioned in the past, U.S. households are doing very well, after accumulating huge amounts of excess savings since the onset of the pandemic. Their net worth has also risen significantly thanks to strong stock market performance and rising house prices. We expect to see solid growth of 3.4% (1) in 2022, following 5.5% (1) growth in 2021.\n\n## CCaannaaddiiaann  EEccoonnoommyy\n\nUnlike the global economy, which appears to be slowing down, the Canadian economy is performing relatively well. Employment has returned to pre-pandemic levels in just under 19 months. That's not only the fastest recovery seen in the past four recessions but also an outstanding performance compared to the U.S.-where employment levels remain at nearly 3% below the pre-recession peak. Canada's private sector brought in 618,000 more workers between May and October-the largest increase ever seen excluding the post-lockdown reopening period in 2020. While an upsurge in raw material prices will continue to benefit the Canadian economy, supply chain disruptions and the resulting inflation are a risk in the current context. That said, the labour market recovery suggests that Canadian households are ready to stand on their own with no extraordinary government assistance. Substantial surplus savings have already been amassed (11.4% of GDP), helping to cushion the blow of the rising cost of living. We therefore anticipate 4.9% (1) and 3.8% (1) growth in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Q Quueebbeecc  EEccoonnoommyy\n\nDue to high vaccination rates, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations remains under control, making it possible to continue lifting some of the public health measures. While GDP has returned to above pre-pandemic levels, employment numbers still point to a slight shortfall that is expected to reverse in the coming months. In spite of all this, Quebec continues to post the lowest unemployment rate of the four largest provinces in a context of weak demographic growth. Home sales and housing starts recently became more tempered although levels remain high, on a historical basis, in a context where the number of houses for sale on the market remains limited. We remain optimistic that Quebec will continue its economic recovery in 2022 given its highly diverse economy, the Quebec government's fiscal leeway and the fact that Quebec households are in a stronger financial position than elsewhere in the country. More affordable housing prices are less vulnerable to a correction in the event of an interest rate hike. After an expected 6.4% (1) growth in 2021, the Quebec economy should grow at a more moderate rate of 3.0% (1) in 2022.\n\n- (1) GDP growth forecasts, Economy and Strategy group, National Bank Financial\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## A Annaallyyssiiss  ooff  CCoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  RReessuullttss\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  RReessuullttss\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank's net income totalled $3,177 million compared to $2,083 million in fiscal 2020, a 53% year-over-year increase that was due to a significant decrease in provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans, as macroeconomic and credit conditions improved from fiscal 2020, and to a significant reduction in provisions for credit losses on impaired loans. Also contributing to the net income growth was the excellent performance turned in by all  the  Bank's  business  segments,  notably  achieved  through  revenue  growth.  For  fiscal  2021,  specified  items,  net  of  income  taxes,  had  a  $7  million unfavourable impact on net income compared to a $133 million unfavourable impact in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 specified item, net of income taxes, was a $7 million impairment loss on intangible assets. The fiscal 2020 specified items, net of income taxes, had consisted of a $36 million foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries, $52 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $35 million in severance pay, and a $10 million charge related to Maple. For fiscal 2021, the Bank's net income excluding specified items totalled $3,184 million, up 44% from $2,216 million in fiscal 2020.\n\n## T Toottaall  RReevveennuueess\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank's total revenues amounted to $8,927 million, up $1.0 billion or 13% from $7,927 million in fiscal 2020. This increase was driven by revenue growth across all of the Bank's business segments. In fiscal 2020, total revenues had included a $24 million foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries. The fiscal 2021 total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items grew $900 million or 11% year over year. For additional information about total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis, see Table 2 on page 116.\n\n## Net Interest Income\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank's net interest income totalled $4,783 million, rising $528 million or 12% from $4,255 million in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2021 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totalled $4,964 million compared to $4,463 million in fiscal 2020 (Table 3, page 116).\n\nIn the Personal and Commercial segment, the fiscal 2021 net interest income totalled $2,583 million, a $138 million or 6% increase driven mainly by growth in loans and deposits, which rose 9% and 14%, respectively, year over year. The growth in loans came mainly from mortgage credit and loans to businesses. The increase in the Personal and Commercial segment's net interest income was tempered by a lower net interest margin, which was 2.12% in fiscal 2021 versus 2.19% in fiscal 2020, as lower interest rates notably affected deposit margins. In the Wealth Management segment, the fiscal 2021 net interest income totalled $448 million, a 1% year-over-year increase owing to growth in loan volumes, tempered by a lower deposit margin.\n\nIn the Financial Markets segment, the fiscal 2021 net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was up $280 million or 30% year over year, mainly due to trading activities, and should be examined together with the other items of trading activity revenues. In the USSF&I segment, the fiscal 2021 net interest income was up $100 million or 12% year over year, owing to growth in loan and deposit volumes at the Advanced Bank of Asia Limited (ABA Bank) subsidiary and to higher net interest income at the Credigy subsidiary given growth in loan portfolios and good performance in certain portfolios.\n\n## Non-Interest Income\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank's non-interest income totalled $4,144 million versus $3,672 million in fiscal 2020. The fiscal 2020 non-interest income had included a $24 million foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries. The Bank's non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and excluding specified items amounted to $4,152 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $3,753 million in fiscal 2020. For additional information on non-interest income on a taxable equivalent basis, see Table 4 on page 117.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, revenues from underwriting and advisory fees rose 32% year over year, notably due to capital markets activities and merger and acquisition activities in the Financial Markets segment. Revenues from securities brokerage commissions rose 17% year over year given growth in transaction volume during fiscal 2021. Combined, mutual fund revenues and revenues from investment management and trust service fees totalled $1,463 million in fiscal 2021, a $251 million year-over-year increase owing to growth in assets under administration and under management as a result of net inflows into various solutions and of stronger stock market performance in fiscal 2021.\n\nRevenues from credit fees and revenues from acceptances and letters of credit and guarantee grew $39 million compared to fiscal 2020 due to greater credit activity in Commercial Banking and the Financial Markets segment. Also during fiscal 2021, card revenues and revenues from deposits and payment service charges rose 7% and 5%, respectively, as economic activity gradually rebounded and produced greater transaction volume in fiscal 2021, i.e., volume that had fallen in 2020 given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain sectors of the economy and on consumer spending habits.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Trading revenues recorded in non-interest income amounted to $268 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $544 million in fiscal 2020. Trading revenues on a taxable equivalent basis (1) recorded in non-interest income amounted to $276 million in fiscal 2021, down from $601 million in fiscal 2020. Including the portion recorded in net interest income, trading activity revenues on a taxable equivalent basis (1) amounted to $1,238 million in fiscal 2021, a $168 million year-over-year decrease (Table 5, page 117) attributable to decreases in revenues from equity securities and fixed-income securities as well as in revenues from commodities and foreign exchange activities of the Financial Markets segment. The trading activity revenues on a taxable equivalent basis of the other segments also decreased year over year.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, gains on non-trading securities rose $58 million year over year, mainly due to Treasury activities. The fiscal 2021 foreign exchange revenues and insurance revenues rose $38 million and $3 million, respectively, year over year. The share in the net income of associates and joint ventures was down $5 million. Other non-interest income amounted to $325 million in fiscal 2021, a $207 million increase that was mainly due to a gain realized on the disposal of certain loan portfolios in fiscal 2021 as well as to favourable impacts of a fair value remeasurement of certain Credigy loan portfolios, of gains on investments, and of a $33 million gain on a remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Flinks. These favourable factors were tempered by a $30 million loss related to a fair value measurement of the Bank's equity interest in AfrAsia Bank Limited (AfrAsia). In fiscal 2020, other revenues had also included a $24 million foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries.\n\n## NNoonn--IInntteerreesstt  EExxppeennsseess\n\nFor fiscal 2021, non-interest expenses stood at $4,853 million, up $308 million from fiscal 2020 (Table 6, page 118). These 2021 non-interest expenses included $9 million in impairment losses on intangible assets. In fiscal 2020, non-interest expenses had included $71 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $48 million in severance pay, and a $13 million charge related to Maple. The fiscal 2021 non-interest expenses excluding specified items stood at $4,844 million, up $431 million or 10% year over year.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, compensation and employee benefits stood at $3,027 million, a 12% year-over-year increase that was essentially attributable to higher variable  compensation  associated  with  revenue  growth.  An  increase  in  technology  expenses,  including  amortization,  came  from  significant  technology investments made by the Bank for its transformation plan and for business development purposes. These increases were tempered, however, by decreases in certain variable expenses, in particular the compensatory tax on salaries, as well as in the expenses incurred by the Bank to take measures in response to COVID-19.\n\n## P Prroovviissiioonnss  ffoorr  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank recorded $2 million in provisions for credit losses compared to $846 million in fiscal 2020 (Table 7, page 119). This $844 million decrease was due to lower provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans owing to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and in credit conditions in fiscal 2021, as opposed to the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook caused by COVID-19 in fiscal 2020. This decrease was also due to provisions for credit losses recorded on Personal Banking impaired loans (including credit card receivables) that were below pre-pandemic levels, in particular due  to  fewer  cases  of  insolvency,  a  reduction  in  client  spending  in  the  context  of  the  pandemic,  and  various  assistance  measures  implemented  by governments. Provisions for credit losses on impaired loans in Commercial Banking and in the USSF&I segment, essentially the Credigy subsidiary, were down $78 million and $52 million, respectively, during fiscal 2021. In the Financial Markets segment, the fiscal 2021 provisions for credit losses on impaired loans were up $7 million year over year. At $183 million, the fiscal 2021 provisions for credit losses on impaired loans (excluding POCI loans) represented 0.11% of average loans and acceptances, down from 0.23% in fiscal 2020 given a sharp decline in credit loss provisions on impaired loans in fiscal 2021.\n\n## I Innccoommee  TTaaxxeess\n\nDetailed information about the Bank's income taxes is provided in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements. For fiscal 2021, income taxes stood at $895 million, representing an effective tax rate of 22% compared to $453 million and an effective tax rate of 18% in fiscal 2020. This change in the effective tax rate stems from a higher level and proportion of tax-exempt dividend income in fiscal 2020 as well as from a decrease in the income tax rate applicable to the ABA Bank subsidiary in 2020 due to tax incentive measures granted by the Cambodian government.\n\n- (1) For additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Overall, the Canadian labour market has bounced back well from the pandemic, although certain sectors hit particularly hard by the crisis are still lagging. A labour shortage, resulting in higher employee wages, should spur businesses to intensify capital investments given their solid balance sheets. Bolstered by generous government assistance programs, households and businesses have avoided the worst of the crisis, with insolvencies posting historically low levels. Some households even managed to take advantage of the crisis to put their finances in order. They now find themselves with a considerable surplus of savings that are ready to fuel the economy. Given a robust global economic recovery in 2021 combined with numerous global supply chain issues exacerbated by strong demand, inflation has risen to levels not seen in many years. As a result, market interest rates are on the rise and a Bank of Canada response on the policy rate is expected in the first half of 2022. A normalization of the monetary policy should cool the residential real estate market, which has seen sharp price growth due to strong demand and limited supply.\n\nThe economic environment in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.\n\n## K Keeyy  SSuucccceessss  FFaaccttoorrss\n\n- \uf0b7 Strong penetration in our core Quebec market thanks to a full range of personal and commercial banking services.\n- \uf0b7 Well-established and enduring client relationships grounded in an ability to provide both advice and a full range of solutions tailored to specific client needs.\n- \uf0b7 Vast sales force in Quebec, consisting of both generalists and specialists, positioning the Bank to offer the best advice to clients.\n- \uf0b7 Unmatched closeness to Quebec entrepreneurs, with leading expertise in business lending and risk management solutions.\n- \uf0b7 Recognized expertise in specialized industries across Canada.\n- \uf0b7 Ability to meet all the needs facing businesses and entrepreneurs in collaboration with other Bank segments.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The  segment's  income  before  provisions  for  credit  losses  and  income  taxes  totalled $1,728 million in fiscal 2021, up 10% year over year. The growth in total revenues was driven by a $138 million increase in net interest income and a $91 million increase in non-interest income. The increase in net interest income came mainly from growth in personal and commercial loans and deposits, tempered, however by a net interest margin that decreased to 2.12% in fiscal 2021 from 2.19% in fiscal 2020, mainly due to deposit margins and, to a lesser extent, loan margins.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, Personal and Commercial's non-interest expenses stood at $1,958 million, a 3% year-over-year increase that was mainly attributable to increases in operations support charges and amortization expense as well as to higher compensation and employee benefits. These increases were  partly  offset  by  a  decrease  in  certain  variable  expenses.  At  53.1%,  the  segment's  2021 efficiency ratio improved by 1.6 percentage points from 54.7% in 2020.\n\nFor  fiscal  2021,  Personal  and  Commercial  recorded  $6  million  in  provisions  for  credit  losses, $511 million less than the $517 million recorded in fiscal 2020. This decrease stems from reversals of allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans given a more favourable macroeconomic outlook and improved credit conditions in fiscal 2021, as substantially higher provisions for credit losses had been recorded in fiscal 2020 to reflect a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook caused by COVID-19. In addition, the provisions for credit losses on Personal Banking impaired loans and on Commercial Banking impaired loans as well as on impaired credit card receivables were below pre-pandemic levels, in particular due to fewer cases of insolvency and to the various assistance measures deployed by governments.\n\n## P Peerrssoonnaall  BBaannkkiinngg\n\nFor  fiscal  2021,  Personal  Banking's  total  revenues  amounted  to  $2,228  million,  up  4%  from $2,148 million in fiscal 2020. An 8% increase in loan volumes and 9% growth in deposit volumes were tempered by a lower net interest margin on loans and deposits. Non-interest income grew $43 million, essentially due to insurance revenues, to internal commission revenues related to the distribution of Wealth Management products, and to credit card revenues. Non-interest expenses rose $44 million in fiscal 2021, mainly due to higher operations support charges and to an increase in technology investment expenses.\n\n## C Coommmmeerrcciiaall  BBaannkkiinngg\n\nFor fiscal 2021, Commercial Banking's total revenues amounted to $1,458 million, rising 11% from $1,309 million in fiscal 2020. Its net interest income was up year over year, essentially due to growth in loans and deposits, which rose 10% and 20%, respectively, tempered by a narrowing of the net interest margin on loans and deposits. Non-interest income was also up, rising $48 million compared to fiscal 2020, mainly due to increases in bankers' acceptance revenues, in revenues from derivative financial instruments, as well as in credit fee revenues. Non-interest expenses rose $22  million,  mainly  due  to  higher  compensation  and  employee  benefits  as  well  as  to  higher operations support charges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Governments vigorously supported households and businesses in difficulty. Central banks lowered interest rates to nearly zero and rolled out aggressive stimulus programs. With these interventions-unprecedented in scope-a robust economic recovery has emerged and the stress on financial markets has swiftly eased and remains in check. As a result, business profits have rebounded sharply and risk assets have benefitted from extremely accommodating interest rates. Households have experienced an unprecedented wealth effect since the start of the pandemic, not only because of the strong financial market performance but also because of the rise in housing prices. Overall, the current environment remains poised for relatively robust economic growth again in 2022. Still, a normalization of interest rates in the high inflationary context could produce a resurgence in market volatility.\n\nThe economic environment in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The segment's total revenues amounted to $2,169 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $1,859 million in fiscal 2020, a 17% increase owing in part to a 21% increase in fee-based revenues given growth in average assets under administration and average assets under management  generated  by  net  inflows  into  various  solutions  and  by  stronger  stock  market performance in fiscal 2021. Transaction-based and other revenues were also up, rising 23% due to growth in transaction volume driven by stronger stock market performance in fiscal 2021. The segment's net interest income increased slightly, rising 1%, as growth in loan volume was tempered by a lower deposit margin.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, Wealth Management's non-interest expenses stood at $1,277 million compared to $1,125  million  in  fiscal  2020,  an  increase  attributable  to  higher  compensation  and  employee benefits, notably the variable compensation associated with revenue growth, as well as to higher external  management  fees  and  operations  support  charges  related  to  the  segment's  business growth and initiatives. At 58.9%, the segment's 2021 efficiency ratio improved by 1.6 percentage points from 60.5% in 2020.\n\nWealth Management recorded $1 million in provisions for credit losses for fiscal 2021, whereas $7 million had been recorded in fiscal 2020 to reflect a deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook caused by COVID-19.\n\n## A Asssseettss  UUnnddeerr  AAddmmiinniissttrraattiioonn  aanndd  AAsssseettss  UUnnddeerr  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, assets under administration totalled $651.5 billion, rising $142.5 billion since  October  31,  2020.  This  increase  came  from  net  inflows  into  various  solutions  and  from stronger stock market performance in fiscal 2021.\n\nIn the individual category, assets under management amounted to $64.9 billion as at October 31, 2021 compared to $48.1 billion as at October 31, 2020.

Households were supported during the various waves of infection and are well positioned to contribute to the economic recovery. The rebound in Canada's labour market is at a point where households are able to support growth even as government assistance programs end. This context helped drive business profitability, which has been beneficial to hiring and investment growth. The stress on the financial markets was short-lived at the start of the pandemic and has subsequently remained in check. Financial conditions have, therefore, been extremely accommodating thanks to the actions taken by central banks and the solid performance posted by risk asset classes in recent months. However, a resurgence in volatility must not be discounted as the central banks move forward with an interest rate normalization process in a context where the supply chain is strained. Moreover, the pandemic could still hold some unwelcome surprises, as seen by the rise of the Delta variant, which resulted in strong outbreaks of COVID-19.\n\nThe economic environment in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.\n\n## K Keeyy  SSuucccceessss  FFaaccttoorrss\n\n- \uf0b7 Pan-Canadian  franchise  with  established  leadership  in  government  debt  underwriting,  ETF  market-making,  and  securities  lending  and  recognized capabilities in risk management solutions, structured products, and equity derivatives.\n- \uf0b7 Focused on client relationships and diversified client activity and revenue mix.\n- \uf0b7 Sound risk management.\n- \uf0b7 Flexible approach to capital allocation and proven ability to adapt to evolving capital market conditions and to deliver consistent financial performance.\n- \uf0b7 Entrepreneurial culture: Integrated approach, teamwork, and alignment among all groups, including other segments of the Bank.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The segment's income before provisions for credit losses and income taxes on a taxable equivalent basis totalled $1,266 million in fiscal 2021, up $24 million or 2% from fiscal 2020. Its fiscal 2021 total revenues on a taxable equivalent basis amounted to $2,146 million, up $92 million or 4% from $2,054 million in fiscal 2020. Global markets revenues declined 8% given decreases across all types of revenues, which had benefitted from a favourable context in fiscal 2020. For fiscal 2021, the segment's corporate and investment banking revenues grew 24% year over year, mainly due to increases in revenues from capital markets activities, in revenues from merger and acquisition activities, and in banking service revenues.\n\nThe  segment's  fiscal  2021  non-interest  expenses  posted  a  year-over-year  increase  of  8%, essentially due to higher compensation and employee benefits, notably the variable compensation associated  with  revenue  growth,  as  well  as  to  higher  technology  investment  expenses  and operations support charges. The segment's fiscal 2021 efficiency ratio on a taxable equivalent basis was 41.0% versus 39.5% in fiscal 2020.\n\nFinancial Markets recorded $10 million in provisions for credit losses for fiscal 2021 compared to $239  million  in  fiscal  2020.  This  decrease  was  due  to  reversals  of  credit  loss  provisions  on non-impaired loans in fiscal 2021 given improved macroeconomic outlook and credit conditions, as opposed to the substantial credit loss provisions recorded in fiscal 2020 to reflect a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook caused by COVID-19. For fiscal 2021, the provisions for credit losses on impaired loans were up $7 million year over year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Global markets (2020: 62%)\n- Corporate and investment banking (2020: 38%)\n\n## O Oppeerraattiinngg  RReessuullttss\n\nYear ended October 31 (taxable equivalent basis) (1) (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Total revenues\n- Non-interest expenses\n- Net income\n- (1) For additional information on non-GAAP financial measures, see the Financial Reporting Method section on pages 18 to 21.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank is currently focused on specialty finance in the U.S. through Credigy and on personal and commercial banking in Cambodia through ABA Bank. The Bank also holds minority positions in financial groups operating in French-speaking Africa and Africa-Asia. The Bank currently has a moratorium on any new significant investments in emerging markets. During fiscal 2021, the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment generated 11% of the Bank's consolidated total revenue and 17% of its net income.\n\n## U U..SS..

The consumer services sector continues to gradually recover while the consumer goods sector is slowing after hitting record highs. However, this slowdown is partly due to the supply chain bottlenecks that are hobbling certain industries, in particular the automotive sector. We expect these issues to fade in 2022 such that demand bounces back. The job market recovery has disappointed in recent months given a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the job market is still posting a labour shortage of almost 4 million workers compared with its pre-pandemic level. We will, however, continue to anticipate additional progress in the coming months amid a backdrop where there are currently acute labour shortages in light of numerous economic indicators. Such progress, combined with the improved financial position of households, suggests another year of robust growth next year, driven mainly by consumption. In addition to having a considerable surplus of savings, households have experienced an unprecedented wealth effect from the onset of the pandemic, not only because of the strong financial market performance but also because of the rise in housing prices. The real estate market has cooled off after a very strong upsurge, with activity remaining strong on a historical basis. Despite an inflation level not seen in 30 years, the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to favour a very accommodative policy, which should continue over several more quarters in anticipation of the labour market returning to its pre-pandemic level.\n\nThe economic environment in 2021 and the outlook for 2022 are discussed in more detail in the Economic Review and Outlook section on page 26.\n\n## K Keeyy  SSuucccceessss  FFaaccttoorrss\n\n- \uf0b7 Ability to seize opportunities in response to rapidly changing market conditions through a disciplined yet adaptable investment strategy.\n- \uf0b7 Diversification across several classes of performing assets.\n- \uf0b7 Market credibility achieved through over 330 transactions life-to-date, representing over US$19 billion in total investments.\n- \uf0b7 Rigorous underwriting approach strengthened by a continuous refinement of modelling and analytics capabilities as well as expertise in specific asset classes.\n- \uf0b7 Proven expertise in the successful management and servicing of consumer assets.\n- \uf0b7 Resilience to economic downturns achieved through limited exposure to unsecured assets, due to investments with high credit profiles and structural enhancements that provide downside protection.\n\n## O Obbjjeeccttiivveess  aanndd  SSttrraatteeggiieess\n\nCredigy aims to provide customized solutions for the acquisition or financing of assets related to consumer receivables in pursuit of the best risk-adjusted returns and a return on assets (ROA) of at least 2.5%.\n\n| Strategic Priorities                                                                                                                | 2021 Achievements and Highlights                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sustain deal flow by being a partner  of choice for bank and non-bank institutions facing complex  challenges and strategic changes | \uf03e \uf03e Conducted active monitoring of the economy and opportunities.  \uf03e\uf03e Achieved a balance in transactions among new and existing partners.  \uf03e\uf03e Maintained average assets of approximately $7.5 billion.                  |\n| Maintain a diversified mix of  performing assets                                                                                    | \uf03e \uf03e Performing assets accounted for 98% of assets.  \uf03e\uf03e Continued asset class diversification focused on secured high-quality consumer assets.  \uf03e\uf03e Leveraged flexibility to invest via financing and direct acquisition. |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

An  effective  vaccination  campaign  (78%  of  the population vaccinated as of October 2021) played a favourable role in removing the restrictions on foreign visitors announced since October 2021. After a 3% contraction in 2020, the economy is expected to grow by 2% in 2021. In 2022, growth rates should progress further towards historical growth rates of 7%, as global consumption and tourism return to more normalized levels. Cambodia will also continue to benefit from increased regional economic integration under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) trade association.

The  segment's  fiscal  2021  total  revenues  amounted  to  $1,001  million  versus $820 million in fiscal 2020, a 22% increase driven mainly by higher revenues at the ABA Bank subsidiary,  which  rose  $100  million  owing  to  loan  and  deposit  growth,  as  well  as  by  higher revenues at the Credigy subsidiary, which rose $80 million following a disposal of loan portfolios and fair value remeasurements of certain loan portfolios.\n\nThe segment's non-interest expenses stood at $315 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $319 million in fiscal 2020, a $4 million decrease attributable to a decline in Credigy's non-interest expenses given lower service charges.\n\nProvisions for credit losses were down $95 million compared to fiscal 2020, resulting in part from a more favourable macroeconomic outlook as well as from a remeasurement of POCI loan portfolios at Credigy.\n\n## C Crreeddiiggyy\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Credigy subsidiary's net income, as reported in the USSF&I segment, totalled $302 million, up 89% from fiscal 2020. The subsidiary's fiscal 2021 total revenues amounted to $486 million, up from $406 million in fiscal 2020. Growth in loan portfolios and strong performance in certain portfolios led to higher net interest income, while an increase in non-interest income came from a $26 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2021 following a disposal of loan portfolios, from a favourable impact of remeasuring certain loan portfolios at fair value, and from sound performance by certain loan portfolios in fiscal 2021, whereas the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic had had an unfavourable impact on the performance of these same portfolios in fiscal 2020. Credigy's non-interest expenses were down $5 million year over year given a decrease in service charges, partly offset by an increase in variable compensation. Credigy's provisions for credit  losses  were  down  $100 million  year  over  year,  resulting  in  part  from  a  more  favourable macroeconomic outlook, a remeasurement of POCI loan portfolios, and a decrease in provisions for credit losses on impaired loans.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Bank acquired the entire remaining non-controlling interest in the Credigy subsidiary. For additional information, see Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## A ABBAA  BBaannkk\n\nFor fiscal 2021, ABA Bank's net income totalled $251 million, up 31% from fiscal 2020. Growth in the subsidiary's business activities, mainly in the form of sustained loan and deposit growth, drove total revenues up 24% year over year. However, this growth was tempered by lower interest rates and by exchange rate movement. At $173 million, ABA Bank's non-interest expenses remained relatively  stable  compared  with  fiscal  2020,  as  higher  variable  compensation  was  offset  by exchange rate movement. The subsidiary recorded $26 million in provisions for credit losses in fiscal 2021, up $5 million year over year, as provisions for credit losses on non-impaired loans rose, essentially due to an anticipated impact on clients from an increase in COVID-19 cases in fiscal 2021.\n\nThe subsidiary's fiscal 2021 effective tax rate increased, mainly due to tax incentive measures granted by the Cambodian government and recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Credigy (2020: 50%)\n- ABA Bank (2020: 50%)\n\n## O Oppeerraattiinngg RReessuullttss\n\nYear ended October 31 (millions of Canadian dollars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2\n\n2002211\n\n- Credigy\n- ABA Bank and International\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This change in net loss was mainly due to gains on investments, a $33 million gain on remeasurement of the previously held equity interest in Flinks, and a decrease in the expenses incurred by the Bank to protect the health and safety of employees and clients in response to COVID-19, which were higher in fiscal 2020. These items were partly offset by a loss of $30 million ($26 million net of income taxes) on a fair value remeasurement of the Bank's equity interest in AfrAsia, as well as by an increase in variable compensation associated with revenue growth. In fiscal 2021, the specified items had an unfavourable impact of $7 million on the Other heading's net income compared with an unfavourable impact of $133 million in fiscal 2020. Revenues from Treasury activities were lower in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, partly due to the market volatility experienced in fiscal 2020.\n\nThe specified items, net of income taxes, recorded in fiscal 2021 consisted of a $7 million impairment loss on intangible assets. The specified items, net of income taxes, recorded in fiscal 2020 had included a $36 million foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of Credigy subsidiaries in Brazil, $52 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, $35 million in severance pay, and a $10 million charge related to Maple. For fiscal 2021, net loss excluding specified items stood at $215 million compared to a $179 million net loss in fiscal 2020.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

In fiscal 2021, net income posted year-over-year growth in every quarter. This significant growth came from the net income increases generated in each business segment, notably driven by higher revenues and by lower provisions for credit losses given an improved macroeconomic outlook in fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, the Bank recorded $7 million in impairment losses (net of income taxes) on intangible assets, whereas, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Bank had recorded a foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries, impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets, and severance pay, all of which combined had a $133 million unfavourable impact on net income.\n\nNet interest income posted year-over-year increases for every quarter of fiscal 2021. These increases were mainly driven by personal and commercial loan and deposit growth, by trading activity revenues in the Financial Markets segment, by loan portfolio growth at the Credigy subsidiary, and by increases in the net interest income of the ABA Bank subsidiary owing to sustained business growth. In the Wealth Management segment, the fiscal 2021 net interest income posted year-over-year growth in every quarter except the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as deposit margins narrowed due to lower interest rates, partly offset by growth in loan volume.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, non-interest income posted year-over-year increases in every quarter. These increases were driven by sustained business growth across all the business segments except for Financial Markets, which saw non-interest income decline due to trading activity revenues. In the Wealth Management segment, non-interest income grew substantially in every quarter of fiscal 2021 given growth in average assets under administration and under management as a result of net inflows into various solutions and of stronger stock market performance in fiscal 2021. In the USSF&I segment, non-interest income included a gain on the disposal of loan portfolios in the first quarter of 2021. And in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, non-interest income had included a foreign currency translation loss on a disposal of subsidiaries.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, non-interest expenses posted year-over-year increases in every quarter except the fourth quarter, wherein it remained stable. The increases were attributable to compensation and employee benefits and to technology investment expenses incurred as part of the Bank's transformation plan and for business development. These increases were tempered, however, by decreases in certain expenses, in particular the compensatory tax on salaries and the expenses incurred by the Bank to implement health and safety measures for employees and clients in response to COVID-19, which were higher in the corresponding quarters of fiscal 2020. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, non-interest expenses included $9 million in impairment losses on intangible assets, whereas, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, they had included $71 million in impairment losses on premises and equipment and on intangible assets and $48 million in severance pay. And in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, non-interest expenses had included a $13 million charge related to Maple.\n\nYear over year, the Bank's provisions for credit losses decreased in every quarter of fiscal 2021. These decreases were attributable to reversals of allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans, recorded as of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, to reflect improvements in the macroeconomic outlook and in credit conditions in fiscal 2021, as opposed to the substantial deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook caused by COVID-19 in fiscal 2020, especially in the second quarter of fiscal 2020, when the Bank recorded very high credit loss provisions on non-impaired loans. The decreases in provisions for credit losses were also due to lower credit loss provisions on impaired loans, essentially those in Personal and Commercial Banking and at the Credigy subsidiary. In addition, significant remeasurements of POCI loan portfolios at the Credigy subsidiary contributed to a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses in the third quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nThe change in the effective tax rates between the quarters of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 came essentially from a higher level and proportion of tax-exempt dividend income in every quarter of fiscal 2020. In addition, a lower effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2020 was attributable to a lower tax rate at the ABA Bank subsidiary given tax incentives granted by the Cambodian government.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This growth in residential mortgages was driven by sustained demand for mortgage credit. As for personal loans, they totalled $16.5 billion as at October 31, 2021. With respect to commercial loans, there was year-over-year growth in the agriculture, utilities, finance and insurance, real estate and real-estate-construction, and other services categories. As at October 31, 2021, certain categories posted year-over-year decreases, notably the oil and gas and pipelines category. Furthermore, the Credigy subsidiary's POCI loans decreased since October 31, 2020 as a result of repayments and maturities of certain portfolios.\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                                                           | 2 2002211       | 2020    | % %  cchhaannggee   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|---------------------|\n| A Asssseettss                                                                            |                 |         |                     |\n| Cash and deposits with financial institutions                                            | 3 333,,887799   | 29,142  | 1 166               |\n| Securities                                                                               | 1 10066,,330044 | 102,131 | 4 4                 |\n| Securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed         | 7 7,,551166     | 14,512  | ( (4488))           |\n| Loans and acceptances, net of allowances                                                 | 1 18822,,668899 | 164,740 | 1 111               |\n| Other                                                                                    | 2 255,,440077   | 21,100  | 2 200               |\n|                                                                                          | 3 35555,,779955 | 331,625 | 7 7                 |\n| L Liiaabbiilliittiieess  aanndd  eeqquuiittyy                                            |                 |         |                     |\n| Deposits                                                                                 | 2 24400,,993388 | 215,878 | 1 122               |\n| Other                                                                                    | 9 955,,223333   | 98,589  | ( (33))             |\n| Subordinated debt                                                                        | 7 76688         | 775     | ( (11))             |\n| Equity attributable to the Bank ' s shareholders and holders of other equity instruments | 1 188,,885533   | 16,380  | 1 155               |\n| Non-controlling interests                                                                | 3 3             | 3       | - -                 |\n|                                                                                          | 3 35555,,779955 | 331,625 | 7 7                 |\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the Bank had total assets of $355.8 billion, rising $24.2 billion or 7% from $331.6 billion since year-end 2020.\n\n## C Caasshh  aanndd  DDeeppoossiittss  WWiitthh  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttiittuuttiioonnss\n\nAt $33.9 billion as at October 31, 2021, cash and deposits with financial institutions rose $4.8 billion since October 31, 2020, mainly due to greater deposits with the Bank of Canada and the U.S. Federal Reserve. The high level of cash and deposits with financial institutions came partly from the liquidity obtained as part of financing initiatives deployed by the Canadian government in 2020, through the Bank of Canada, to support the Canadian financial system in response to COVID-19. The Bank's liquidity and funding risk management practices are described on pages 94 to 103 of this MD&A.\n\n## S Seeccuurriittiieess\n\nSince October 31, 2020, securities rose $4.2 billion due to a $6.5 billion or 8% increase in securities at fair value through profit or loss, particularly equity securities, tempered by a $2.3 billion decrease in securities other than those measured at fair value through profit or loss.

This growth was driven mainly by sustained demand for mortgage credit in the Personal and Commercial segment.

(Flinks), a leading fintech company specialized in financial data aggregation and distribution, in which the Bank had already been holding a 30.2% equity interest. Flinks provides services to a wide North American fintech ecosystem and offers  attractive  data  technology  solutions.  The  acquisition  strategically  positions  the  Bank  in  a  high-growth  market  to  continue  to  enhance  customer experiences and benefit from future technology-driven innovations. At the time of acquisition, the amount of which was $73 million in cash for voting preferred shares, the Bank was holding an 82.9% equity interest in Flinks, thereby giving it control thereover. Immediately after the acquisition, the Bank made an additional $30 million investment in voting right preferred shares, giving the Bank an 85.9% equity interest in Flinks. The amount of the $73 million purchase price, of the fair value of the previously held equity interest, and of the estimated value of the non-controlling interest established on the acquisition date, exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $101 million. This excess amount has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill and mainly represents the expected future profits of Flinks given its favourable position in this growth market. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The previously held equity interest, accounted for as an associate, was remeasured at fair value, generating a $33 million non-taxable remeasurement gain that was reported in the Non-interest income - Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## A Accqquuiissiittiioonn  ooff  tthhee  EEnnttiirree  RReemmaaiinniinngg  NNoonn--CCoonnttrroolllliinngg  IInntteerreesstt  iinn  tthhee  CCrreeddiiggyy  LLttdd..

Under the first program, the Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgage loans and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT), which finances the purchase through the issuance of mortgage bonds insured by CMHC. Moreover, these mortgage bonds feature an interest rate swap agreement under which a CMHC-certified counterparty pays CHT the interest due to investors and receives the interest on the NHA securities. As at October 31, 2021, the outstanding amount of NHA securities issued by the Bank and sold to CHT was $22.4 billion. The mortgage loans sold consist of fixed- or variable-rate residential loans that are insured against potential losses by a loan insurer. In accordance with the NHA-MBS Program, the Bank advances the funds required to cover late payments and, if necessary, obtains reimbursement from the insurer that insured the loan. The NHA-MBS and CMB programs do not use liquidity guarantee arrangements. The Bank uses these securitization programs mainly to diversify its funding sources. In accordance with IFRS, because the Bank retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the mortgage loans transferred to CHT, the derecognition criteria are not met. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans securitized under the CMB Program continue to be recognized in Loans on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the liabilities for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Credit Card Receivables\n\nIn April 2015, the Bank set up Canadian Credit Card Trust II (CCCT II) to continue its program of securitizing credit card receivables on a revolving basis. The Bank uses this entity for capital management and funding purposes. The Bank acts as the servicer of the receivables sold and maintains the client relationship. Furthermore, it administers the securitization program and ensures that all related procedures are stringently followed and that investors are paid according to the provisions of the program.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the credit card receivables portfolio held by CCCT II (net of the Bank Certificate held by the Bank) represented an amount outstanding of $1.9 billion. CCCT II issued notes to investors, $0.1 billion of which is held by third parties and $1.8 billion is held by the Bank. New receivables are periodically sold to the structure on a revolving basis to replace the receivables reimbursed by clients.\n\nThe different series of notes are rated by the Fitch and DBRS rating agencies. From this portfolio of sold receivables, the Bank retains the excess spread, i.e., the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid, and thus provides first-loss protection. Furthermore, secondloss protection for issued series is provided by notes subordinated to the senior notes, representing 5.8% of the total amount of the series issued. The Bank controls CCCT II and thus consolidates it.\n\n## S Seeccuurriittiizzaattiioonn  ooff  TThhiirrdd--PPaarrttyy  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nThe Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the acquired assets.

Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The Bank acts as a financial agent and provides administrative and transaction structuring services to these conduits. The Bank provides backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Notes 26 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements.

This process aims to determine the capital that the Bank needs to pursue its business activities and accommodate unexpected losses arising from extremely adverse economic and operational conditions. The Bank has implemented a rigorous internal capital adequacy assessment process that comprises the following procedures:\n\n- \uf0b7 conducting an overall risk assessment;\n- \uf0b7 measuring significant risks and the capital requirements related to the Bank's financial budget for the next fiscal year and current and prospective risk profiles;\n- \uf0b7 integrating stress tests across the organization and executing sensitivity analyses to determine the capital buffer above minimum regulatory levels (for additional information on enterprise-wide stress testing, see the Risk Management section of this MD&A);\n- \uf0b7 aggregating capital and monitoring the reasonableness of internal capital compared with regulatory capital;\n- \uf0b7 comparing projected internal capital with regulatory capital levels, internal operating targets, and competing banks;\n- \uf0b7 attesting to the adequacy of the Bank's capital levels.\n\nAssessing capital adequacy is an integral part of capital planning and strategy. The Bank sets internal capital ratio targets that include a discretionary cushion in excess of the regulatory requirements, which provides a solid financial structure and sufficient capital to meet management's business needs in accordance with its risk appetite, along with competitive returns to shareholders, under both normal market conditions and a range of severe but plausible stress testing scenarios. The internal capital adequacy assessment process is a key tool in establishing the Bank's capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments.\n\nRisk-adjusted return on capital and shareholder value added (SVA), which are obtained from an assessment of required economic capital, are calculated quarterly for each of the Bank's business segments. The results are then used to guide management in allocating capital among the various business segments.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurree  aanndd  GGoovveerrnnaannccee\n\nAlong with its partners from Risk Management, Global Funding and Treasury Group, and Finance, the Capital Management team is responsible for maintaining integrated control methods and processes so that an overall assessment of capital adequacy may be performed.\n\nThe Board oversees the structure and development of the Bank's capital management policy and ensures that the Bank maintains sufficient capital in accordance with regulatory requirements and in consideration of market conditions. The Board delegates certain responsibilities to the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which in turn recommends capital management policies and oversees their application. However, the Board, on the recommendation of the RMC, assumes the following responsibilities:\n\n- \uf0b7 reviewing and approving the capital management policy;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing and approving the Bank's risk appetite, including the main capital and risk targets and the corresponding limits;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing and approving the capital plan and strategy on an annual basis, including the Bank's internal capital adequacy assessment process;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing and approving the implementation of significant measures respecting capital, including contingency measures;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing significant capital disclosures, including Basel capital adequacy ratios;\n- \uf0b7 ensuring the appropriateness of the regulatory capital adequacy assessment.\n\nThe Office of the President is responsible for defining the Bank's strategy and plays a key role in guiding measures and decisions regarding capital.

A less complex approach, such as the Standardized Approach, uses regulatory weightings, while a more complex approach uses the Bank's internal estimates of risk components to establish risk-weighted assets and calculate regulatory capital.\n\nAs required under Basel, risk-weighted assets (RWA) are calculated for each credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. The Bank uses the Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) Approach for credit risk to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for a majority of its portfolios. The credit risk of certain portfolios considered to be less significant is weighted according to the Basel Standardized Approach. The simple risk-weighted method is used to calculate the charge related to banking book equity securities. This method requires proactive management of the capital allocated to portfolios with banking book equity securities, since, beyond a certain investment threshold, the cost of regulatory capital becomes prohibitive. As for operational risk, the Bank uses the Standardized Approach. Market risk-weighted assets are primarily determined using the Internal Model-Based Approach, while the Standardized Approach is used to assess interest-rate specific risk.\n\nWith respect to the risk related to securitization operations, the capital treatment depends on the type of underlying exposures and on the information available about the exposures. The Bank must use the Securitization: Internal Rating-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) if it is able to apply an approved internal ratings-based model and has sufficient information to calculate the capital requirements for all underlying exposures in the securitization pool. Under this approach, the RWA is derived from a combination of supervisory inputs and inputs specific to the securitization exposure, such as the implicit capital charge related to the underlying exposures, the credit enhancement level, the effective maturity, the number of exposures, and the weighted average loss given default (LGD).\n\nIf the Bank cannot use the SEC-IRBA, it must use the Securitization: External Rating-Based Approach (SEC-ERBA) for the securitization exposures that are externally  rated.  This  approach  assigns  risk  weights  to  exposures  using  external  ratings.  The  Bank  uses  the  ratings  assigned  by  Moody's, Standard & Poor's (S&P), Fitch, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, or DBRS or a combination of these ratings. The Bank uses the Securitization: Internal Assessment Approach  (SEC-IAA)  for  unrated  securitization  exposures  relating  to  the  asset-backed  commercial  paper  conduits  it  sponsors.  The  SEC-IAA  rating methodologies used are mainly based on criteria published by the above-mentioned credit rating agencies and consider risks factors that the Bank deems relevant to assessing the credit quality of the exposures. The Bank's SEC-IAA includes an assessment of the extent by which the credit enhancement available for loss protection provides coverage of expected losses. The levels of stressed coverage the Bank requires for each internal risk rating are consistent with the requirements published by the rating agencies for equivalent external ratings by asset class. If the Bank cannot apply the SEC-ERBA or the SEC-IAA, it must use the  supervisory  formula  under  the  Securitization  Standardized  Approach  (SEC-SA).  Under  this  approach,  RWA  is  derived  from  inputs  specific  to  the securitization exposure, such as the implicit capital charge related to the underlying exposures calculated under the standardized credit risk approach as well as credit enhancement and delinquency levels.\n\nIf none of the above approaches can be used, the securitization exposure must be assigned a risk weight of 1,250%. The Bank can apply a reduced capital charge for securitization exposures that meet the criteria of the Simple, Transparent and Comparable (STC) framework.\n\nCapital ratios are calculated by dividing capital by risk-weighted assets. Credit, market, and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets calculation for regulatory purposes. Basel rules apply at the consolidated level of the Bank. Assets of non-consolidated entities for regulatory purposes are therefore excluded from the risk-weighted assets calculation.\n\nThe definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders' equity less goodwill, intangible assets, and other CET1 capital deductions. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital consists of eligible non-cumulative preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes (LRCN), and other AT1 capital adjustments. The sum of CET1 and AT1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of eligible subordinated debts and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

As at October 31, 2021, the Bank has one remaining non-NVCC Tier 2 subordinated debt capital instrument, which it expects to phase out without resorting to any regulatory event redemption clause. Furthermore, in the regulations of the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) Act and the Bank Act (Canada), the Government of Canada has provided detailed information on conversion, issuance, and compensation regimes for bail-in instruments issued by D-SIBs (collectively the Bail-In Regulations). Pursuant to the CDIC Act, in circumstances where OSFI has determined that the Bank has ceased, or is about to cease, to be viable, the Governor in Council may, upon a Minister of Finance recommendation indicating that he or she believes that it is in the public interest to do so, grant an order directing CDIC to convert all or a portion of certain shares and liabilities of the Bank into common shares (a 'Bail-In Conversion').\n\nThe  Bail-In  Regulations  governing  the  conversion  and  issuance  of  bail-in  instruments  came  into  force  on  September  23,  2018,  and  those  governing compensation for holders of converted instruments came into force on March 27, 2018. Any shares and liabilities issued before the date that the Bail-In Regulations came into force are not subject to a Bail-In Conversion, unless, in the case of a liability, the terms of said liability are, on or after that day, amended to increase its principal amount or to extend its term to maturity, and the liability, as amended, meets the requirements to be subject to a Bail-In Conversion.\n\nThe Bail-In Regulations prescribe the types of shares and liabilities that are subject to a Bail-In Conversion. In general, any senior debt securities with an initial or amended term-to-maturity greater than 400 days that are unsecured or partially secured and have been assigned a Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP), an International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), or similar identification number are subject to a Bail-In Conversion. Shares, other than common shares, and subordinated debt, that are not NVCC instruments, are also subject to a Bail-In Conversion. However, certain other debt obligations of the Bank such as structured notes (as defined in the Bail-In Regulations), covered bonds, deposits and certain derivative financial instruments are not subject to a bail-in conversion.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, outstanding liabilities of $11.9 billion ($8.4 billion as at October 31, 2020) were subject to conversion under the Bail-In Regulations.\n\nThe Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 12.0%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 14.0%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% established by the BCBS and OSFI, a 1.0% surcharge applicable solely to D-SIBs, and a 2.5% domestic stability buffer established by OSFI. On June 17, 2021, OSFI raised the domestic stability buffer from 1.0% to 2.5% effective on October 31, 2021. The domestic stability buffer, which varies from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement is not subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but must provide a remediation plan to OSFI. The banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II Standardized approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 70% of the capital requirement as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to risk-weighted assets. OSFI requires Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative financial instruments exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total exposure.\n\nOSFI's Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guideline, which applies to all D-SIBs under the federal government's Bail-In Regulations, came into effect on September 23, 2018. The purpose of the TLAC guideline is to ensure that a D-SIB has sufficient loss-absorbing capacity to support its recapitalization in the unlikely event it becomes non-viable. OSFI is requiring D-SIBs to maintain a minimum risk-based TLAC ratio of 24.0% (including the domestic stability buffer) of risk-weighted assets and a minimum TLAC leverage ratio of 6.75% as of November 1, 2021. During the year ended October 31, 2019, the Bank had started to issue qualifying bail-in debt such that its TLAC ratios could improve through the normal refinancing of its maturing unsecured term debt. The Bank was in compliance with the TLAC requirements as of November 1, 2021.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

that its capital levels are always above the minimum capital requirements set by OSFI, including the domestic stability buffer. By maintaining a strong capital structure, the Bank can cover the risks inherent to its business activities, support its business segments, and protect its clients.\n\nOther disclosure requirements pursuant to Pillar 3 of the Basel Accord and a set of recommendations defined by the EDTF are presented in the Supplementary Regulatory Capital and Pillar 3 Disclosure report published quarterly and available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca. Furthermore, a complete list of capital instruments and their main features is also available on the Bank's website.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  CCoonntteexxtt\n\nThe Bank closely monitors regulatory developments and participates actively in various consultative processes. In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 27, 2020 OSFI announced a series of regulatory adjustments to support the financial and operational resilience of banks. The measures announced by OSFI that have continued to have an impact on the Bank for the year ended October 31, 2021 are described in the section entitled COVID-19 Pandemic - Key Measures Introduced by the Regulatory Authorities, which is on page 17 of this MD&A. Presented below are brief descriptions of ongoing regulatory projects.\n\n## Basel III Reform\n\nIn December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees the BCBS, endorsed the outstanding Basel III postcrisis regulatory reforms. The purpose of the approved reforms, set out in Basel III: Finalising Post-Crisis Reforms, is to reduce excessive variability in riskweighted assets and improve comparability and transparency among bank capital ratios.\n\nOn  March  27,  2020,  in  response  to  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  GHOS  announced  a  postponement  to  the  implementation  of  the  Basel III international capital standard reform. OSFI therefore postponed, until the first quarter of 2023, the implementation of the Standardized Approach and Advanced IRB Approach to credit risk, the revision of the operational risk framework and of the leverage ratio framework, and the introduction of a more risksensitive capital floor. Implementation of the Pillar 3 financial disclosure requirements finalized by the BCBS in December 2018 was also postponed until at least the first quarter of 2023. On November 29, 2021, OSFI postponed the implementation of the above-mentioned Basel III reform items to the second quarter of 2023. Lastly, implementation of the final set of revisions to the new market risk framework, entitled Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and published in January 2019, and implementation of the revised CVA risk framework are being postponed to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, OSFI launched an industry consultation on regulatory changes that introduce the latest and final series of Basel III reforms into the capital, leverage, and disclosure guidelines applicable to Canadian banks. OSFI's proposals align with the international standards set by the BCBS while also reflecting the realities of the Canadian market. On May 4, 2021, OSFI launched an industry consultation on the corresponding changes to the regulatory returns, namely, the  Basel Capital Adequacy Reporting (BCAR)  return  and  the  Leverage Requirements  (LR)  return.  Finally,  on  June  18,  2021,  OSFI  launched  an  industry consultation on proposed regulatory changes to the treatment of credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and market risk hedges of other valuation adjustments of over-the-counter derivatives referred to as XVA. The Bank is actively participating in these consultations.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Unwinding of Regulatory Adjustments and Other Projects\n\nOn March 16, 2021, OSFI announced the unwinding of the temporary reduction to stressed Value-at-Risk (VaR) multipliers under the market risk capital requirements for banks, returning them to the pre-pandemic level, i.e., a two-notch increase to the stressed VaR multiplier. The implementation date for this adjustment to the VaR multiplier was May 1, 2021.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the BCBS issued two final sets of principles addressing operational risk and operational resilience: Principles for Operational Resilience and Revisions to the Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk. These publications follow a consultation on both documents in August 2020. In the first document, the BCBS provides a series of principles on the topic of operational resilience. Although these principles aim to make banks better able to withstand, adapt to, and recover from severe adverse events, they are largely carried over from existing principles. In the second document, the BCBS updated its existing set of principles for the sound management of operational risk. The Bank does not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on its activities at this time. On June 18, 2021, OSFI released for consultation two documents on the proposed practices for managing operational risk capital data: Data Maintenance Expectations for Institutions Using the Standardized Approach for Operational Risk Capital Data and Assessment Tool - Operational Risk Capital Data. The consultation aims to ensure that financial institutions have an effective management framework for current and historical operational risk data. The Bank is participating in the consultations.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the BCBS issued a consultative document entitled Prudential Treatment of Crypto Asset Exposures. This document presents preliminary proposals for the prudential treatment of the crypto asset exposures of banks. On July 5, 2021, OSFI started its own consultation on crypto asset exposures in order to ensure that Canadian perspectives are well represented in international discussions. In addition to the BCBS questions listed in its consultative document, OSFI is seeking feedback on some other questions. The Bank is participating in the consultations.\n\nOn August 12, 2021, OSFI confirmed that the exclusion of sovereign-issued securities that qualify as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) from the leverage ratio exposure measure, a mechanism that was introduced at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, would not be extended beyond December 31, 2021. Central bank reserves will, however, continue to be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\n## C Caappiittaall  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  iinn  22002211\n\n## M Maannaaggeemmeenntt  AAccttiivviittiieess\n\nOn March 13, 2020, OSFI indicated that it was expecting all banks to cease any dividend increases or share buybacks. Since that date, the Bank has not increased dividends or bought back any of its common shares. On November 4, 2021, OSFI amended its capital distribution expectations, namely, by permitting financial institutions to increase regular dividends and, subject to OSFI approval, buy back shares. On November 30, 2021, the Bank's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase on common shares of 16 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 as well as a normal course issuer bid to repurchase for cancellation, beginning on December 10, 2021, up to 7,000,000 common shares (representing approximately 2% of its common shares outstanding) over a 12-month period ending December 9, 2022. This normal course issuer bid is subject to the approval of the OSFI and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX).\n\nOn April 21, 2021, the Bank issued $500 million of Series 2 Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN - Series 2) for which noteholder recourse is limited to the assets held by an independent trustee in a consolidated limited recourse trust. The assets of this trust consist of $500 million of Series 45 First Preferred Shares issued by the Bank, in parallel with the LRCN - Series 2. The LRCN - Series 2 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.05% per annum until August 15, 2026 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the yield on five-year Government of Canada bonds plus 3.045% until August 15, 2076. Since the LRCN - Series 2 satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, i.e., the first business day after the May 15, 2021 redemption date, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 34 First Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the share conditions, the redemption price was $25.00 per share plus the periodic dividend declared and unpaid. The Bank redeemed 16,000,000 Series 34 preferred shares for $400 million.\n\nOn August 16, 2021, i.e., the first business day after the August 15, 2021 redemption date, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 36 First Preferred Shares. Pursuant to the share conditions, the redemption price was $25.00 per share plus the periodic dividend declared and unpaid. The Bank redeemed 16,000,000 Series 36 preferred shares for $400 million.\n\nAs at October 31, 2021, the Bank had 337,912,283 issued and outstanding common shares compared to 335,997,660 a year earlier as well as 66,000,000 issued and outstanding preferred shares compared to 98,000,000 as at October 31, 2020. Moreover, as at October 31, 2021, the Bank had 1,000,000 LRCN compared to 500,000 a year earlier.

However, on November 4, 2021, OSFI amended its capital distribution expectations by permitting the boards of directors and the senior management of Canadian banks to make capital distribution decisions, i.e., dividend increases and share buybacks. The Bank has taken a prudent approach to managing regulatory capital and remains confident in its ability to increase earnings going forward.\n\n## S Shhaarreess,,  OOtthheerr  EEqquuiittyy  IInnssttrruummeennttss,,  aanndd  SSttoocckk  OOppttiioonnss\n\n|                          | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211     | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                          | N Nuummbbeerr  ooff  sshhaarreess  oorr  LLRRCCNN | $ $  mmiilllliioonn                             |\n| First preferred shares   |                                                   |                                                 |\n| Series 30                | 1 144,,000000,,000000                             | 3 35500                                         |\n| Series 32                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n| Series 38                | 1 166,,000000,,000000                             | 4 40000                                         |\n| Series 40                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n| Series 42                | 1 122,,000000,,000000                             | 3 30000                                         |\n|                          | 6 666,,000000,,000000                             | 1 1,,665500                                     |\n| Other equity instruments |                                                   |                                                 |\n| LRCN  -  Series 1        | 5 50000,,000000                                   | 5 50000                                         |\n| LRCN  -  Series 2        | 5 50000,,000000                                   | 5 50000                                         |\n|                          | 1 1,,000000,,000000                               | 1 1,,000000                                     |\n|                          | 6 677,,000000,,000000                             | 2 2,,665500                                     |\n| Common shares            | 3 33377,,991122,,228833                           | 3 3,,116600                                     |\n| Stock options            | 1 111,,334488,,668800                             |                                                 |\n\nAs at November 26, 2021, there were 337,918,444 common shares and 11,329,474 stock options outstanding. NVCC provisions require the conversion of capital instruments into a variable number of common shares should OSFI deem a bank to be non-viable or should the government publicly announce that a bank has accepted or agreed to accept an injection of capital. If an NVCC trigger event were to occur, all of the Bank's preferred shares and LRCNs and mediumterm notes maturing on February 1, 2028, which are NVCC capital instruments, would be converted into common shares of the Bank according to an automatic conversion formula at a conversion price corresponding to the greater of the following amounts: (i) a $5.00 contractual floor price; or (ii) the market price of the Bank's common shares on the date of the trigger event (10-day weighted average price). Based on a $5.00 floor price and including an estimate for accrued dividends and interest, these NVCC capital instruments would be converted into a maximum of 763 million Bank common shares, which would have a 69.3% dilutive effect based on the number of Bank common shares outstanding as at October 31, 2021.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The increase in the CET1 capital ratio since October 31, 2020 was essentially due to net income net of dividends, common share issuances under the Stock Option Plan, and remeasurements of pension plans and other postemployment benefit plans. These factors were partly offset by the organic growth in RWA, by the impact of the transitional measures applicable to ECL provisioning, of which the scaling factor decreased to 50% from 70%, by the impact of unwinding the temporary reduction of stressed VaR multipliers, and by the impact of the acquisition of Flinks. The stability seen in the Tier 1 capital ratio and in the Total capital ratio is explained essentially by redemptions of the Series 34 and Series 36 preferred shares, tempered by the above-mentioned factors and by the issuance of Limited Recourse Capital Notes (LRCN) - Series 2. As at October 31, 2021, the leverage ratio was 4.4%, stable compared to October 31, 2020. The growth in Tier 1 capital, explained by the above-mentioned factors, and significant growth in total exposure were partly offset by temporary measures announced by OSFI with respect to the exclusion of exposures from central bank reserves and sovereign-issued securities that qualify as HQLA securities under the Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  CCaappiittaall  aanndd  RRaattiiooss  UUnnddeerr  BBaasseell  IIIIII (1)\n\n| As at October 31                          | 2 2002211             | 2 2002211       | 2020         | 2020    |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|--------------|---------|\n|                                           | A Addjjuusstteedd (2) |                 | Adjusted (2) |         |\n| C Caappiittaall                           |                       |                 |              |         |\n| CET1                                      | 1 122,,886666         | 1 122,,997733   | 10,924       | 11,167  |\n| Tier 1                                    | 1 155,,551155         | 1 155,,662222   | 13,869       | 14,112  |\n| Total                                     | 1 166,,664433         | 1 166,,664433   | 15,167       | 15,167  |\n| R Riisskk--wweeiigghhtteedd  aasssseettss | 1 10044,,335588       | 1 10044,,335588 | 94,808       | 94,808  |\n| T Toottaall  eexxppoossuurree             | 3 35511,,116600       | 3 35511,,116600 | 321,038      | 321,038 |\n| C Caappiittaall  rraattiiooss             |                       |                 |              |         |\n| CET1                                      | 1 122..33   % %       | 1 122..44   % % | 11.5  %      | 11.8  % |\n| Tier 1                                    | 1 144..99   % %       | 1 155..00   % % | 14.6  %      | 14.9  % |\n| Total                                     | 1 155..99   % %       | 1 155..99   % % | 16.0  %      | 16.0  % |\n| L Leevveerraaggee  rraattiioo             | 4 4..44   % %         | 4 4..44   % %   | 4.3  %       | 4.4  %  |\n\n- (2) The adjusted capital and adjusted capital ratios do not take into account the transitional measure for provisioning of expected credit losses.

Economic capital takes into consideration the credit, market, operational, business and other risks to which the Bank is exposed as well as the risk diversification effect among them and among the business segments. Economic capital thus helps the Bank to determine the capital required to protect itself against such risks and ensure its long-term viability. The by-segment allocation of economic capital and regulatory RWA was carried out on a stand-alone basis before attribution of goodwill and intangible assets. The method used to assess economic capital is reviewed regularly in order to accurately quantify these risks.\n\nThe Risk Management section of this MD&A provides comprehensive information about the main types of risk.

The Bank views risk as an integral part of its development and the diversification of its activities. It advocates a risk management approach consistent with its business strategy. The Bank voluntarily exposes itself to certain risk categories, particularly credit and market risk, in order to generate revenue. It assumes certain risks that are inherent to its activities-to which it does not choose to expose itself-and that do not generate revenue, i.e., mainly operational risks. The purpose of sound and effective risk management is to provide reasonable assurance that incurred risks do not exceed acceptable thresholds, to control the volatility in the Bank's results, and to ensure that risk-taking contributes to the creation of shareholder value.\n\n## R Riisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nRisk is rigorously managed. Risks are identified, measured, and controlled to achieve an appropriate balance between the returns obtained and the risks assumed. The Bank continues to closely monitor the impacts and potential consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is impossible to predict all of the impacts that the pandemic could have on the global economy, in the countries where the Bank operates, on the Bank's clients, or on the Bank itself, in particular on its business activities, operating results, financial position, regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, reputation, and ability to meet regulatory requirements. From its onset, the pandemic has had disruptive and adverse effects in the countries where the Bank does business and, more broadly, on the global economy. COVID-19 has also shed light, and could continue to shed light, on several top and emerging risks to which the Bank is exposed. Despite this exceptional situation, risks are being rigorously managed. Decision-making is being guided by risk assessments aligned with the Bank's risk appetite as well as with prudent levels of capital and liquidity. Despite the exercise of stringent risk management and the mitigation measures in place, risk cannot be suppressed entirely, and residual risks may occasionally cause significant losses.\n\nThe Bank has developed guidelines that support sound and effective risk management:\n\n- \u00b7 risk is everyone's business: business units, risk management and oversight functions as well as Internal Audit play an important role in ensuring a risk management framework is in place;\n- \u00b7 client-centric: having quality information is key to understanding clients, effectively managing risk, and delivering excellent client service;\n- \u00b7 enterprise-wide: an integrated view of risk is the basis for sound and effective risk management and decision-making by management;\n- \u00b7 human capital: the Bank's employees are engaged, experienced and have a high level of expertise; their curiosity supports continuous development and their rigour ensures that risk management is built into the corporate culture;\n- \u00b7 fact-based: good risk management relies heavily on common sense and good judgment and on advanced systems and models.\n\n## RRiisskk  AAppppeettiittee\n\nRisk appetite represents how much risk an organization is willing to assume to achieve its business strategy. The Bank defines its risk appetite by setting tolerance thresholds, by aligning those thresholds with its business strategy, and by integrating risk management throughout its corporate culture. Risk appetite is built into decision-making processes as well as into strategic, financial and capital planning.\n\nThe Bank's risk appetite framework consists of principles, statements, metrics as well as targets and is reinforced by policies and limits. When setting its risk appetite  targets,  the  Bank  considers  regulatory  constraints  and  the  expectations  of  stakeholders,  in  particular  customers,  employees,  the  community, shareholders, regulatory agencies, governments, and rating agencies. The risk appetite framework is defined by the following principles and statements:\n\nThe Bank's brand, reputation and long-term viability are at the centre of our decisions, which demand:\n\n- \u00b7 a strong credit rating to be maintained;\n- \u00b7 a strong capital and cash position;\n- \u00b7 rigorous management of regulatory compliance risk, including sales practices;\n- \u00b7 zero tolerance for negligence in information security.\n\nThe Bank understands the risks taken; they are aligned with our business strategy and translate into:\n\n- \u00b7 a risk-reward balance;\n- \u00b7 a stable risk profile;\n- \u00b7 a strategic level of concentration aligned with approved targets.\n\nThe Bank's transformation and simplification plan is being carried out without compromising rigorous risk management, which is reflected in:\n\n- \u00b7 a low tolerance to operational and reputation risk;\n- \u00b7 operational and information systems stability, both under normal circumstances and in times of crisis.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "The Bank's management and business units are involved in the process for setting the risk appetite and are responsible for adequately monitoring the chosen risk indicators. These needs are assessed by means of the enterprise strategic planning process. The risk indicators are reported on a regular basis to ensure an effective alignment of the Bank's risk profile to its risk appetite; otherwise, appropriate actions could be taken. Additional information on the key credit, market and liquidity risk indicators monitored by the Bank's management is presented on the following pages.\n\n## EEnntteerrpprriissee--WWiiddee  SSttrreessss  TTeessttiinngg\n\nAs part of a more extensive process aimed at ensuring that the Bank maintains adequate capital levels commensurate with its business strategy and risk appetite, an enterprise-wide stress testing program is in place at the Bank. Stress testing can be defined as a risk management method that assesses the potential effects-on the Bank's financial position, capital and liquidity-of a series of specified changes in risk factors, corresponding to exceptional but plausible events. The program supports management's decision-making process by identifying potential vulnerabilities for the Bank as a whole that are considered in setting limits as well as in longer term business planning. The scenarios and stress test results are approved by the Stress Testing Oversight Committee and are reviewed by the Global Risk Committee (GRC) and the Risk Management Committee (RMC). For additional information, see the Stress Testing and Crisis Scenarios sections of this MD&A applicable to credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\n\n## I Innccoorrppoorraattiioonn  ooff  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  IInnttoo  tthhee  CCoorrppoorraattee  CCuullttuurree\n\nRisk management is supported by the Bank's cultural evolution through, notably, the following pillars:\n\n- \uf0b7 Tone set by management: The Bank's management continually promotes risk management through internal communications. The Bank's risk management is therefore known to all.\n- \uf0b7 Shared accountability: A balanced approach is advocated, whereby business development initiatives are combined with a constant focus on sound and effective risk management. In particular, risk is taken into consideration when preparing the segments' business plans, when analyzing strategic initiatives, and when launching new products.\n- \uf0b7 Transparency:  A  foundation  of  the  business's  values,  transparency  lets  us  communicate  our  concerns  quickly  without  fear  of  reprisal.  We  are  a learning-focused organization where employees are allowed to make mistakes.\n- \uf0b7 Behaviour: The Bank's risk management is strengthened by incentive compensation programs that are structured to reflect the Bank's risk appetite.\n- \uf0b7 Continuous development: All employees must complete mandatory annual regulatory compliance training focused on the Bank's Code of Conduct and Ethics and on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) efforts as well as cybersecurity training. Risk management training is also offered across all segments of the Bank.\n\nIn addition to these five pillars, Internal Audit carries out an evaluation of the culture as part of its mandate. Furthermore, to ensure the effectiveness of the existing risk management framework, the Bank has defined clear roles and responsibilities by reinforcing the concept of the three lines of defence. The Governance Structure section presented on the following pages defines this concept as well as the roles and responsibilities at all levels of the organization.\n\n## FFiirrsstt  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee Risk Owner\n\nBusiness Units\n\n- \u00b7 Identify, manage, assess and mitigate risks in day-to-day activities.\n- \u00b7 Ensure activities are in alignment with the Bank's risk appetite and risk management policies.\n\n## S Seeccoonndd  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee\n\nIndependent Oversight\n\nRisk Management and Oversight Functions\n\n- \u00b7 Oversee risk management by setting policies and standards.\n- \u00b7 Provide independent oversight of management practices and an independent challenge of the first line of defence.\n- \u00b7 Promote sound risk management at the Bank.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and report on risk.\n\n## T Thhiirrdd  LLiinnee  ooff  DDeeffeennccee\n\nIndependent Assurance\n\n## Internal Audit\n\n- \u00b7 Provide the Board and management with independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems.\n- \u00b7 Provide recommendations and advice to promote the Bank's long-term financial strength.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It  also  exercises  independent  oversight  and  evaluation  of  the compliance of the Bank and its subsidiaries with standards and policies on regulatory compliance risk.\n\n## The Global Risk Committee (GRC)\n\nThe Global Risk Committee defines the parameters of the policies that determine risk tolerance and the overall risk strategy, for the Bank and its subsidiaries as a whole, and sets limits as well as tolerance and intervention thresholds enabling the Bank to properly manage the main risks to which it is exposed. The committee approves and monitors all large credit facilities. It also recommends for Board approval the Bank's risk philosophy, risk appetite and risk profile management. The Operational Risk Management Committee, the Financial Markets Risk Committee, and the Enterprise-Wide Risk Management Committee presented in the governance structure chart are the primary committees reporting to the Global Risk Committee. The Global Risk Committee also carries out its mandate through the Senior Complex Valuation Committee, the Committee on Banks, the Models Oversight Committee, and the Product and Activity Review Committees.\n\n## The Compensation Risk Oversight Working Group\n\nThe working group that monitors compensation-related risks supports the Human Resources Committee in its compensation risk oversight role. It is a threemember group consisting of the Executive Vice-President, Risk Management; the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance; and the Executive Vice-President, Employee Experience. The working group helps to ensure that compensation policies and programs do not unduly encourage senior management members, officers, material risk takers or bank employees to take risks beyond the Bank's risk tolerance thresholds. As part of that role, it ensures that the Bank is adhering to the Corporate Governance Guidelines issued by OSFI and to the Principles for Sound Compensation Practices issued by the Financial Stability Board, for which the Canadian implementation and monitoring is conducted by OSFI. The Board's RMC also reviews the reports presented by this working group.\n\n## The ESG Working Group\n\nUnder the leadership of the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-President, Finance, and made up of several officers from different areas of the Bank, the ESG Working Group's main role is to develop and support the Bank's ESG initiatives and strategies. Its members meet on a monthly basis. The ESG Working Group is responsible for implementing the recommendations made by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and by the UN Principles for Responsible Banking as well as for implementing the Bank's climate commitments, including the net-zero GHG emissions target. At least twice a year, the ESG Working Group reports to the Conduct Review and Governance Committee on the progress made and on ongoing and upcoming ESG projects. In addition, and in a timely fashion, the ESG Working Group makes presentations on topics of particular interest, such as the TCFD report, to the Audit Committee and the RMC.\n\n## The Business Units\n\nAs the first line of defence, the business units manage risks related to their operations within established limits and in accordance with risk management policies by identifying, analyzing, managing, and understanding the risks to which they are exposed and implementing risk mitigation mechanisms. The management of these units must ensure that employees are adhering to current policies and limits.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

These policies cover the Bank's main risks, are reviewed regularly to ensure they are still relevant given market changes, regulatory changes and changes in the business plans of the Bank's business units, and apply to the entire Bank and its subsidiaries, when applicable. Other policies, standards, and procedures complement the main policies and cover more specific aspects of risk management such as business continuity; the launch of new products, initiatives, or activities; or financial instrument measurement.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee  ooff  MMooddeell  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe Bank makes increasing use of models to guide enterprise-wide risk management, financial markets strategy, economic and regulatory capital allocation, global credit risk management, wealth management, and profitability measures. Models have in fact become a standard in risk management. This stresses the growing importance of model risk for banks, which explains the implementation of a rigorous model risk management process to ensure models can be used appropriately and efficiently to manage risks.\n\nThe key components of the Bank's model risk management governance framework are as follows: the model risk management policies and standards, the model vetting group, and the Models Oversight Committee. The policies and standards set the rules and principles applicable to the development and independent vetting of models. The scope of models covered is wide, ranging from market risk pricing models and automated credit decision-making models to the business risk capital model, including models used for regulatory capital and stressed capital purposes, expected credit losses models, and financialcrime models. The framework also includes more advanced artificial intelligence models.\n\nOne of the cornerstones of the Bank's policies is the general principle that all models deemed important for the Bank or used for regulatory capital purposes require heightened lifecycle monitoring and independent vetting. All models used by the Bank are therefore classified in terms of risk level (low, medium, or high). Based on this classification, the Bank applies strict guidelines regarding the requirements for model development and documentation, independent review  thereof,  performance  monitoring  thereof,  and  minimum  review  frequency.  The  Bank  believes  that  the  best  defence  against  'model  risk'  is  the implementation of a robust development and validation framework.\n\n## I Innddeeppeennddeenntt  OOvveerrssiigghhtt  bbyy  tthhee  CCoommpplliiaannccee  SSeerrvviiccee\n\nCompliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank. Its Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer have direct access to the RMC and to the President and Chief Executive Officer and can communicate directly with officers and directors of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres. The Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer regularly meets with the Chair of the RMC (with whom she has a direct reporting relationship) in the absence of management, to review matters on the relationship between the Compliance Service and the Bank's management and on access to the information required.\n\nBusiness unit managers must oversee the implementation of mechanisms for the daily control of regulatory compliance risks arising from the operations under their responsibility. Compliance exercises independent oversight in order to assist managers in effectively managing these risks and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.\n\n## I Innddeeppeennddeenntt  AAsssseessssmmeenntt  bbyy  IInntteerrnnaall  AAuuddiitt\n\nInternal Audit is an independent, objective function within the Bank. Through the Audit Committee, it provides assurance to management and the Board as to the Bank's level of command over its activities, advises on how to improve those activities, and contributes to the creation of added value. It helps the Bank to achieve its objectives by assessing the effectiveness of its main governance, risk management, and internal control processes and systems and formulates recommendations and advice to promote the Bank's long-term financial strength.\n\nThe Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit, reports to the Chair of the Audit Committee. Her independence is ensured through an administrative relationship with the President and Chief Executive Officer, and she may, at any time, call an unscheduled Audit Committee meeting.\n\n## T Toopp  aanndd  EEmmeerrggiinngg  RRiisskkss\n\nManaging risk requires a solid understanding of every type of risk found across the Bank, as they could have a material adverse effect on the Bank's business, results of operations, financial position and reputation. As part of its approach to risk management, the Bank identifies, assesses, reviews and monitors the range of top and emerging risks to which it is exposed in order to proactively manage them and implement appropriate mitigation strategies. Identified top and emerging risks are presented to senior management and communicated to the RMC.\n\nThe Bank separately qualifies the risks to which it is exposed: a 'top risk' is a risk that has been identified, is clearly defined, and could have a significant impact on the Bank's business, results of operations, financial position, and reputation, while an 'emerging risk' is a risk that, while it may also have an impact on the Bank, is not well understood in terms of its likelihood, consequences, timing, or the extent of its potential impact.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It has also affected and may continue to affect the Bank and how it conducts business as well as its clients. This situation provides perspective on some of the top and emerging risks to which the Bank is exposed. Additional information is provided in the COVID-19 Pandemic section of this MD&A.\n\nThe Bank is also exposed to other so-called emerging or significant risks, which are defined as follows.\n\n## R Riisskk  aanndd T Trreenndd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D Deessccrriippttiioonn\n\nTechnology, which is now omnipresent in our daily lives, is at the heart of banking services and has become the main driver of innovation in the financial sector. While this digital transformation meets the growing needs of customers by enhancing the operational efficiency of institutions, it nevertheless comes with information security and cybersecurity risks. The personal information and financial data  of  financial  institution  customers  are  prime  targets  for  criminals.  These  criminals,  who  are  increasingly  well  organized  and employing ever more sophisticated schemes, try to use technology to steal information.\n\nFaced with a resurgence of cyberthreats and the sophistication of cybercriminals, the Bank is exposed to the risks associated with data breaches, malicious software, unauthorized access, hacking, phishing, identity theft, intellectual property theft, asset theft, industrial espionage, and possible denial of service due to activities causing network failures and service interruptions.\n\nCyberattacks, as with system breaches or interruptions that support the Bank and its customers, could cause client attrition; financial loss; inability of clients to do their banking; non-compliance with privacy legislation or any other laws in effect; legal disputes; fines; penalties or regulatory action; reputational damage; compliance costs, corrective measures, investigative, or restoration costs; cost hikes to maintain and upgrade technological infrastructures and systems, all of which could affect the Bank's operating results or financial position, in addition to having an impact on its reputation.\n\nIt is also possible for the Bank to be unable to prevent or implement effective preventive measures against every potential cyberthreat, as the tactics used are multiplying, change frequently, come from a wide range of sources, and are increasingly sophisticated.\n\nWithin this context, the Bank works to ensure the integrity and protection of its systems and the information they contain. The Bank reaffirms its commitment to continuous improvement in the area of information security, the ultimate goal being to protect its customers and maintain their trust. Along with its partners in the financial sector and with the regulatory authorities, the Bank is committed to making a sustained effort to mitigate technology risks. Measures specifically directed at anticipating this type of threat include the formation of multidisciplinary teams comprising cybersecurity and fraud prevention specialists. The Bank is also pursuing initiatives under its own cybersecurity program aimed at adapting its protection, surveillance, detection, and response capabilities in response to changing threats, the aim being to continue to reduce delays in detecting any anomalies or cybersecurity incidents and limiting the impact thereof as much as possible. A governance and accountability structure has also been established to support decision-making based on sound risk management. The Technology Subcommittee is regularly informed of cybersecurity trends and developments and of lessons learned from operational incidents that have occurred in other large organizations in order to gain a better understanding of potential risks, particularly risks related to cybersecurity and the protection of personal information.\n\nThe risks related to protecting personal information exist throughout the lifecycle of the data and arise, in particular, from inadequate control measures and weak processes. Such risks can translate into financial risk, reputation risk, technology risk, and even legal risk, among others. Innovations and proliferation in technologies that collect, use, and share personal information have led to substantial legislative changes in recent years.\n\nThese  changes  have  come  about  swiftly  in  several  jurisdictions,  including  Canada  and  Quebec.  In  September 2021,  the  Quebec government passed An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information, which will gradually come into effect over the next three years. The tabling of a new federal bill is expected soon.\n\nThe Bank continues to monitor relevant legislative developments and has bolstered its governance structure by updating its policies and deploying a personal information privacy program that reflects its determination to maintain the trust of its clients.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Geopolitical events can lead to volatility, have a negative impact on at-risk assets, and cause financial conditions to deteriorate. They could also directly or indirectly affect banking activities by having an impact on clients. While new risks could arise at any time, we have some concerns compelling us to monitor certain current events. For one, the geopolitical power struggle between the United States and China has given cause for concern for a few years now, and these tensions could continue into the foreseeable future. Businesses, in particular those operating in sectors deemed strategic, run an increasing risk of finding themselves in a maze of contradictory regulations, where complying with U.S. regulations means violating Chinese law, and vice versa. These tensions could also partially undo some of the ties forged between these two superpowers in the financial markets, and Canada might get caught in the crosshairs of the two countries. The potential for confrontation is not limited to the China-U.S. relationship, as protectionism is gaining popularity and a growing number of countries are implementing measures to both financially support domestic businesses in key sectors (high tech, health care, and food) and to protect them against global competition through business restrictions. The combined effects of supply shortages and geopolitical tensions have shifted the focus from efficiency to supply security. We will continue to monitor all of these developments, analyze any new risks that arise, and assess the impacts that they may have on our organization.\n\nAlthough the economy recovered quickly during the pandemic, a number of risks still remain. Despite high vaccination rates in Canada, the evolution of the pandemic remains uncertain, and vaccines are not readily accessible in several emerging countries. Against this backdrop, another wave of the pandemic or the emergence of a more aggressive variant could result in a return to stricter health measures and slow the recovery of certain sectors of the economy. If this were to occur, consumer and business confidence could be rattled and weaken economic activity. Moreover, uncertainty persists regarding inflation forecasts. While central banks believe the current high level of inflation to be temporary, there is a risk that supply chain bottlenecks will not be resolved as swiftly as anticipated. Conversely, if inflation proves to be more persistent, it could erode consumer buying power and lead to a less dynamic economic recovery. However, workers seem to be in a good position to negotiate salaries in light of the current labour shortages, which presents another risk, i.e., the risk of spiralling inflation created by higher wages. If this scenario of unchecked inflation were to occur (above target), central banks could push for a tighter monetary policy by raising interest rates substantially. Due to extraordinary monetary measures, interest rates have remained quite low worldwide. This environment may have led to excessive risk-taking strategies on the part of market proponents seeking additional returns, which could create negative impacts if interest rates should suddenly spike. This would serve as a major headwind for the real estate sector and Canadian households, which have seen their debt levels rise sharply over the past few years. Lastly, climate issues are an added risk in the current context. If too few measures are adopted on the climate front, severe weather events will intensify and result in economic woes over the long term. Conversely, a too-swift transition could result in  other  risks,  particularly  short-  and  medium-term  costs  and  rising  pressure  on  production  costs.  In  short,  given  the  ongoing uncertainties in this environment, the Bank remains vigilant in the face of numerous factors and continues to rely on its strong risk management framework to identify, assess, and mitigate the negative impacts while also remaining within its risk appetite limits.\n\nThe Bank is reliant on technology, as clients are seeking greater access to products and services on a variety of platforms that must support substantial data volumes. The fast pace of technological change combined with both client and competitive pressures require significant and sustained technology investments. Inadequate implementation of technological improvements or new products or services could significantly affect the Bank's ability to serve and retain clients.\n\nThird parties provide essential components of the Bank's technological infrastructure such as Internet connections and access to network and other communications services. The Bank also relies on the services of third parties to support certain business processes and to handle certain IT activities. An interruption of these services or a breach of security could have an unfavourable impact on the Bank's ability to provide products and services to its customers and to conduct business, not to mention the impact that such events would have on the Bank's reputation. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has a third-party risk management framework wherein information security, financial health, and performance are validated before any agreements are reached and throughout the life of the agreements. It also includes business continuity plans, which are tested periodically to ensure their effectiveness in times of crisis. A governance and accountability structure has also been established to support decision-making based on sound risk management. Despite these preventive measures and the efforts deployed by the Bank to manage third parties, there remains a possibility that certain risks will materialize. In such cases, the Bank would rely on mitigation mechanisms developed in collaboration with the various agreement owners and third parties concerned. Aware of the significance of third-party risk, the Bank makes sure that its practices evolve in collaboration with its financial sector partners and with regulatory authorities.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Physical risks refer to the potential impacts of more frequent and more intense extreme weather events or of chronic changes in weather conditions on physical assets, infrastructures, the value chain, and other physical aspects. Transition risks refer to the potential impacts of moving toward a low-carbon economy (such as technological changes or political or public policy shifts designed to reduce GHG emissions through taxes or incentives) as well as to regulatory changes made to manage and support such an economy.\n\nManaging climate risk has become increasingly important, as evidenced by the interest level in this risk, aligned over a societal, political  and  regulatory  landscape  in  constant  flux,  shown  by  the  Bank's  stakeholders,  in  particular  clients,  shareholders, governments, and regulators.\n\nIt is possible that the Bank's or its clients' business models fail to align with a low-carbon economy or that their responses to government strategies and regulatory changes prove inadequate or fail to achieve the target objectives. As such, these risks could result in financial losses for the Bank, affect its operations and the way it conducts business, harm its reputation and increase its regulatory compliance risk, or even affect the activities and financial position of the clients to whom it offers financial services.\n\nThe actual impact of climate risk will depend on future events that are beyond the Bank's control. The Bank must therefore devote special  attention  to  reducing  its  exposure  to  these  negative  outside  factors  and,  at  the  same  time,  to  seizing  new  growth opportunities. While the Bank is committed to doing everything in its power to mitigate climate risk and to support the move to a lowcarbon economy, it cannot predict the effectiveness of government-led climate strategies or of regulatory changes enacted, nor can it assume responsibility for achieving the objectives set out in these strategies and changes.\n\nThe Bank continues to closely monitor developments on this topic and to deploy its climate change risk management framework.\n\nFor additional information, see the Environmental and Social Risk section of this MD&A.\n\nOn one hand, the Bank's financial performance depends on its ability to develop and market new and innovative products and services, adopt and develop new technologies that help differentiate its products and services and generate cost savings, and market these new products and services at the right time and at competitive prices. On the other hand, failure to properly review critical changes within the business before and during the implementation and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align client  expectations  with  the  Bank's  client  commitments  and  operating  capabilities  could  adversely  affect  the  Bank's  business, operating results, financial position, and reputation.\n\nThe transition towards new digital channels and solutions has accelerated greatly following the COVID-19 pandemic, where demand for digital banking services grew to the detriment of traditional banking services. The arrival of new, non-conventional players in the market  has  intensified  competitive  pressure,  as  they  offer  new  technologies  that  enhance  the  client  experience  due  to  the development of new data analysis tools and customized solutions while meeting user expectations for simplicity, and doing so at a lower cost. These new digital businesses, which are not necessarily subject to the same regulatory requirements, have the ability to react quickly to new consumer trends through the deployment of new technologies. As such, to mitigate disintermediation risk and help make innovative technologies accessible to its clients, the Bank continues to incorporate artificial intelligence into its business processes and it remains highly committed to innovation by making strategic investments in emerging technologies through its specialized venture capital arm NAventures.\n\nThe Bank's future performance depends greatly on its ability to recruit, develop, and retain key resources. There is strong competition in the financial services sector in terms of attracting and retaining the most qualified people, notably with the arrival of new players in certain sectors and the emergence of the global workforce concept. As a result, reports are periodically presented to the Board through the  governance  mechanisms  of  the  Human  Resources  Committee,  the  aim  being  to  deploy  appropriate  strategies  to  implement conditions favourable to the Bank's competitiveness as an employer. There is no assurance that the Bank or a business acquired by the Bank will be able to continue recruiting or retaining talented people.\n\nNational Bank of Canada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## T Teecchhnnoollooggiiccaall i innnnoovvaattiioonn  aanndd c coommppeettiittiioonn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

While these risks do not affect a significant proportion of the Bank's portfolios, their impact must not be overlooked, especially those that are of a legal or regulatory nature. Such risk can be particularly high when the exposure is in a territory where the enforceability of agreements signed by the Bank is uncertain, in countries and regions facing political or socio-economic disturbances, or in countries that may be subject to international sanctions. Generally speaking, there are many ways in which the Bank may be exposed to the risks posed by other countries, not the least of which being foreign laws and regulations. In all such situations, it is important to consider what is referred to as 'country risk.' Country risk affects not only the activities that the Bank carries out abroad but also the business that it conducts with non-resident clients as well as the services it provides to clients doing business abroad, such as electronic funds transfers, international products and transactions made from Canada in foreign currencies.\n\nAs part of its activities, the Bank must adhere to anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/ATF) regulatory requirements in effect in each jurisdiction where it conducts business. It must also comply with the requirements pertaining to current international sanctions in these various jurisdictions. Money laundering and terrorist financing is a financial, regulatory, and reputation risk. For additional information, see the Regulatory Compliance Risk Management section of this MD&A.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to financial risks outside Canada and the United States primarily through its interbank transactions on international financial markets or through international trade finance activities. This geographic exposure represents a moderate proportion of the Bank's total risk. The geographic exposure of loans is disclosed in the quarterly Supplementary Financial Information report available on the Bank's website at nbc.ca. To control country risk, the Bank sets credit concentration limits by country and reviews and submits them to the Board for approval upon renewal of the Credit Risk Management Policy. These limits are based on a percentage of the Bank's regulatory capital, in line with the level of risk represented by each country, particularly emerging countries. The risk is rated using a classification mechanism similar to the one used for credit default risk. In addition to the country limits, authorization caps and limits are established, as a percentage of capital, for the world's high-risk regions, i.e., essentially all regions except for North America, Western European countries and the developed countries of Asia.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThe Bank's ability to successfully complete an acquisition is often conditional on regulatory approval, and the Bank cannot be certain of the timing or conditions of regulatory decisions. Acquisitions could affect future results should the Bank experience difficulty integrating the acquired business. If the Bank does encounter difficulty integrating an acquired business, maintaining an appropriate governance level over the acquired business, or retaining key officers within the acquired business, these factors could prevent the Bank from realizing expected revenue growth, cost savings, market share gains, and other projected benefits of the acquisition.\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nThe Bank protects the intellectual property developed by its employees in connection with their duties. However, in some cases, it may have a more limited ability to acquire intellectual property rights. Moreover, the intellectual property rights acquired by the Bank provide no guarantees that they will be effective in deterring or preventing a third party from misappropriating intellectual property or providing a defense against the misappropriation of intellectual property. Moreover, the goods and services developed by the Bank are provided in a competitive market where third parties could hold intellectual property rights prior to those held by the Bank. In such circumstances, there is no guarantee that the Bank will successfully provide a defense against an infringement claim, that it will be able to modify its goods and services to avoid infringing upon third party rights, or that it will obtain a licence with commercially acceptable conditions.\n\n## Judicial and Regulatory Proceedings\n\nThe Bank takes reasonable measures to comply with the laws and regulations in effect in the jurisdictions where it operates. Should these measures prove ineffective, the Bank could be subject to judicial or regulatory decisions resulting in fines, damages, or other costs or to restrictions likely to adversely affect its operating results or its reputation. The Bank may also be subject to litigation in the normal course of business. Although the Bank establishes provisions for the measures it is subject to under accounting requirements, actual losses resulting from such litigation could differ significantly from the recognized amounts, and unfavourable outcomes in such cases could have a significant adverse effect on the Bank's operating results. The resulting reputational damage could also affect the Bank's future business prospects. For additional information, see Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Tax Risk\n\nThe tax laws applicable to the Bank are numerous, complex, and subject to amendment. This complexity can result in differing legal interpretations between the Bank and the respective tax authorities with which it deals. In addition, legislative changes and changes in tax policy, including their interpretation by tax authorities and courts, can affect the Bank's earnings. International and domestic initiatives may result in changes to tax laws and policies, including international efforts by the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to broaden the tax base and potential domestic proposals to increase the taxes payable by banks and insurance companies. For additional information on income taxes, see the Income Taxes section on page 56 of this MD&A, the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section on page 112 of this MD&A, and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies, Methods and Estimates Used by the Bank\n\nThe accounting policies and methods used by the Bank determine how the Bank reports its financial position and operating results and require management to make estimates or rely on assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Any changes to these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on the Bank's operating results and financial position.\n\n## Additional Factors\n\nFactors that could affect the Bank's business, operating results, and reputation include unexpected changes in consumer spending and saving habits, the timely development and launch of new products and services, the ability to successfully align its organizational structure, resources and processes, the ability to  activate  a  business  continuity  plan  within  a  reasonable  time,  the  potential  impact  of  international  conflicts,  natural  catastrophes  or  public  health emergencies such as COVID-19, and the Bank's ability to foresee and effectively manage the risks associated with these factors through rigorous risk management.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of incurring a financial loss if an obligor does not fully honour its contractual commitments to the Bank. Obligors may be debtors, issuers, counterparties, or guarantors. Credit risk is the most significant risk facing the Bank in the normal course of business. The Bank is exposed to credit risk not only through its direct lending activities and transactions but also through commitments to extend credit, letters of guarantee, letters of credit, over-thecounter  derivatives  trading,  debt  securities,  securities  purchased  under  reverse  repurchase  agreements,  deposits  with  financial  institutions,  brokerage activities, and transactions carrying a settlement risk for the Bank such as irrevocable fund transfers to third parties via electronic payment systems.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, impacts on the Bank's clients. Since a large part of the Bank's activities consist of granting loans or providing various liquidity channels to clients, namely, to individuals, businesses in various sectors, and governments, the impacts of the pandemic on these parties could have significant impacts on the provisions for credit losses recorded by the Bank.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee\n\nA policy framework centralizes the governance of activities that generate credit risk for the Bank and its subsidiaries and is supplemented by a series of subordinate internal policies and standards. These policies and standards address specific management issues such as concentration limits by borrower group and sector, credit limits, collateral requirements and risk quantification or issues that provide more thorough guidance for given business segments.\n\nFor example, the institutional activities of the Bank and its subsidiaries on financial markets and international commercial transactions are governed by business unit directives that set out standards adapted to the specific environment of these activities. This also applies to retail brokerage subsidiaries. In isolated cases, a business unit or subsidiary may have its own credit policy, and that policy must always fall within the spirit of the Bank's policy framework. Risk Management's leadership team defines the scope of the universe of subsidiaries carrying significant credit risks and the magnitude of the risks incurred.\n\nCredit risk is controlled through a rigorous process that comprises the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 credit risk rating and assessment;\n- \u00b7 economic capital assessment;\n- \u00b7 stress testing and crisis scenarios;\n- \u00b7 credit granting process;\n- \u00b7 revision and renewal process;\n- \u00b7 risk mitigation;\n- \u00b7 follow-up of monitored accounts and recovery;\n- \u00b7 counterparty risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 settlement risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 environmental risk assessment.\n\n## Concentration Limit\n\nThe Bank sets credit concentration and settlement limits by obligor group (businesses, oil and gas producers, government sectors, banks), by industry sector, by country and by region. These limits are subject to the approval of the RMC. Certain types of financing or financing programs are also subject to specific limits. Breaches of concentration limits by obligor group or by region are reported to the RMC each quarter. Furthermore, every industry sector, country, and region whose exposure equals a predetermined percentage of the corresponding authorized limit are reported to the Bank's Risk Management leadership team. At least once a year, the Bank revises these exposures by industry sector, by country, and by region in order to determine the appropriateness of the corresponding concentration limits.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It presents changes in the credit portfolio and highlights on the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 credit portfolio volume growth by business segment;\n- \u00b7 a breakdown of the credit portfolio according to various criteria for which concentration limits have been set;\n- \u00b7 changes in provisions and allowances for credit losses;\n- \u00b7 changes in impaired loans;\n- \u00b7 follow-up of monitored accounts.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  RRaattiinngg  aanndd  AAsssseessssmmeenntt\n\nBefore a sound and prudent credit decision can be made, the obligor's or counterparty's credit risk must be accurately assessed. This is the first step in processing credit applications. Each application is analyzed and assigned one of 19 grades on a scale of 1 to 10 using a credit rating system developed by the Bank for all portfolios exposed to credit risk. As each grade corresponds to a debtor's, counterparty's or third party's probability of default, the Bank can estimate the credit risk. The credit risk assessment method varies according to portfolio type. There are two main methods for assessing credit risk, i.e., the Advanced Internal Rating-Based (AIRB) Approach and the Standardized Approach, as defined by the Basel Accord to determine minimum regulatory capital requirements for most of its portfolios.\n\nThe main parameters used to measure the credit risk of loans outstanding and undrawn amounts under the AIRB Approach are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 probability of default (PD), which is the probability of through-the-cycle 12-month default by the obligor, calibrated on a long-run average PD throughout a full economic cycle;\n- \u00b7 loss given default (LGD), which represents the magnitude of the loss from the obligor's default that would be expected in an economic downturn and subject to certain regulatory floors, expressed as a percentage of exposure at default;\n- \u00b7 exposure at default (EAD), which is an estimate of the amount drawn and of the expected use of any undrawn portion prior to default, and cannot be lower than the current balance.\n\nThe methodology as well as the data and the downturn periods used to estimate LGD are described below.\n\n| A AIIRRBB  AAPPPPRROOAACCHH                                                                                                                        | D DAATTAA (1)                                        | D DOOWWNNTTUURRNN  PPEERRIIOODD (1)                                                              | M MEETTHHOODDOOLLOOGGYY  FFOORR  CCAALLCCUULLAATTIINNGG  LLGGDD   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Bank's internal historical data from 1996 to 2019                                                                                              | 1996-1998 and 2008-2009                              | LGD based on the Bank's historical  internal data on recoveries and losses                       | Retail                                                            |\n| The Bank's internal historical data from 2000 to 2018  Benchmarking results using:   \u00b7 Moody's observed default price of bonds,  from 1983 to 2017 | 2000-2003, 2008-2009 and  2015-2016                  | LGD based on the Bank's historical  internal data on recoveries and losses                       | Corporate                                                         |\n| Moody's observed default price of bonds, from  1983 to 2015  S&P rating history from 1975 to 2016                                                  | 1999-2001 and 2008-2012                              | Based on implied market LGD using  observed bond price decreases  following the issuer's default | Sovereign                                                         |\n| Global Credit Data Consortium historical loss and  recovery database from 1991 to 2013                                                             | 1991-1992, 1994, 1997-1998,  2001-2002 and 2008-2009 | Model for predicting LGD based on  different issue- and issuer-related risk  drivers             | Financial institutions                                            |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Personal Credit Portfolios\n\nThis category comprises portfolios of residential mortgage loans, consumer loans and loans to certain small businesses. To assess credit risk, AIRB models are in place for the main portfolios, particularly mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, budget loans, lines of credit, and SME retail. A risk analysis based on loan grouping in pools of homogeneous obligor and product profiles is used for overall management of personal credit portfolios. This personal credit assessment approach, which has proven particularly effective for estimating credit defaults and losses, takes a number of factors into account, namely:\n\n- \u00b7 behaviour scoring;\n- \u00b7 loan product characteristics;\n- \u00b7 collateral provided;\n- \u00b7 the length of time on the Bank's balance sheet;\n- \u00b7 loan status (active, delinquent or defaulted).\n\nThis mechanism provides adequate risk measurement inasmuch as it effectively differentiates risk levels by pool. Therefore, the results are periodically reviewed and, if necessary, adjustments are made to the models. Obligor migrations between pools are among the factors considered in the credit risk assessment.\n\nLoan pools are also established based on PD, LGD, and EAD, which are measured based on the characteristics of the obligor and the transaction itself. The credit risk of these portfolios is estimated using credit scoring models that determine the obligor's PD. LGD is estimated based on transaction-specific factors such as loan product characteristics (for example, a line of credit versus a term loan), loan-to-value ratio, and types of collateral.\n\nCredit scoring models are also used to grant credit. These models use proven statistical methods that measure debtors' demand characteristics and history based on internal and external historical information to estimate the debtors' future credit behaviour and assign a probability of default. The underlying data include debtor information such as current and past employment, historical loan data in the Bank's management systems and information from external sources such as credit rating agencies.\n\nThe Bank also uses behaviour scoring models to manage and monitor current commitments. The risk assessment is based on statistical analyses of the past behaviour of obligors with which the Bank has a long-term relationship in an effort to predict their future behaviour. The underlying information includes the obligor's cash flows and borrowing trends. Information on characteristics that determine behaviour in these models also comes from both internal sources on current commitments and external sources. The table on the following page presents the PD categories and the credit quality of the associated personal credit portfolio.\n\n## Mortgage Loan Underwriting\n\nIn order to mitigate the impact of an economic slowdown and ensure the long-term quality of its portfolio, the Bank uses sound risk management when granting residential mortgages to confirm: (i) the obligor's intention to meet its financial obligations, (ii) the obligor's ability to repay its debts, and (iii) the quality of the collateral. In addition, in accordance with the applicable rules, the Bank takes a prudent approach to client qualification by using, for example, a higher interest rate to mitigate the risk of short- or medium-term rate increases.\n\nNonetheless, the risk of economic slowdown could adversely affect the profitability of the mortgage portfolio. In stress test analyses, the Bank considers a variety of scenarios to measure the impact of adverse market conditions. In such circumstances, our analyses show significantly higher credit losses, which would decrease profitability and reduce the Bank's capital ratios.\n\n## New Regulatory Developments\n\nOn April 8, 2021, OSFI announced a resumption of its consultation on the minimum qualifying interest rate for uninsured mortgages and re-emphasized the importance of sound mortgage underwriting. On May 20, 2021, OSFI announced that, effective June 1, 2021, the minimum qualifying interest rate for uninsured mortgages (i.e., residential mortgages with a downpayment of at least 20%) will be the greater of the mortgage contractual rate plus 2% or a floor of 5.25%. In addition, OSFI is requiring that the qualifying interest rate be reviewed at least once a year, in December, to ensure it remains appropriate to market risks.\n\nOSFI is aware that Canada's post-pandemic economic recovery hinges on a strong financial system that can support Canadians in today's environment and that conditions in the current Canadian real estate market could put lenders at increased financial risk. As such, at this time, OSFI is taking proactive action to ensure the sustained resilience of banks. The minimum qualifying interest rate adds a margin of safety that ensures borrowers will have the ability to make mortgage payments in the event of a change in circumstances, such as a reduction in income or a rise in mortgage interest rates.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Business and Government Credit Portfolios\n\nThis category comprises business (other than some small businesses that are classified in personal credit portfolios), government and financial institution credit portfolios.\n\nThese credit portfolios are assigned a risk rating based on a detailed individual analysis of the financial and non-financial aspects of the obligor, including the obligor's financial strength, sector of economic activity, competitive ability, access to capital management quality and number of years in business. The Bank has risk-rating tools and models enabling it to specifically assess the risk represented by an obligor in relation to its industry and peers. The models used are adapted to the obligor's broad sector of activity. Models are in place for ten sectors: business/commercial, large business, financial institutions, sovereigns, investment funds, energy, real estate, agriculture, insurance, and public-private partnership project financing.\n\nThis risk assessment method assigns a default risk rating to an obligor that reflects its credit quality. To each default credit risk rating corresponds a PD (see the table below). Using this classification of obligor credit risk, the Bank can differentiate appropriately between the various assessments of an obligor's capacity to meet its contractual obligations. Default risk ratings are assigned according to an assessment of an obligor's commercial and financial risks based on a solvency review. Various risk quantification models, described below, are used to perform this assessment.\n\nThe business and government default risk rating scale used by the Bank is similar to the systems used by major external rating agencies. The following table presents a grouping of the ratings by major risk category and compares them with the ratings of two major rating agencies.\n\n## I Inntteerrnnaall  DDeeffaauulltt  RRiisskk  RRaattiinnggss**\n\n| Description     | Personal credit   | (1) portfolios   | (1) portfolios         | (1) portfolios   | (1) portfolios   | Business and government   credit portfolios   |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                 |                   |                  | Corporate and          | PD (%) -         | Standard         |                                               |\n|                 | PD (%) - Retail   | Ratings          | financial institutions | Sovereign        | & Poor's         | Moody's                                       |\n| Excellent       | 0.000-0.144       | 1-2.5            | 0.000-0.125            | 0.000-0.094      | AAA to A-        | Aaa to A3                                     |\n| Good            | 0.145-0.506       | 3-4              | 0.125-0.451            | 0.094-0.464      | BBB+ to BBB-     | Baa1 to Baa3                                  |\n| Satisfactory    | 0.507-2.681       | 4.5-6.5          | 0.451-4.743            | 0.464-6.607      | BB+ to B         | Ba1 to B2                                     |\n| Special mention | 2.682-9.348       | 7-7.5            | 4.743-11.161           | 6.607-19.120     | B- to CCC+       | B3 to Caa1                                    |\n| Substandard     | 9.349-9.999       | 8-8.5            | 11.161-99.999          | 19.120-99.999    | CCC & CCC-       | Caa2 & Caa3                                   |\n| Default         | 1                 | 9-10             | 100                    | 100              | CC, C & D        | Ca, C & D                                     |\n\nThe Bank also uses individual assessment models by industry to assign a risk rating to the credit facility based on the collateral and guarantees the obligor is able to provide and, in some cases, based on other factors. The Bank consequently has a bi-dimensional risk-rating system that, using models and based on internal and external historical data, establishes a default risk rating for each obligor. In addition, the models assign, to each credit facility, an LGD risk rating that is independent of the default risk rating assigned to the obligor.\n\nThe Bank's default risk ratings and LGD risk ratings as well as the related risk parameters contribute directly to informed credit-granting, renewal and monitoring decisions. They are also used to determine and analyze risk-based pricing. In addition, from a credit portfolio management perspective, they are used to establish counterparty credit concentration limits and segment concentration limits as well as limits to decision-making power and to determine the credit risk appetite of these portfolios. Moreover, they represent an important component in estimating expected and unexpected losses, measuring minimum required economic capital, and measuring the minimum level of capital required, as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.\n\nThe credit risk of obligors and of their facilities is assessed with the PD and LGD parameters at least once a year or more often if significant changes (triggers) are observed when updating financial information or if another qualitative indicator of a deterioration in the obligor's solvency or in the collateral associated with the obligor's facilities is noted. A watchlist also exists that enables the Bank to more actively monitor the financial position of obligors whose default-risk rating is greater than or equal to 7.0. This process seeks to minimize an obligor's default risk and allows for proactive credit risk management.\n\n## Validation\n\nThe Risk Management Group monitors the effectiveness of the risk-rating systems and associated parameters, which are also reviewed regularly in accordance with the Bank's policies. Backtesting is performed at regular intervals to validate the effectiveness of the models used to estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. For PD in particular, this backtesting takes the form of sequentially applied measures designed to assess the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the model's discriminatory power;\n- \u00b7 the proportion of overrides;\n- \u00b7 model calibration;\n- \u00b7 the stability of the model's inputs and outputs.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "The credit risk quantification models are developed and tested by a team of specialists and their performance is monitored by the applicable business units and related credit risk management services. Models are validated by a unit that is independent of both the specialists who developed the model and the concerned business units. Approvals of new models or changes to existing models are subject to an escalation process established by the model risk management policy. Furthermore, new models or changes to existing models that markedly impact regulatory capital must be approved by the Board before being submitted to the regulatory agencies.\n\nThe facility and default risk-rating systems, methods and models are also subject to periodic independent validation as often as required given the model's risk level. Models that have a significant impact on regulatory capital must be reviewed regularly, thereby further raising the certainty that these quantification mechanisms are working as expected.\n\nThe key aspects to be validated are risk factors allowing for accurate classification of default risk by level, adequate quantification of exposure, use of assessment  techniques  that  include  external  factors  such  as  economic  conditions  and  credit  status  and,  lastly,  compliance  with  internal  policies  and regulatory provisions.\n\nThe Bank's credit risk assessment and rating systems are overseen by the Models Oversight Committee, the GRC and the RMC, and are an integral part of a comprehensive Bank-wide credit risk oversight framework. Along with the above-mentioned elements, the Bank documents and periodically reviews the policies, definitions of responsibilities, resource allocation and existing processes.\n\n## AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  EEccoonnoommiicc  CCaappiittaall\n\nThe assessment of the Bank's minimum required economic capital is based on the credit risk assessments of debtors. These two activities are therefore interlinked. The different models used to assess the credit risk of a given portfolio type also enable the Bank to determine the default correlation among debtors. This information is a critical component in the evaluation of potential losses for all portfolios carrying credit risk. Estimates of potential losses, whether expected or not, are based on historical loss experience, portfolio monitoring, market data and statistical modelling. Expected and unexpected losses are factors used in assessing the minimum required economic capital for all of the Bank's credit portfolios. The assessment of economic capital also considers the anticipated potential migrations of obligors' default risk rating during the remaining term of their credit commitments. The main risk factors that have an impact on economic capital are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the obligor's PD;\n- \u00b7 the obligor's EAD;\n- \u00b7 the obligor's LGD;\n- \u00b7 the default correlation among various obligors;\n- \u00b7 the residual term of credit commitments;\n- \u00b7 the impact of economic and sector-based cycles on asset quality.\n\n## SSttrreessss  TTeessttiinngg  aanndd  CCrriissiiss  SScceennaarriiooss\n\nThe Bank carries out stress tests to evaluate its sensitivity to crisis situations in certain activity sectors and key portfolios. A global stress test methodology covers most business, government, and personal credit portfolios to provide the Bank with an overview of the situation. By simulating specific scenarios, these tests enable the Bank to measure allowance for credit losses according to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and the level of regulatory capital needed to absorb potential losses and also to determine the impact on its solvency. In addition, these tests contribute to portfolio management as they influence the determination of concentration limits by obligor, product, or business sector.\n\n## CCrreeddiitt--GGrraannttiinngg  PPrroocceessss\n\nCredit-granting decisions are based first and foremost on the results of the risk assessment. Aside from an obligor's solvency, credit-granting decisions are also influenced by factors such as available collateral, transaction compliance with policies, standards and procedures, and the Bank's overall risk-adjusted return objective. Each credit-granting decision is made by authorities within the risk management teams and management who are independent of the business units and are at a reporting level commensurate with the size of the proposed credit transaction and the associated risk.\n\nDecision-making authority is determined in compliance with the delegation of authority set out in the Credit Risk Management Policy. A person in a senior position in the organization approves credit facilities that are substantial or carry a higher risk for the Bank. The GRC approves and monitors all substantial credit facilities. Credit applications that exceed management's latitudes are submitted to the Board for approval. The credit-granting process demands a high level of accountability from managers, who must proactively manage the credit portfolio.\n\n## RReevviieeww  aanndd  RReenneewwaall  PPrroocceesssseess\n\nThe Bank periodically reviews credit files. The review process enables the Bank to update information on the quality of the facilities and covers, among other things, risk ratings, compliance with credit conditions, and obligor behaviour. In the specific case of business credit portfolios, the credit risk of all obligors is reviewed at least once per year. After this periodic review, for on-demand or unused credit, the Bank decides whether to pursue its business relationship with the obligor and, if so, revises the credit conditions. For personal credit portfolios, the credit risk of all obligors is reviewed on a continual basis.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

In addition to the standard practice of requiring collateral to guarantee repayment of the credit it grants, the Bank also uses protection mechanisms such as credit derivative financial instruments, syndication and loan assignments as well as an orderly reduction in the amount of credit granted.\n\nThe most common method used to mitigate credit risk is to obtain quality collateral from obligors. Obtaining collateral cannot replace a rigorous assessment of an obligor's ability to meet its financial obligations, but, beyond a certain risk threshold, it is an essential complement. In certain circumstances, it is not necessary to take collateral. The need to take collateral depends on the level of risk presented by the obligor and the type of loan granted. However, if the level of risk to the Bank is considered high, collateral will likely be required. The legal validity and enforceability of any collateral obtained and the Bank's ability to correctly and regularly measure the collateral's value are critical for this mechanism to play its proper role in risk mitigation.\n\nThe Bank has established specific requirements in its internal policies with respect to the appropriate legal documentation and assessment for the kinds of collateral that business units may require to guarantee the loans granted. The categories of eligible collateral and the lending value of the collateralized assets have also been defined by the Bank. For the most part, they include the following asset categories as well as guarantees (whether secured by collateral or unsecured) and government and bank guarantees:\n\n- \u00b7 accounts receivable;\n- \u00b7 inventories;\n- \u00b7 machinery and equipment and rolling stock;\n- \u00b7 residential and commercial real estate, office buildings and industrial facilities;\n- \u00b7 cash and marketable securities.\n\n## Portfolio Diversification and Management\n\nThe Bank is exposed to credit risk, not only through outstanding loans and undrawn amounts of commitments to a particular obligor but also through the sectoral distribution of the outstanding loans and undrawn amounts and through the exposure of its various credit portfolios to geographical, concentration, and settlement risks.\n\nThe Bank's approach to controlling these diverse risks begins with a diversification of exposures. Measures designed to maintain a healthy degree of diversification of credit risk in its portfolios are set out in the Bank's policies, standards, and procedures. These instructions are mainly reflected in the application of various exposure limits: credit concentration limits by counterparty and credit concentration limits by business sector, country, region, product, and type of financial instrument. These limits are determined based on the Bank's credit risk appetite framework and are reviewed periodically. Compliance with these limits, particularly exceptions, is monitored through periodic reports submitted by the Risk Management Group's officers to the Board.\n\nContinuous analyses are performed in order to anticipate problems with a sector or obligor before they materialize as defaulted payments.\n\n## Other Risk Mitigation Methods\n\nCredit risk mitigation measures for transactions in derivative financial instruments, which are regularly used by the Bank, are described in detail in the Counterparty Risk section.\n\n## Credit Derivative Financial Instruments and Financial Guarantee Contracts\n\nThe Bank also reduces credit risk by using the protection provided by credit derivative financial instruments such as credit default swaps. When the Bank acquires credit protection, it pays a premium on the swap to the counterparty in exchange for the counterparty's commitment to pay if the underlying entity defaults or another event involving the underlying entity and covered by the legal agreement occurs. Since, like obligors, providers of credit protection must receive a default risk rating, the Bank's standards set out all the criteria under which a counterparty may be judged eligible to mitigate the Bank's credit risk. The Bank may also reduce its credit risk by entering into financial guarantee contracts whereby a guarantor indemnifies the Bank for a loss resulting from an obligor failing to make a payment when due in accordance with the contractual terms of a debt instrument.\n\n## Loan Syndication\n\nThe Bank has developed specific instructions on the appropriate objectives, responsibilities and documentation requirements for loan syndication.\n\n## F Foollllooww--UUpp  ooff  MMoonniittoorreedd  AAccccoouunnttss  aanndd  RReeccoovveerryy\n\nCredit granted and obligors are monitored on an ongoing basis and in a manner commensurate with the related risk. Loan portfolio managers use an array of intervention methods to conduct a particularly rigorous follow-up on files that show a high risk of default. When loans continue to deteriorate and there is an increase in risk to the point where monitoring has to be increased, a group specialized in managing problem accounts (Work Out units) steps in to maximize collection of the disbursed amounts and tailor strategies to these accounts.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Each quarter, the Work Out units submit a monitoring report (called a watchlist) to a monitoring committee to track the status of at-risk obligors and the corrective measures undertaken. In addition, files in which the authorized amount is $4 million and up are presented to the Watchlist committee, which in turn reviews the action plans and watchlist reports. The authority to approve allowances for credit losses is attributed using limits delegated on the basis of hierarchical level presented in the Credit Risk Management Policy.\n\nInformation on the recognition of impaired loans and allowances for credit losses is presented in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Forbearance and Restructuring\n\nSituations where a business or retail obligor begins showing clear signs of potential insolvency are managed on a case-by-case basis and require the use of judgment. The Loan Work Out Policy sets out the principles applicable in such situations to guide loan restructuring decisions and identify situations where distressed restructuring applies. A distressed restructuring situation occurs when the Bank, for economic or legal reasons related to the obligor's financial difficulties, grants the obligor a special concession that is contrary to the Bank's policies. Such concessions could include a lower interest rate, waiver of principal, and extension of the maturity date.\n\nThe Bank has established a management framework for commercial and corporate obligors that represent higher-than-normal risk of default. It outlines the roles and responsibilities of loan portfolio managers with respect to managing high-risk accounts and the responsibilities of the Work Out units and other participants in the process. Lastly, the Credit Risk Management Policy and a management framework are used to determine the authorization limits for distressed restructuring situations. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the amount of distressed loan restructurings was not significant.\n\n## C Coouunntteerrppaarrttyy  RRiisskk  AAsssseessssmmeenntt\n\nCounterparty risk is a credit risk that the Bank incurs on various types of transactions involving financial instruments. The most significant risks are those it faces when it trades derivative financial instruments with counterparties on the over-the-counter market or when it purchases securities under reverse repurchase  agreements  or  sells  securities  under  repurchase  agreements.  Securities  lending  transactions  and  securities  brokerage  activities  involving derivative financial instruments are also sources of counterparty risk. Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides a complete description of the credit risk for derivative financial instruments by type of traded product.\n\nThe Risk Management Group has developed models by type of counterparty through which it applies an advanced methodology for calculating the Bank's credit risk exposure and economic capital. The exposures are subject to limits. These limits are established based on the potential volatility of the underlying assets until expiration of the contract.\n\nCounterparty obligations related to the trading of contracts on derivative financial instruments, securities lending transactions  and  reverse  repurchase agreements are frequently subject to credit risk mitigation measures. The mitigation techniques are somewhat different from those used for loans and advances and depend on the nature of the instrument or the type of contract traded. The most widely used measure is the signing of master agreements: the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master agreement, the Global  Master  Repurchase  Agreement  (GMRA)  and  the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement (GMSLA). These agreements make it possible, in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of one of the contracting parties, to apply full netting of the gross amounts of the market values for each of the transactions covered by the agreement in force at the time of default. The amount of the final settlement is therefore the net balance of gains and losses on each transaction, which reduces exposure when a counterparty defaults. The Bank's policies require that an ISDA, GMRA, or GMSLA agreement be signed with its trading counterparties to derivatives, foreign exchange forward contracts, securities lending transactions and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nAnother mechanism for reducing credit risk on derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts complements the ISDA master agreement in many cases and provides the Bank and its counterparty (or either of the parties, if need be) with the right to request collateral from the counterparty when the net balance of gains and losses on each transaction exceeds a threshold defined in the agreement. These agreements, also known as Credit Support Annexes (CSAs), are mandatory when financial institutions trade between each other in international financial markets since they limit credit risk while providing traders with additional flexibility to continue trading with the counterparty. The Bank always, when required by regulation, uses this type of legal documentation in transactions with financial institutions and governments. For business transactions, the Bank prefers to use internal mechanisms set out in the credit agreements. The Bank's internal policies set the conditions governing the implementation of such mitigation methods.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "Requiring collateral as part of a securities lending transaction or reverse repurchase agreement is not solely the result of an internal credit decision. In fact, it is  a  mandatory  market  practice  imposed  by  self-regulating  organizations  in  the  financial  services  sector  such  as  the  Investment  Industry  Regulatory Organization of Canada.\n\nThe Bank has identified circumstances in which it is likely to be exposed to wrong-way risk. There are two types of wrong-way risk: general wrong-way risk and specific wrong-way risk. General wrong-way risk occurs when the probability of default of the counterparties is positively correlated to the general market risk factors. Specific wrong-way risk occurs when the exposure to a specific counterparty is positively correlated to the probability of default of the counterparty due to the nature of the transactions with this counterparty.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSeettttlleemmeenntt  RRiisskk\n\nSettlement risk potentially arises from transactions that feature reciprocal delivery of cash or securities between the Bank and a counterparty. Foreign exchange contracts are an example of transactions that can generate significant levels of settlement risk. However, the implementation of multilateral settlement systems that allow settlement netting among participating institutions has contributed greatly to reducing the risks associated with the settlement of foreign exchange transactions among banks. The Bank also uses financial intermediaries to gain access to established clearing houses in order to minimize settlement risk for certain financial derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank may have direct access to established clearing houses for settling financial transactions such as repurchase agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. In addition, certain derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties. For additional information, see the table that presents notional amounts in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere are several other types of transactions that may generate settlement risk, in particular the use of certain electronic fund transfer services. This risk refers to the possibility that the Bank may make a payment or settlement on a transaction without receiving the amount owed by the counterparty, and with no opportunity to recover the funds delivered (irrevocable settlement).\n\nThe ultimate means for completely eliminating such a risk is for the Bank to complete no payments or settlements before receiving the funds due from the counterparty. Such an approach cannot, however, be used systematically. For several electronic payment services, the Bank is able to implement mechanisms that allow it to make its transfers revocable or to debit the counterparty in the amount of the settlements before it makes its own transfer. On the other hand, the nature of transactions in financial instruments makes it impossible for such practices to be widely used. For example, on foreign exchange transactions involving a currency other than the U.S. dollar, time zone differentials impose strict payment schedules on the parties. The Bank cannot unduly postpone a settlement without facing penalties, due to the large size of amounts involved.\n\nThe most effective way for the Bank to control settlement risks, both for financial market transactions and irrevocable transfers, is to impose internal risk limits based on the counterparty's ability to pay.\n\n## AAsssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  EEnnvviirroonnmmeennttaall  RRiisskk\n\nEnvironmental risk can affect credit risk in that the energy transition movement and extreme weather events could result in a decreased ability to make repayments or in a decrease in the value of assets pledged as collateral. Ultimately, environmental risk can lead to both a higher probability of default and higher loss given default among counterparties. In response, the risk management framework has been expanded to include new measures that identify, assess, control, and monitor environmental risk. In addition, the Bank has developed and is gradually deploying a process used to assess and quantify the impact of climate changes on its strategy and results. Furthermore, for clients in specific industries, the impacts of climate changes are discussed at least once a year as part of the credit granting or renewal process.\n\nThe Bank also assesses its exposure to environment-related credit risk using a variety of control and monitoring mechanisms. For example, analyses are performed on vulnerabilities to physical risks and on loan portfolio transition risks. These analyses are applied to all financing activities and provide greater visibility of the Bank's exposure to environmental risk. In addition, the Bank periodically assesses loan portfolio concentration risk to ensure that this risk is not being significantly affected by environmental risk. Furthermore, an industry sector matrix has been developed to provide the Risk Management group with a clearer vision of the loan portfolio sectors that are most affected by climate-related risks. Thanks to these initiatives, the Bank has been able to take concrete steps in the process used to review sectoral limits, as each business sector or industry now has an ESG section describing its environmental risk.\n\nThe Risk Management group closely monitors changes in trends and calculation methods and participates actively in various industry discussion groups.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## M Maarrkkeett  RRiisskk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of losses arising from movements in market prices. Market risk comes from a number of factors, particularly changes to market variables such as interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and implied volatilities. The Bank is exposed to market risk through its participation in trading, investment and asset/liability management activities. Trading activities involve taking positions, on various instruments such as bonds,  shares,  currencies,  commodities  or  derivative  financial  instruments.  The  Bank  is  exposed  to  non-trading  market  risk  through  its  asset/liability management and investment portfolios.\n\nAt its onset, the COVID-19 pandemic sent stock markets into sharp decline and rendered them more volatile, pushed interest rates downwards, triggered a rapid and sudden rise in unemployment, and prompted an economic slowdown. In spring 2020, governments, monetary authorities, and regulators intervened to support the economy and the financial system, notably by deploying fiscal and monetary measures designed to increase liquidity and support incomes. Although the global economy recovered during fiscal 2021, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists, in particular through subsequent waves, its impacts on the global economy could worsen, and the measures in place might not be sufficient over the long term to completely avoid recessionary conditions.\n\nThe trading portfolios include positions in financial instruments and commodities held either with trading intent or to hedge other elements of the trading book. Positions held with trading intent are those held for short-term resale and/or with the intent of taking advantage of actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. These portfolios target one of the following objectives: market making, liquidating positions for clients or selling financial products to clients.\n\nNon-trading portfolios include financial instruments intended to be held to maturity as well as those held for daily cash management or for the purpose of maintaining targeted returns or ensuring asset and liability management.\n\n## G Goovveerrnnaannccee\n\nA market risk management policy governs global market risk management across the Bank's units and subsidiaries that are exposed to this type of risk. It is approved by the GRC. The policy sets out the principles for managing market risk and the framework that defines risk measures, control and monitoring activities; sets market risk limits; and reports on breaches.\n\nThe Financial Markets Risk Committee oversees all Financial Markets segment risks that could adversely affect the Bank's results, liquidity, or capital. This committee also oversees the Financial Markets segment's risk framework to ensure that controls are in place to contain risk in accordance with the Bank's risk appetite framework.\n\nMarket risk limits ensure the link and coherence between the Bank's market risk appetite targets and the day-to-day market risk management by all parties involved, notably senior management, business lines and market risk sector in its independent control function. The Bank's monitoring and reporting process consists of comparing market risk exposure to alert levels and market risk limits determined for all limit authorization and approval levels.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk\n\nThe Risk Management Group uses a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses under more or less severe scenarios, and using both shortterm and long-term time horizons. For short-term horizons, the Bank's risk measures include Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR), and sensitivity metrics. For long-term horizons or sudden significant market moves, including those due to a lack of market liquidity, the risk measures include stress testing across an extensive range of scenarios.\n\n## VaR and SVaR Models\n\nVaR is a statistical measure of risk that is used to quantify market risks by activity and by risk type. VaR is defined as the maximum loss at a specific confidence level over a certain horizon under normal market conditions. The VaR method has the advantage of providing a uniform measurement of financial instrumentrelated market risks based on a single statistical confidence level and time horizon.\n\nFor VaR, the Bank uses a historical price distribution to compute the probable loss levels at the 99% confidence level, using a two-year history of daily time series of risk factor changes. VaR is the maximum daily loss the Bank could incur, in 99 cases out of 100, in a given portfolio. In other words, the loss could exceed that amount in only one out of 100 cases.\n\nThe trading VaR is measured by assuming a holding period of one day for ongoing market risk management and a 10-day holding period for regulatory capital purposes. VaR is calculated on a daily basis both for major classes of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) and all trading portfolios in the Financial Markets segment and the Bank's Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nIn addition to the one-day trading VaR, the Bank calculates a trading SVaR, which is a statistical measure of risk that replicates the VaR calculation method but uses, instead of a two-year history of risk factor changes, a 12-month data period corresponding to a continuous period of significant financial stress that is relevant in terms of the Bank's portfolios.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "VaR methodology techniques are well suited to measure risks under normal market conditions. VaR metrics are most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets. However, there are limitations in measuring risks with this method when extreme and sudden market risk events occur, since they are likely to underestimate the Bank's market risk. VaR methodology limitations include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 past changes in market risk factors may not always produce accurate predictions of the distribution and correlations of future market movements;\n- \uf0b7 a VaR with a daily time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day;\n- \uf0b7 the market risk factor historical database used for VaR calculation may not reflect potential losses that could occur under unusual market conditions (e.g., periods of extreme illiquidity) relative to the historical period used for VaR estimates;\n- \uf0b7 the use of a 99% VaR confidence level does not reflect the extent of potential losses beyond that percentile.\n\nGiven the limitations of VaR, this measure represents only one component of the Bank's risk management oversight, which also incorporates, among other measures, stress testing, sensitivity analysis, concentration and liquidity limits and analysis.\n\nThe Bank also conducts backtesting of the VaR model. It consists of comparing the profits and losses to the statistical VaR measure. Backtesting is essential to verifying the VaR model's capacity to adequately forecast the maximum risk of market losses and thus validate, retroactively, the quality and accuracy of the results obtained using the model. If the backtesting results present material discrepancies, the VaR model could be revised in accordance with the Bank's model risk management framework. All market risk models and their performance are subject to periodic independent validation by the model vetting group.\n\n## CCoonnttrroolllliinngg  MMaarrkkeett  RRiisskk\n\nA comprehensive set of limits is applied to measures of market risk, and these limits are monitored and reported on a regular basis. Instances when limits are exceeded are reported to the appropriate management level. The risk profiles of the Bank's operations remain consistent with its risk appetite and the resulting limits, and are monitored and reported to traders, management of the applicable business unit, senior executives, and Board committees.\n\nThe Bank also uses economic capital for market risk as an indicator for risk appetite and limits setting. This indicator measures the amount of capital that is required to absorb unexpected losses due to market risk events over a one-year horizon and with a determined confidence level. For additional information on economic capital, see the Capital Management section of this MD&A.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This technique enhances transparency by exploring a range of severe but plausible events.\n\nThese crises scenarios simulate the results that the portfolios would generate if the extreme events in question were to occur. The Bank's stress testing framework, which is applied to all positions generating market risk, currently comprises the following categories of stress test scenarios:\n\n- \uf0b7 Historical scenarios based on past major disruption situations\n- \uf0b7 Hypothetical scenarios designed to be forward-looking in the face of potential market stresses\n- \uf0b7 Scenarios specific to asset classes, including:\n- o sharp parallel increases/decreases in interest rates; non-parallel movements of interest rates (flattening and steepening) and increases/decreases in credit spreads;\n- o sharp stock market crash coupled with a significant increase in volatility of the term structure; increase in stock prices combined with less volatility;\n- o significant increases/decreases in commodity prices coupled with increases/decreases in volatility; short-term and long-term increases/decreases in commodity prices;\n- o depreciation/appreciation of the U.S. dollar and of other currencies relative to the Canadian dollar.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  IInntteerreesstt  RRaattee  RRiisskk\n\nAs part of its core banking activities, such as lending and deposit taking, the Bank is exposed to interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the potential negative impact of interest rate fluctuations on the Bank's annual net interest income and economic value of equity. Activities related to hedging, investments and term funding are also exposed to structural interest rate risk. The Bank's main exposure to interest rate risk stems from a variety of sources:\n\n- \uf0b7 yield curve risk, which refers to changes in the level, slope, and shape of the yield curve;\n- \uf0b7 repricing risk, which arises from timing differences in the maturity and repricing of on- and off-balance-sheet items;\n- \uf0b7 options risk, either implicit (e.g., prepayment of mortgage loans) or explicit (e.g., capped mortgages and rate guarantees) in balance sheet products;\n- \uf0b7 basis risk that is caused by imperfect correlation between different yield curves.\n\nThe Bank's exposure to structural interest rate risk is assessed and controlled mostly through the impact of stress scenarios and market shocks on the economic value of the Bank's equity and on 12-month net interest income projections. These metrics are based on cash flow projections prepared using a number of assumptions. Specifically, the Bank has developed key assumptions on loan prepayment levels, deposit redemptions, and the behaviour of customers that were granted rate guarantees. These specific assumptions were developed based on historical analyses and are reviewed frequently.\n\nFunds transfer pricing is a process by which the Bank's business units are charged or paid according to their use or supply of funding. Through this mechanism, all funding activities as well as the interest rate risk and liquidity risk associated with those activities are centralized in the Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nActive management of structural interest rate risk can significantly enhance the Bank's profitability and add to shareholder value. The Bank's goal is to maximize its economic value of equity and annual net interest income considering its risk appetite. This has to be accomplished within prescribed risk limits and is done primarily by implementing a policy framework, approved by the GRC and submitted for information purposes to the RMC, which establishes a risk tolerance threshold, monitoring structures controlled by the various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities, and segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding plan that incorporates the expected growth of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Governance\n\nManagement of the Bank's structural interest rate risk is mandated to the Global Funding and Treasury Group. In this role, the executives and personnel of this group are responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks inherent to structural interest rate risk hedging decisions and operations. They act as the primary effective challenge function with respect to the execution of these activities. The GRC approves and endorses the structural interest rate exposure and strategies on the recommendation of the Global Funding and Treasury Group. The Risk Management Group is responsible for assessing structural interest rate risk, monitoring activities, and ensuring compliance with the interest rate risk in the banking book policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that an appropriate  risk  management  framework  is  in  place  and  ensures  compliance  with  the  risk  appetite  framework  and  policy.  Structural  interest  rate  risk supervision is mainly provided by the Financial Markets Risk Committee. This committee reviews exposure to structural interest rate risk, the use of limits, and changes made to assumptions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Crisis scenarios are performed where the yield curve level, slope and shape are shocked. Yield curve basis and volatility scenarios are also performed. All risk factors mentioned above are covered by specific scenarios and have Board-approved or GRC-approved risk limits.\n\nDynamic simulation is also used to project the Bank's future net interest income, future economic value, and future structural interest rate risk exposure. These simulations  project  cash  flows  of  assets,  liabilities  and  off-balance-sheet  products  over  a  given  investment  horizon.  Given  their  dynamic  nature,  they encompass assumptions pertaining to changes in volume, client term preference, prepayments of deposits and loans, and the yield curve.\n\nThe following table presents the potential before-tax impact of an immediate and sustained 100-basis-point increase or of an immediate and sustained 25 basis-point decrease in interest rates on the economic value of equity and on the net interest income of the Bank's non-trading portfolios for the next 12 months, assuming no further hedging is undertaken. In the current environment of very low interest rates, the Bank believes that a sensitivity analysis reflecting an immediate and sustained 25-basis-point decrease in interest rates provides more relevant information.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  RRaattee  SSeennssiittiivviittyy  --  NNoonn--TTrraaddiinngg  AAccttiivviittiieess  ((BBeeffoorree  TTaaxx))**\n\nAs at October 31\n\n| (millions of Canadian dollars)                              | 2002211                           | 2002211                             | 2002211     | 2020 (1)         | 2020 (1)          | 2020 (1)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|\n|                                                             | C Caannaaddiiaann   d doollllaarr | O Otthheerr   c cuurrrreenncciieess | T Toottaall | Canadian  dollar | Other  currencies | Total      |\n| I Immppaacctt  oonn  eeqquuiittyy                           |                                   |                                     |             |                  |                   |            |\n| 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate               | ( (227777))                       | 3 399                               | ( (223388)) | (239)            | 15                | (224)      |\n| 25-basis-point decrease in the interest rate                | 6 677                             | ( (99))                             | 5 588       | 49               | (4)               | 45         |\n| I Immppaacctt  oonn  nneett  iinntteerreesstt  iinnccoommee |                                   |                                     |             |                  |                   |            |\n| 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate               | 9 911                             | 1 177                               | 1 10088     | 175              | 7                 | 182        |\n| 25-basis-point decrease in the interest rate                | ( (3322))                         | ( (44))                             | ( (3366))   | (56)             | (2)               | (58)       |\n\n## I Innvveessttmmeenntt  GGoovveerrnnaannccee\n\nThe Bank has created securities portfolios in liquid and less liquid securities for strategic, long-term investment and liquidity management purposes. These investments carry market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and concentration risk.\n\nThe investment governance sets out the guiding principles and general management standards that must be followed by all those who manage portfolios of these securities included in the portfolios of the Bank and its subsidiaries. Under this investment governance, business units that are active in managing these types of portfolios must adopt internal investment policies that set, among other things, targets and limits for the allocation of assets in the portfolios concerned and internal approval mechanisms. The primary objective is to reduce concentration risk by industry, issuer, country, type of financial instrument and credit quality.\n\nOverall limits in value and in proportion to the Bank's equity are set on the outstanding amount of liquid preferred shares, liquid equity securities excluding preferred shares, and instruments classified as illiquid securities in the securities portfolios. The overall exposure to common shares with respect to an individual issuer and the total outstanding amount invested in private equity funds, for investment banking services, are also subject to limits. Restrictions are also set on investments defined as special. Lastly, the Bank has a specific policy, approved by the RMC, applicable to investments in debt and equity securities, including strategic investments. Strategic investments are defined as purchases of business assets or acquisitions of significant interests in an entity for purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurraall  FFoorreeiiggnn  EExxcchhaannggee  RRiisskk\n\nThe Bank's structural foreign exchange risk arises from investments in foreign operations denominated in currencies other than the Canadian dollar. This risk, predominantly in U.S. dollars, is measured by assessing the impact of currency fluctuations on retained earnings. The Bank uses financial instruments (derivative and non-derivative) to hedge this risk. An adverse change in foreign exchange rates can also impact the Bank's capital ratios due to the amount of RWA denominated in a foreign currency. When the Canadian dollar depreciates relative to other currencies, unrealized translation gains on the Bank's net investments in foreign operations, as well as the impact on hedging transactions, are reported in other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. In addition, the Canadian-dollar equivalent of U.S.-dollar-denominated RWA and regulatory capital deductions increases. The reverse is true when the Canadian dollar appreciates relative to the U.S. dollar. The structural foreign exchange risk is managed to ensure that the potential impacts on the capital ratios and net income are within tolerable limits set by risk policies.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Liquidity and funding risk arises when sources of funds become insufficient to meet scheduled payments under the Bank's commitments. Liquidity risk stems from mismatched cash flows related to assets and liabilities as well as the characteristics of certain products such as credit commitments and nonfixed-term deposits.\n\nThe Bank's primary objective as a financial institution is to manage liquidity such that it supports the Bank's business strategy and allows it to honour its commitments when they come due, even in extreme conditions. This is done primarily by implementing a policy framework approved by the RMC, which establishes a risk appetite, monitoring structures controlled by various committees, risk indicators, reporting procedures, delegation of responsibilities and segregation of duties. The Bank also prepares an annual funding plan that incorporates the expected growth of assets and liabilities.\n\n## Regulatory Environment\n\nThe Bank works closely with national and international regulators to implement regulatory liquidity standards. The Bank adapts its processes and policies to reflect its liquidity risk appetite towards these new requirements.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 impact and to support the financial and operational resilience of financial institutions, the Bank of Canada and OSFI took exceptional measures in the second quarter of 2020. During fiscal 2021, given that the financial and economic risks caused by the pandemic were tempered somewhat, most of the relief measures were lifted. For additional information, see the section entitled COVID-19 Pandemic - Key Measures Introduced by the Regulatory Authorities on pages 17 and 18 of this MD&A.\n\nThe Liquidity Adequacy Requirements (LAR) are reviewed annually to reflect domestic and international regulatory changes. They constitute OSFI's proposed liquidity framework and include six chapters:\n\n- \uf0b7 overview;\n- \uf0b7 liquidity coverage ratio (LCR);\n- \uf0b7 net stable funding ratio (NSFR);\n- \uf0b7 net cumulative cash flow (NCCF);\n- \uf0b7 liquidity monitoring tools;\n- \uf0b7 intraday liquidity monitoring tools.\n\nThe LCR is used to ensure that banks can overcome severe short-term stress, while the NSFR is a structural ratio over a one-year horizon. The NCCF metric is defined as a monitoring tool that calculates a survival period. It is based on the assumptions of a stress scenario prescribed by OSFI that aims to represent a combined systemic and bank-specific crisis. The Bank publishes LCR on a quarterly basis. Since January 2021, the NSFR has also been published quarterly in accordance with OSFI's revised guideline, Net Stable Funding Ratio Disclosure Requirements, which took effect on January 1, 2021. This guideline sets out NSFR ratio disclosure requirements for D-SIBs.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, OSFI released, for public consultation, revisions to its LAR guideline, which was to take effect in the first quarter of 2023. OSFI is making changes that will improve the sensitivity to risk and that will ensure that financial institutions hold sufficient cash or other liquid investments to meet potential liquidity needs and to support the continued lending of credit, in particular during periods of financial stress. On November 29, 2021, OSFI postponed the implementation of the revisions to its LAR guideline to April 1, 2023.\n\nThe Bank continues to closely monitor regulatory developments and actively participates in various consultation processes.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Although the day-to-day and strategic management of risks associated with liquidity, funding and pledging activities is assumed by the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Risk Management Group is responsible for assessing liquidity risk and overseeing compliance with the resulting policy. The Risk Management Group ensures that an appropriate risk management framework is in place and ensures compliance with the risk appetite framework. This structure provides an independent oversight and effective challenge for the liquidity, funding and pledging decisions, strategy, and exposure.\n\nThe Bank's Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance Policy requires review and approval by the RMC, based on recommendations from the GRC. The Bank has established three levels of limits. The first two levels of limits involve the Bank's overall cash position and are respectively approved by the Board and the GRC, whereas the third level of limits focuses more on specific aspects of liquidity risk and is approved by the Financial Markets Risk Committee. The Board not only approves the supervision of day-to-day risk management and governance but also backup plans in anticipation of emergency and liquidity crisis situations. If a limit has to be revised, the Risk Management Group with the support of the Global Funding and Treasury Group, submits the proposed revision to the approving committee.\n\nOversight of liquidity risk is entrusted mainly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee, whose members include representatives of the Financial Markets segment, the Global Funding and Treasury Group and the Risk Management Group.\n\nThe Bank also has policies and guidelines governing its own collateral pledged to counterparties, given the potential impact of such asset transfers on its liquidity. In accordance with its Liquidity, Funding & Pledging Policy, the Bank conducts simulations of potential counterparty collateral claims under the CSAs in effect in the event of a Bank downgrade or other unlikely occurrences. The simulations are based on various Bank downgrading scenarios or market value fluctuations of transactions covered by CSAs.\n\nThrough the Financial Markets Risk Committee, the Risk Management Group regularly reports changes in liquidity, funding and pledging indicators and compliance with regulatory, Board, and GRC approved limits. If control reports indicate non-compliance with the limits and, generally, deterioration of liquidity indicators,  the  Global  Funding  and  Treasury  Group  takes  remedial  action.  According  to  the  escalation  process,  problematic  situations  are  reported  to management and to the GRC and the RMC. An executive report on the Bank's liquidity and funding risk management, which describes the Bank's liquidity position and informs the Board of non-compliance with the limits and other rules observed during the reference period as well as remedial action taken, is submitted quarterly to the RMC.\n\n## LLiiqquuiiddiittyy  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nThe Bank performs liquidity management, funding and pledging operations not only from its head office and regional offices in Canada, but also through certain foreign centres. Although the volume of such operations abroad represents a sizable portion of global liquidity management, the Bank's liquidity management is centralized. By organizing liquidity management, funding and pledging activities within the Global Funding and Treasury Group, the Bank can better coordinate enterprise-wide funding and risk monitoring activities. All internal funding transactions between Bank entities are controlled by the Global Funding and Treasury Group.\n\nThis centralized structure streamlines the allocation and control of liquidity management, funding and pledging limits. Nonetheless, the Liquidity, Funding and Pledging Governance policy contains special provisions for the financial centres that are most active in terms of institutional funding and sets limits and monitoring thresholds for secured and unsecured short-term funding, both in absolute value and materiality.\n\nThe Bank's funds transfer pricing system prices liquidity by allocating the cost or income to the various business segments. Liquidity costs are allocated to liquidity-intensive activities, mainly long-term loans, and commitments to extend credit and less liquid securities as well as strategic investments. The liquidity compensation is credited to the suppliers of funds, primarily funding in the form of stable deposits from the Bank's distribution network.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Among these ratios and metrics, the Bank pays particular attention to the funds obtained on the wholesale market and to cumulative cash flows over various time horizons.\n\nMoreover, the Bank's collateral pledging activities are monitored in relation to the different limits set by the Bank and are subject to monthly stress tests using simulations. In particular, the Bank uses various scenarios to estimate the potential amounts of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a downgrade to the Bank's credit rating.\n\nLiquidity risk can be assessed in many different ways using different liquidity indicators. One of the key monitoring tools of liquidity risk is the Bank's survival period based on contractual maturity and behavioural assumptions applied to balance sheet items as well as off-balance-sheet commitments.\n\n## Stress Testing and Crisis Scenarios\n\nUsing various simulations, survival period measures the number of months it would take to completely utilize the Bank's liquid assets if the Bank were to lose deposits prematurely or if funds from wholesale markets were not renewed at maturity. It is measured monthly using three scenarios, which were developed to assess sensitivity to a Bank-specific and/or systemic crisis. Deposit loss simulations are carried out based on their degree of stability, while the value of certain assets is encumbered by an amount reflecting their readiness for liquidation in a crisis. Appropriate scenarios and limits are included in the Bank's liquidity, funding, and pledging governance policy.\n\nThe Bank maintains an up-to-date, comprehensive financial contingency and crisis recovery plan that describes the measures to be taken in the event of a critical liquidity situation. This plan is reviewed and approved annually by the Board as part of business continuity and recovery planning. For additional information, see the Regulatory Compliance Risk section of this MD&A.\n\n## Liquidity Risk Appetite\n\nThe Bank monitors and manages its risk appetite through liquidity limits, ratios and stress tests. The Bank's liquidity risk appetite is based on the following three principles:\n\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank has a sufficient amount of unencumbered liquid assets to cover its financial requirements, in both normal and stressed conditions;\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank keeps a liquidity buffer above the minimum regulatory requirement;\n- \uf0b7 ensure the Bank maintains diversified and stable sources of funding.\n\n## Liquid Assets\n\nTo protect depositors and creditors from unexpected crisis situations, the Bank holds a portfolio of unencumbered liquid assets that can be readily liquidated to meet financial obligations. The majority of unencumbered liquid assets are held in Canadian or U.S. dollars. Moreover, all assets that can be quickly monetized are considered liquid assets. The Bank's liquidity reserves do not factor in the availability of the central bank's emergency liquidity facilities. The following tables provide information on the Bank's encumbered and unencumbered assets.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Encumbered assets include assets used to cover short sales, obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned, guarantees related to security-backed loans and borrowings, collateral related to derivative financial instrument transactions, asset-backed securities, residential mortgage loans securitized and transferred under the Canada Mortgage Bond program, assets held in consolidated trusts supporting the Bank's funding activities, and mortgage loans transferred under the covered bond program.\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was introduced primarily to ensure that banks could withstand periods of severe short-term stress. LCR is calculated by dividing the total amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) by the total amount of net cash outflows. OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. An LCR above 100% ensures that banks are holding sufficient high-quality liquid assets to cover net cash outflows given a severe, 30day liquidity crisis. The assumptions underlying the LCR scenario were established by the BCBS and OSFI's Liquidity Adequacy Requirements guideline.\n\nThe following table provides average LCR data calculated using the daily figures in the quarter. For the quarter ended October 31, 2021, the Bank's average LCR was 154%, well above the 100% regulatory requirement and demonstrating the Bank's solid liquidity position.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

includes cash, central bank deposits, and bonds issued or guaranteed by the Canadian government and Canadian provincial governments. Cash outflows arise from the application of OSFI-prescribed assumptions on deposits, debt, secured funding, commitments and additional collateral requirements. The cash outflows are partly offset by cash inflows, which come mainly from secured loans and performing loans. The Bank expects some quarter-over-quarter variation between reported LCRs, and such variation may not be indicative of a trend. The variation between the quarter ended October 31, 2021 and the preceding quarter are a result of normal business operations. The Bank's liquid asset buffer is well in excess of its total net cash outflows.\n\nThe LCR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures presented in the tables on the previous pages or those used for internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework is prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank's internal liquidity metrics use assumptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.\n\n## Intraday Liquidity\n\nThe Bank manages its intraday liquidity in such a way that the amount of available liquidity exceeds its maximum intraday liquidity requirements. The Bank monitors its intraday liquidity on an hourly basis, and the evolution thereof is presented monthly to the Financial Markets Risk Committee.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nThe BCBS has developed the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to promote a more resilient banking sector. The NSFR requires institutions to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance-sheet activities. A viable funding structure is intended to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to an institution's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position in a way that would increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. NSFR is calculated by dividing available stable funding by required stable funding. OSFI has been requiring Canadian banks to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "The NSFR represents the amount of ASF relative to the amount of RSF. ASF is defined as the portion of capital and liabilities expected to be reliable over the time horizon considered by the NSFR, which extends to one year. The amount of RSF of a specific institution is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of the various assets held by that institution as well as those of its off-balance-sheet exposures. The amounts of available and required stable funding are calibrated to reflect the degree of stability of liabilities and liquidity of assets. The Bank expects some quarter-over-quarter variation between reported NSFRs, and such variation may not be indicative of a trend.\n\nThe NSFR assumptions differ from the assumptions used for the liquidity disclosures provided in the tables on the preceding pages or those used for internal liquidity management rules. While the liquidity disclosure framework is prescribed by the EDTF, the Bank's internal liquidity metrics use assumptions that are calibrated according to its business model and experience.\n\n## F Fuunnddiinngg  RRiisskk\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk to the Bank's ongoing ability to raise sufficient funds to finance actual or proposed business activities on an unsecured or secured basis at an acceptable price. The Bank maintains a good balance of its funding through appropriate diversification of its unsecured funding vehicles, securitization programs and secured funding. The Bank also diversifies its funding by currency, geography, and maturity. The funding management priority is to achieve an optimal balance between deposits, securitization, secured funding and unsecured funding. This brings optimal stability to the funding and reduces vulnerability to unpredictable events.\n\nFunding and liquidity levels remained sound and robust over the year and the Bank does not foresee any event, commitment or demand that might have a significant impact on its funding and liquidity risk position. For additional information, see the table entitled Residual Contractual Maturities of Balance Sheet Items and Off-Balance-Sheet Commitments in Note 29 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nThe credit ratings assigned by ratings agencies represent their assessment of the Bank's credit quality based on qualitative and quantitative information provided to them. Credit ratings may be revised at any time based on various factors, including macroeconomic factors, methodologies used by ratings agencies, or the current and projected financial condition of the Bank. Credit ratings are one of the main factors that influence the Bank's ability to access financial markets at a reasonable cost. A downgrade in the Bank's credit ratings could adversely affect the cost, size and term of future funding and could also result in increased requirement to pledge collateral or decreased capacity to engage in certain collateralized business activities at a reasonable cost, including hedging and derivatives transactions.\n\nFunding and liquidity levels remain sound and robust, and the Bank continues to enjoy excellent access to the market for its funding needs. The Bank received favourable credit ratings from all the agencies, reflecting the high quality of its debt instruments, and the Bank's objective is to maintain these strong credit ratings. On January 13, 2021, Fitch Ratings changed the trend on all the Bank's ratings and its related entities from 'Negative' to 'Stable.'

Operational risk exists for every Bank activity. Theft, fraud, cyberattacks, unauthorized transactions, system errors, human error, amendments to or misinterpretation of laws and regulations, litigation or disputes with clients, inappropriate sales practice behaviour or property damage are just a few examples of events likely to cause financial loss, harm the Bank's reputation, or lead to regulatory penalties or sanctions.\n\nAlthough operational risk cannot be eliminated entirely, it can be managed in a thorough and transparent manner to keep it at an acceptable level. The Bank's operational risk management framework is built on the concept of three lines of defence and provides a clear allocation of responsibilities to all levels of the organization, as mentioned below.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk\n\nThe operational risk management framework is described in the Operational Risk Management Policy, which is derived from the Risk Management Policy. The operational risk management framework is aligned with the Bank's risk appetite and is made up of policies, standards, and procedures specific to each operational risk, which fall under the responsibility of specialized groups.\n\nThe segments use several operational risk management tools and methods to identify, assess, and manage their operational risks and control measures. With these tools and methods, the segments can:\n\n- \uf0b7 recognize and understand the inherent and residual risks to which their activities and operations are exposed;\n- \uf0b7 identify how to manage and monitor the identified risks to keep them at an acceptable level;\n- \uf0b7 proactively and continuously manage risks.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt  TToooollss  aanndd  MMeetthhooddss\n\n## Collection and Analysis of Data on Operational Events\n\nThe Operational Risk Unit applies a process, across the Bank and its subsidiaries, for identifying, collecting and analyzing data on internal operational events. This process includes determining the Bank's exposure to the operational risks and operational losses incurred and assessing the effectiveness of internal controls. It also helps limit operational events, keep losses at an acceptable level and, as a result, reduce potential capital charges and lower the likelihood of damage to the Bank's reputation. These data are processed and saved in a centralized database and are periodically the subject of a quality assurance exercise.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

As such, the program makes it possible to anticipate certain factors that could hinder performance or the achievement of objectives.\n\n## Key Risk Indicators\n\nKey risk indicators are used to monitor the drivers of exposure to major operational risks and track changes in risks to proactively manage them. The business units and corporate units define key indicators associated with their main operational risks and assign tolerance thresholds to them. These indicators are monitored periodically, and when they show a significant increase in risk or when a tolerance threshold is exceeded, they are sent to the appropriate level in the hierarchy and action plans are implemented as required.\n\n## Scenario Analysis\n\nScenario analysis, which is part of a Bank-wide stress testing program, is an important and useful tool for assessing the impacts related to potentially serious events. It is used to define the risk appetite, set risk exposure limits, and engage in business planning. More specifically, scenario analysis provides management  with  a  better  understanding  of  the  risks  faced  by  the  Bank,  and  helps  it  make  appropriate  management  decisions  to  mitigate  potential operational risks that are inconsistent with the Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## Insurance Program\n\nIn order to protect itself against any material losses related to its exposure to unforeseeable operational risks, the Bank also has adequate insurance, the nature and amount of which meet its coverage requirements.\n\n## O Oppeerraattiioonnaall  RRiisskk  RReeppoorrttss  aanndd  DDiisscclloossuurreess\n\nOperational events for which the financial impact exceeds the tolerance thresholds or that have a significant regulatory or reputation impact are submitted to the decision-making levels concerned. Management is obligated to report on its management process and to remain alert to current and future issues. Reports on the Bank's risk profile, highlights, and emerging risks are periodically submitted, on a timely basis, to the Operational Risk Management Committee, the GRC and the RMC. This reporting enhances the transparency and proactive management of the main operational risk factors.\n\n## R Reegguullaattoorryy  CCoommpplliiaannccee  RRiisskk\n\nRegulatory compliance risk is the risk of the Bank or of one of its employees or business partners failing to comply with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally. Regulatory compliance risk is present in all of the daily operations of each Bank segment. A situation of regulatory non-compliance can adversely affect the Bank's reputation and result in penalties and sanctions or increased oversight by regulators.\n\n## O Orrggaanniizzaattiioonnaall  SSttrruuccttuurree  ooff  CCoommpplliiaannccee\n\nCompliance is an independent oversight function within the Bank.

She is responsible for implementing and updating the Bank's programs for regulatory compliance management, regulatory requirements related to AML/ATF, international sanctions, and the fight against corruption. The CCO and CAMLO has a direct reporting relationship with the Chair of the RMC and meets with him at least once every quarter. She can also communicate directly with senior management, officers and directors of the Bank and of its subsidiaries and foreign centres.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

To ensure sound management of regulatory compliance, the Bank favours proactive approaches and incorporates regulatory requirements into its day-to-day operations.\n\nSuch proactive management also provides reasonable assurance that the Bank is in compliance, in all material respects, with the regulatory requirements in effect where it does business, both in Canada and internationally.\n\nThe implementation of a regulatory compliance risk management framework across the Bank is entrusted to the Compliance Service, which has the following mandate:\n\n- \uf0b7 make sure that policies and standards that ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements are in effect, including those related to AML/ATF, to international sanctions, and to the fight against corruption;\n- \uf0b7 develop compliance and AML/ATF training programs for Bank employees, officers, and directors;\n- \uf0b7 exercise independent oversight and monitor the programs, policies, and procedures implemented by the management of the Bank, its subsidiaries, and its foreign centres to ensure that the control mechanisms are sufficient, respected, and effective;\n- \uf0b7 report relevant compliance and AML/ATF matters to the Bank's Board and inform it of any significant changes in the effectiveness of the Bank's risk management framework.\n\nThe Bank holds itself to high regulatory compliance risk management standards in order to earn the trust of its clients, its shareholders, the market and the general public.\n\nDescribed below are the main regulatory developments that have been monitored over the past year.\n\n## Reform of the Official Languages Act\n\nBill C-32, which amends the Official Languages Act, was tabled on June 15, 2021 and is designed to further protect the French language and foster substantive equality between the two official languages of Canada (French and English). Federally regulated businesses, such as the Bank, will be required to comply with this Act. The reform includes the right of Francophone employees to work in French as well as consumers to be served in French. The Act will apply in Quebec and in regions with a strong Francophone presence (pending a definition). It will also protect the rights of English-speaking minorities.\n\n## Bill 96 (Quebec) (An Act respecting French, the official and common language of Quebec)\n\nOn May 13, 2021, the Quebec government tabled Bill 96 and published amendments to the Charter of the French Language, making it more exacting and empowering it to apply stricter penalties. The objectives of the Act are, in particular, to strengthen the presence and use of the French language in Quebec, to establish a new Charter of the French Language, and to affirm that the only official language of Quebec is French. The major themes addressed by the Act are the Francization committee, labour and employment law, contracts and consumer rights, signs and posters, remedial measures, and penalties.\n\n## Bill 18 - Protection of Vulnerable Persons\n\nThe main purpose of Bill 18, An Act to Amend the Civil Code, Code of Civil Procedure, the Public Curator Act and various provisions as regards the protection of persons, is to amend the legislative provisions in place to protect incapable persons and to put an end to curatorships and advisor mandates to persons of full age. Tutorships to persons of full age shall remain in place, but it will be possible to modulate them based on the incapacity level of the person of full age. Bill 18 has also introduced the concepts of temporary representation and of assistant to persons of full age.\n\n## Consumer Protection\n\nSeveral regulatory changes came into effect this past year, such as the Code of Conduct for the Delivery of Banking Services to Seniors. Other changes will soon come into force, including Bill C-86 and its regulations, which amend the Bank Act (Canada). The purpose of these regulatory changes is to ensure that consumers are protected by way of enhanced disclosures, assessments of the appropriateness of products and services, employee training, and procedures related to the processing of complaints.\n\n## Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) Activities\n\nAmendments made to the regulations under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act announced in the Canada Gazette in July 2019 and June 2020 came into force on June 1, 2021, with the exception of certain requirements related to representations that are expected to take effect in 2023-2024.\n\n## Protection of Personal Information\n\nGiven changing technologies and societal behaviours, privacy and the protection of personal information is a topical issue in Canada. Recent regulatory measures (such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe in 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act in the United States in 2020) reflect a desire to implement a stronger legislative framework in the areas of confidentiality and use of personal information. In Quebec, in September 2021, the  government  adopted  Bill 64, An Act to Modernize Legislative Provisions as Regards the Protection of Personal Information,  which  has  introduced substantial changes when it comes to the protection of personal information. Essentially, the Act promotes transparency, raises the level of confidentiality of data, and provides a framework for the collection, use, and sharing of personal information. A new federal bill that will modernize the protection of personal information is expected soon.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

New requirements will also be established for the coverage of deposits in trust, particularly nominee-brokered deposits and those of professional trustees.\n\n## Recovery and Resolution Planning\n\nAs part of the regulatory measures used to manage systemic risks, D-SIBs are required to have recovery and resolution plans. A recovery plan is essentially a roadmap that guides the recovery of a bank in the event of severe financial stress; conversely, a resolution plan guides its orderly wind-down in the event of failure when recovery is no longer an option. The Bank improves and periodically updates its recovery and resolution plans to prepare for these high-risk, but low-probability events. In addition, the Bank and other D-SIBs continue to work with the CDIC to develop a comprehensive settlement plan that would ensure orderly winding down of the Bank's operations. These plans are approved by the Board and submitted to the national regulatory agencies.\n\n## Section 871(m) - Dividend Equivalent Payments\n\nSection 871(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (or IRC) aims to ensure that non-U.S. persons pay tax on payments that can be considered dividends on U.S. shares, when these payments are made on certain derivative instruments. The derivative instruments for which the underlyings are U.S. shares (including U.S. exchange-traded funds) or 'non-qualified indices' concluded as of January 1, 2017 are subject to the withholding and reporting requirements. The effective date for certain components of this regulation has been deferred to January 1, 2023. Some of the obligations of a qualified derivatives dealer, established under section 871(m) of the IRC and the qualified intermediary agreement have also been deferred to January 1, 2023.\n\n## Common Reporting Standard - Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act\n\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), a U.S. law, and the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), an international standard, the principles of which have been incorporated into the Income Tax Act (Canada), are intended to counter tax evasion by taxpayers through the international exchange of tax information through financial institutions. The application of new penalties came into force on January 1, 2021.\n\n## Client-Centered Reforms - Amendments to Regulation 31-103\n\nPursuant to Regulation 31-103 respecting Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant obligations, a new process for declaring conflicts of interest and external activities has been in effect since June 30, 2021. Work is still ongoing with regards to the delivery, on December 31, 2021, of items relating to KYC (know-your-client) and KYP (know-your-product), misleading communications, relationship disclosure, and training.\n\n## Reform of Interest Rate Benchmarks\n\nThe reform of interest rate benchmarks is a global initiative that is being coordinated and led by central banks and governments around the world, including Canada. The objective is to improve benchmarks by ensuring that they meet robust international standards. LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rates) in particular is in the process of being discontinued, and risk-free rates, such as SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), ESTR (Euro Short-Term Rate), SONIA (Sterling Over Night Index Average), SARON (Swiss Average Rate Overnight), and TONAR (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate), are recommended as replacements for LIBOR. For additional information, see the Accounting Policy Changes section in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## R Reeppuuttaattiioonn  RRiisskk\n\nReputation risk is the risk that the Bank's operations or practices will be judged negatively by the public, whether that judgment is with or without basis, thereby adversely affecting the perception, image or trademarks of the Bank, potentially resulting in costly litigation or loss of income. Reputation risk generally arises from a deficiency in managing another risk. The Bank's reputation may, for example, be adversely affected by non-compliance with laws and regulations or by process failures. All risks must therefore be managed effectively in order to protect the Bank's reputation.\n\nThe Bank seeks to ensure that its employees are constantly aware of the potential repercussions of their actions on the Bank's reputation and image. In addition to its operational risk management initiatives mentioned above, the Bank has a variety of mechanisms to support sound reputation risk management, including codes of professional conduct applicable to all employees, policies regarding ethics and corporate governance and appropriate training programs. The Bank also has a crisis management framework including effective intervention, communication and behavioural parameters in order to minimize the impact on its activities, clients and employees.\n\nThe Bank also has a reputation risk policy, approved by the RMC, that covers all of the Bank's practices and activities. The policy sets the reputation risk management principles and rules for clients, employees and communities, all of which are stakeholders of the Bank. The policy is complemented by the special provisions of the new products and activities policy, which determines the approvals required by the various committees that assess risk whenever new  products  or  activities  are  introduced  within  the  business  units.  These  provisions  are  intended,  among  other  things,  to  provide  oversight  for  the management of reputation risk, which may be material for such products or activities. The new products and activities policy requires that any new product or activity for which reputation risk is determined to be high be submitted to the GRC for approval. The activities of the Compliance Service, Legal Affairs Department, Communications and Corporate Social Responsibility Department and Investor Relations Department complete the reputation risk management framework.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The corporate strategic plan is developed by the Office of the President, in alignment with the Bank's overall risk appetite, and approved by the Board. Once approved, the initiatives of the strategic plan are monitored regularly to ensure that they are progressing. If not, strategies could be reviewed or adjusted if deemed appropriate.\n\nIn addition, the Bank has a specific Board-approved policy for strategic investments, which are defined as purchases of business assets or acquisitions of significant interests in an entity for the purposes of acquiring control or creating a long-term relationship. As such, acquisition projects and other strategic investments are analyzed through a due diligence process to ensure that these investments are aligned with the corporate strategic plan and the Bank's risk appetite.\n\n## E Ennvviirroonnmmeennttaall  aanndd  SSoocciiaall  RRiisskk\n\nEnvironmental and social risk is the possibility that environmental and social matters would result in a financial loss for the Bank or affect its business activities. This risk encompasses many topics, in particular pollution and waste; the use of energy, water, and other resources; climate change; biodiversity; human rights; inclusion and diversity; labour standards; community health; occupational health and safety; the rights of Indigenous Peoples and consultation thereof; as well as cultural heritage. The impact of environmental and social risk could also increase exposure to strategic, reputation, and regulatory compliance risks if the Bank's response is deemed inadequate or non-compliant with commitments. The Bank is directly exposed to such risk through its own activities and indirectly exposed through the activities of its clients.\n\nAssessing and mitigating environmental and social risk are integral parts of the Bank's risk management framework. Environmental and social issues are now central to the Bank's decision-making process and are becoming increasingly strategic matters for the Bank. Taking these risks into consideration could even be viewed as a considerable asset in certain financing or investment transactions, and doing so also contributes to promoting exemplary practices to the Bank's stakeholders.\n\nThe Bank has adopted environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles that show the importance it attaches to sustainable development and to balancing the interests of societal stakeholders. These ESG principles have already been incorporated into the organization's priorities. ESG indicators have also been added to various monitoring dashboards and are gradually being integrated into the risk appetite framework. Reports on these indicators and on the Bank's ESG commitments are periodically presented to several Board committees.\n\nThe Bank has also implemented an environmental policy that applies to all activities and decisions made across the Bank. This policy clearly sets out the principles used to identify and limit environmental risk and climate risk as well as the impacts therefrom on the community and on the Bank's business segments. To proactively ensure the strategic positioning of its entire portfolio, the Bank continues to express its commitment to support the transition towards a low-carbon economy while continuing to closely monitor related developments and implications.\n\nAccordingly, the Bank supports a wide range of sustainable development initiatives and further demonstrates its commitment by deploying many initiatives that incorporate environmental and social topics into its business and operational decisions. These efforts also entail a continuous and stronger adaptation, as well as additional mitigation measures, in the event of an interruption or disruption of its activities due to major crises such as natural disasters or health crises.\n\nESG factors continue to be integrated into the Bank's processes as part of the implementation of its strategy and guiding principles approved by the Board. This integration is being conducted with due diligence, specifically in the area of the credit-granting process, starting with the corporate credit portfolio. For this clientele, the ESG risk analysis framework calls for the collection of information on carbon emissions and includes a climate risk classification (transition and physical risks) based on industry as well as scores assigned by ESG rating agencies. Several other criteria are also taken into consideration, in particular the management of waste, labour standards, corporate governance, product liability as well as human rights policies.\n\nThe Bank also works with various industry partners to identify and implement sound management practices that promote a transition to a low-carbon economy. Aware that it has a mobilizing role to play, the Bank supports the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Moreover, it has continued to demonstrate its commitment to mitigating climate risk by becoming a signatory to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) as well as by joining the United Nations' Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in addition to setting GHG emission reduction targets for its own business activities. The Bank is working on a plan, for the upcoming year, to define the actions to be undertaken to meet the above-mentioned commitments; at present time, it is impossible to determine the related amounts. The Bank is also committed to communicating, in full transparency, the information recommended by these groups as well as to periodically publishing its own performance reports.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The accounting policies discussed below are considered critical given their importance to the presentation of the Bank's financial position and operating results and require subjective and complex judgments and estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain. Any change in these judgments and estimates could have a significant impact on the Bank's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## C COOVVIIDD--1199  PPaannddeemmiicc  CCoonnssiiddeerraattiioonnss\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and, given the heightened uncertainty associated with the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, developing reliable estimates and applying judgment has become even more challenging. Some of the Bank's accounting policies, such as measurement of expected credit losses (ECLs), require particularly complex judgments and estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the most significant  estimation  processes  used  to  prepare  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  IFRS  and  the  valuation  techniques  used  to determine carrying values and fair values of assets and liabilities. The uncertainty regarding certain key inputs used in measuring ECLs is described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## C Cllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss\n\nAt initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFor the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWhen classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the relevant evidence available to the Bank at the date of determination.\n\nA financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect' business model when the Bank's primary objective is to hold these financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows from them and not to sell them. When the Bank's objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank's objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a 'hold to collect' business model or a 'hold to collect and sell' business model.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhen there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the measurement date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.\n\nIn certain cases, measurement adjustments are recognized to address factors that market participants would use at the measurement date to determine fair value but that are not included in the valuation technique due to system limitations or uncertainty surrounding the measure. These factors include, but are not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or valuation model risk and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient volume of transactions in a given market. The measurement adjustments also include the funding valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions.\n\nIFRS establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. The fair value measurement hierarchy has the following levels:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n\n## Level 2\n\nValuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and certain other liabilities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nValuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs. Financial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of investments in hedge funds, certain derivative financial instruments, equity and debt securities of private companies, certain loans, and certain deposits (structured deposit notes).\n\nEstablishing fair value is an accounting estimate and has an impact on the following items: Securities at fair value through profit or loss, certain Loans, Securities at fair value through other comprehensive income,  Obligations related to securities sold short,  Derivative financial instruments,  financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss, and financial instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This estimate also has an impact on Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income of the Financial Markets segment and of the Other heading. Lastly, this estimate has an impact on Other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

ECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions. Judgment is required in making assumptions and estimates, determining movements between the three stages, and applying forward-looking information. Any changes in assumptions and estimates, as well as the use of different, but equally reasonable, estimates and assumptions, could have an impact on the allowances for credit losses and the provisions for credit losses for the year. All business segments are affected by this accounting estimate. For additional information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## D Deetteerrmmiinniinngg  tthhee  SSttaaggee\n\nThe ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of a financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset occurs, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime expected credit losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3.\n\n## A Asssseessssmmeenntt  ooff  SSiiggnniiffiiccaanntt  IInnccrreeaassee  iinn  CCrreeddiitt  RRiisskk\n\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking information to assess deterioration in the credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment.\n\n## MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess\n\nECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. Cash shortfalls represent the difference between all contractual cash flows owed to the Bank and all cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.\n\nThe measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Forwardlooking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) are incorporated into the risk parameters. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. Probability weights are assigned to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and are subject to management review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process.\n\nECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Allowances  for  credit  losses  for  off-balance-sheet  credit  exposures  that  are  not  measured  at  fair  value  are  included  in  Other liabilities  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than the ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## D Deeffiinniittiioonn  ooff  DDeeffaauulltt\n\nThe definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following dates: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due.\n\n## W Wrriittee--OOffffss\n\nA financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances owing are not likely to be recovered.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nPremises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn impairment test compares the carrying amount of an asset with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs will be determined. Goodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or a group of CGUs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected future cash flows, discount rates, and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant impact on income. If the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nManagement exercises judgment when determining whether there is objective evidence that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. It also uses judgment in determining to which CGU or group of CGUs an asset or goodwill is to be allocated. Moreover, for impairment assessment purposes, management must make estimates and assumptions regarding the recoverable amount of non-financial assets, CGUs, or a group of CGUs. For additional information on the estimates and assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAny changes to these estimates and assumptions may have an impact on the recoverable amount of a non-financial asset and, consequently, on impairment testing results. These accounting estimates have an impact on Premises and equipment, Intangible assets and Goodwill reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The aggregate impairment loss, if any, is recognized as a non-interest expense for the corresponding segment and presented in the Other  item.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

This process includes estimating the actual amount of current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of the items reported for accounting and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, presented in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current information. The Bank periodically evaluates deferred tax assets to assess recoverability. In the Bank's opinion, based on the information at its disposal, it is probable that all deferred tax assets will be realized before they expire.\n\nThis accounting estimate affects Income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income for all business segments.

In each of the actions, the Networks and financial institutions are alleged to have been involved in a price-fixing system to maintain and increase the fees paid by merchants on transactions executed using the credit cards of the Networks. In so doing, they would notably be in breach of the Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. In 2017, a settlement was reached with the plaintiffs; in 2018 it was approved by the trial courts in each of the five jurisdictions where the action was initiated. The rulings approving the settlement were the subject of appeal proceedings in all jurisdictions. These appeal proceedings were all rejected during the year ended October 31, 2021, thereby confirming approval of the settlement reached in 2017 and ending the Bank's involvement in the class action.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Defrance\n\nOn January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the National Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a material  impact  on  the  Bank's  consolidated  results  of  operations  for  a  particular  period,  it  would  not  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Bank's consolidated financial position.\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank's best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money.\n\nThe recognition of a litigation provision requires the Bank's management to assess the probability of loss and estimate any potential monetary impact. The Bank examines each litigation provision individually by considering the development of each case, its past experience in similar transactions and the opinion of its legal counsel. Each new piece of information can alter the Bank's assessment as to the probability and estimated amount of the loss and the extent to which it adjusts the recorded provision. Moreover, the actual settlement cost of these litigations can be significantly higher or lower than the amounts recognized.\n\n## S Sttrruuccttuurreedd  EEnnttiittiieess\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank enters into arrangements and transactions with structured entities. Structured entities are entities designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity is consolidated when the Bank concludes, after evaluating the substance of the relationship and its right or exposure to variable returns, that it controls that entity. Management must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank controls an entity.

IFRS 17 introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. IFRS 17 provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 that included a two-year deferral of the effective date along with other changes aimed at addressing concerns and implementation challenges identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017. IFRS 17, as amended, is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with earlier application permitted. If full retrospective application to a group of insurance contracts is impractical, the modified retrospective approach or the fair value approach may be used.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS.\n\nManagement maintains the accounting and internal control systems needed to discharge its responsibility, which is to provide reasonable assurance that the financial accounts are accurate and complete and that the Bank's assets are adequately safeguarded. Controls that are currently in place include quality standards  on  staff  hiring  and  training;  the  implementation  of  organizational  structures  with  clear  divisions  of  responsibility  and  accountability  for performance; the Code of Professional Conduct; and the communication of operating policies and procedures.\n\nAs Chief Executive Officer and as Chief Financial Officer, we have overseen the evaluation of the design and operation of the Bank's internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings released by the Canadian Securities Administrators. Based on the evaluation work performed, we have concluded that the internal controls over financial reporting and the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as at October 31, 2021 and that they provide reasonable assurance that the financial information is reliable and that the Bank's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe Board of Directors (the Board) is responsible for reviewing and approving the financial information contained in the Annual Report. Acting through the Audit Committee, the Board also oversees the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and ensures that accounting and control systems are maintained. Composed of directors who are neither officers nor employees of the Bank, the Audit Committee is responsible, through Internal Audit, for performing an independent and objective review of the Bank's internal control effectiveness, i.e., governance processes, risk management processes and control measures. Furthermore, the Audit Committee reviews the consolidated financial statements and recommends their approval to the Board.\n\nThe control systems are further supported by the presence of the Compliance Service, which exercises independent oversight and evaluation in order to assist managers in effectively managing regulatory compliance risk and to obtain reasonable assurance that the Bank is compliant with regulatory requirements.\n\nBoth the Senior Vice-President, Internal Audit and the Senior Vice-President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Anti-Money Laundering Officer have a direct functional link to the Chair of the Audit Committee and to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee. They both also have direct access to the President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn accordance with the Bank Act (Canada), OSFI is mandated to protect the rights and interests of depositors. Accordingly, OSFI examines and enquires into the business and affairs of the Bank, as deemed necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the Bank Act (Canada) are being satisfied and that the Bank is in sound financial condition.\n\nThe independent auditor, Deloitte LLP, whose report follows, was appointed by the shareholders at the recommendation of the Board.

The calculation of ECL is based on the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) of the underlying  assets  and  represents  an  unbiased  and  probability-weighted  estimate  of  losses  expected  to  occur  in  the  future  based  on  forecasts  of macroeconomic variables for three scenarios. Lifetime ECL is recorded for financial assets that have experienced significant increases in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition or that are impaired; otherwise, 12-month ECL is recorded. Given uncertainty surrounding the key inputs used to measure credit losses, the Bank has applied expert credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results.\n\nWe have identified the allowances for credit losses as a key audit matter due to the inherent complexity of the ECL models used and the significant judgment required by management in relation to the forward-looking nature of some key assumptions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating: (i) the models and methodologies used to measure ECL; (ii) the forecasts of macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weighting; (iii) the determination of SICR; and (iv) the adjustments to the modelled ECL results representing management's expert credit judgment. Auditing the ECL models and the key judgments and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of professionals with specialized skills in credit risk and economics.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the models and the key judgments and assumptions used by management to estimate the ECL included the following, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 With the assistance of professionals with specialized skills in credit risk or economics:\n- o For a selection of ECL models, evaluated the appropriateness of the models used to estimate ECL;\n- o Evaluated the forecasts of macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weighting by comparing against independently developed forecasts and publicly available industry data, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- o Assessed management's determination of SICR and the appropriateness of the related model's programming;\n- o Assessed the adjustments to the modelled ECL results by evaluating management's expert credit judgment.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. These provisions reflect management's best possible estimate of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. As disclosed in Note 24, the Bank was reassessed by the tax authorities for additional income taxes and interest in respect of certain Canadian dividends received by the Bank for certain taxation years and may be reassessed for subsequent taxation years in regard to similar activities. The Bank has not recognized any tax liability related to these uncertain tax positions.\n\nWe have identified the assessment of the accounting of the uncertain tax positions related to certain Canadian dividends as a key audit matter given the significant judgment made by management when evaluating the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions and interpreting relevant tax and case law and administrative positions. Auditing these judgments required a high degree of auditor judgment and resulted in an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of tax specialists.\n\n## How the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures pertaining to the assessment of the accounting of the uncertain tax positions related to certain Canadian dividends included the following, among others:\n\n- \uf0b7 With the assistance of tax specialists, evaluated management's assessment of the probability of acceptance of the Bank's tax positions by assessing:\n- o The Bank's interpretations of relevant tax and case law and administrative positions;\n- o The advice and legal opinions obtained by the Bank's external tax advisors.\n- o The correspondence with the relevant tax authorities; and\n\n## OOtthheerr  IInnffoorrmmaattiioonn\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian GAAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Bank to express an opinion on the financial statements.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Carl Magnan.\n\n## / /ss//  DDeellooiittttee  LLLLPP 1 1\n\nNovember 30, 2021 Montreal, Quebec\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Its head office is located at 600 De La Gaucheti\u00e8re Street West in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The Bank is a chartered bank under Schedule 1 of the Bank Act (Canada) and is regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada (OSFI).\n\nNational Bank of Canada offers financial services to individuals, businesses, institutional clients and governments throughout Canada as well as specialized services at the international level. It operates four business segments, namely, the Personal and Commercial segment, the Wealth Management segment, the Financial Markets segment, and the U.S. Specialty Finance and International (USSF&I) segment. Its full line of services includes banking and investing solutions for individuals and businesses, corporate banking and investment banking services, securities brokerage, insurance, and wealth management.\n\nOn November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the publication of the Bank's audited annual consolidated financial  statements (the consolidated financial statements) for the year ended October 31, 2021.\n\n## B Baassiiss  ooff  PPrreesseennttaattiioonn\n\nThe  Bank's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  as  issued  by  the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements also comply with section 308(4) of the Bank Act (Canada), which states that, except as otherwise specified by the OSFI, the consolidated financial statements are to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. IFRS represent Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). None of the OSFI accounting requirements are exceptions to IFRS.\n\nThe accounting policies covered in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies section have been applied consistently to all periods presented except for the changes described hereafter in the Accounting Policy Changes section, which have been applied since November 1, 2020 following the Bank's early adoption of amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and to IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) as well as to the related standard IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4), and to IFRS 16 - Leases (IFRS 16) resulting from interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nOn November 1, 2020, the Bank amended the classification of certain Consolidated Statement of Income amounts to better reflect the nature of the revenues reported in the Wealth Management segment. The reclassifications were made retrospectively among the items presented in Non-Interest Income. These reclassifications had no impact on the total amount of this income or on Net income.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## A Accccoouunnttiinngg  PPoolliiccyy  CChhaannggeess\n\nThe Bank adopted the following new and amended standards on November 1, 2020.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  RRaattee  BBeenncchhmmaarrkk  RReeffoorrmm\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB finalized its response to the ongoing reform of interbank offered rates (IBOR) and other interest rate benchmarks by issuing amendments to its new and former financial instrument standards, IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IFRS 9) and IAS 39 - Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (IAS 39) as well as to related standard IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), to IFRS 4 - Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4), and to IFRS 16  -  Leases (IFRS 16). The amendments complement those issued in 2019 and focus on how financial statements will be affected once existing benchmark rates are replaced with alternative benchmark rates. The amendments in this final phase relate to changes to contractual cash flows, hedge accounting, and disclosures. On November 1, 2020, the Bank early adopted the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16.\n\nThe amendments introduce a practical expedient to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of non-derivative financial instruments by prospectively revising the effective interest rate to reflect the change in the interest rate benchmark if the change is a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis. If additional changes are made and are not directly related to the reform, the IFRS 9 requirements are to be applied.\n\nA temporary relief is also provided to hedge accounting requirements such that existing relationships that do not qualify under IAS 39 will be permitted if the change is affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Bank will update the hedge documentation without discontinuing the hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges, if the hedged item is modified due to the interest rate benchmark reform, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserve for designated IBOR cash flow hedges will be deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate. For the fair value hedges of a non-contractually specified benchmark component of interest rate risk, if that risk rate is not separately identifiable upon transition to the alternative benchmark rate at the date of designation, it will be deemed to have met the separately identifiable requirement at that date if the Bank reasonably expects the term-specific interest rate component to be separately identifiable within a period of 24 months from the date the alternative benchmark rate is first designated, regardless of the term for which the risk is designated in that hedge. The 24-month period will apply on a rate-by-rate basis.\n\nThe reform of interest rate benchmarks is a global initiative that is being coordinated and led by central banks and governments around the world, including Canada. The objective is to improve benchmarks by ensuring that they meet robust international standards. The initiative introduces other benchmarks as recommended rates (risk-free rates such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) and Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR)) to replace the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR), which are the benchmark rates used by the world's major banks for short-term lending in the interbank market. These rates, in particular LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rates), are widely used around the world as benchmarks for derivative financial instruments, bonds, and other variable-rate instruments. To ensure an orderly transition to the risk-free rates for derivatives, the industry has proposed a solution through ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) via a protocol (2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol) as well as a supplement to the 2006 definitions, which came into force on January 25, 2021. The Bank adopted the 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol on October 16, 2020 and is monitoring the adherence  by  its  derivatives  counterparties  to  plan  the  transition  of  its  legacy  derivatives  contracts  accordingly.  For  certain  other  types  of  contracts, contractual amendments are expected by the end of 2021, at which time certain LIBOR rates are expected to be withdrawn. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom announced the cessation or loss of representativeness of all LIBOR rates in two phases: pound sterling (GBP), euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), Swiss franc (CHF) rates as of December 31, 2021 and U.S. dollar (USD) rates as of June 30, 2023 (except for 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR, which cease as of December 31, 2021). The risk-free rates Sterling OverNight Index Average (SONIA), ESTR, Tokyo OverNight Average Rate (TONAR), and Swiss Average Rate OverNight (SARON) are being recommended to replace LIBOR as of December 31, 2021. This official announcement had the effect of fixing spread adjustments between the LIBOR rates and the corresponding risk-free rates set out in the rate-replacement methodology proposed by ISDA. At the same time, the FCA announced that in the months ahead it is launching consultations to assess the appropriateness of publishing certain synthetic LIBOR rates for a given period; they would be calculated using the rate-replacement methodology and based on the corresponding risk-free rates with spread adjustments. This measure would be adopted from a consumer protection and market integrity viewpoint to mitigate the difficulty of amending certain types of contracts when replacing the applicable rate. On May 20, 2021 and June 24, 2021, the FCA issued two consultations on this topic. On September 29, 2021, the FCA confirmed that 1-, 3-, and 6-month GBP and JPY LIBOR rates would continue being published for a period of one year following the discontinuance thereof on December 31, 2021 using a 'synthetic' methodology, i.e., to be calculated using the corresponding risk-free rates, namely, ICE Term  SONIA  and  the  Tokyo  Term  Risk-Free  Rate  (TORF),  with  the  respective  ISDA  fixed  spread  adjustment.  This  announcement  was  accompanied  by  a consultation on the acceptable parameters for using these synthetic rates. On November 16, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the use of synthetic rates GBP and JPY  LIBOR  would  be  permitted  until  the  end  of  2022  for  all  pre-existing  contracts  except  for  cleared  derivative  financial  instruments. In  addition,  on May 21, 2021, the group working on alternative reference rates in the United States, named the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), announced that CME Group had been selected as the administrator for a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) term rates and that the ARRC will be able to officially recommend these SOFR term rates once certain conditions are met; these rates are to be used in certain sectors of the market, in particular the commercial loans market. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC announced that it was formally recommending the SOFR term rate administered by CME Group.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Several committees were created to ensure the success of the project and to prepare for the interest rate benchmark reform. The project team is made up of qualified resources from different fields of expertise to ensure an in-depth analysis of all aspects of the changes as well as the financial, legal, operational and technological impacts. Many of these experts, who have in-depth knowledge of accounting standards and reform-related activities, are involved in the Canadian Bankers Association's working group where representatives of the major Canadian banks discuss the issues and interpretations of the reform. The Bank also participates in meetings with OSFI to discuss these same issues and interpretations. Furthermore, workshops are held to analyze the impact of the reform's implementation, ensuring that information is disseminated to stakeholders affected by this reform; information-sharing meetings are held with all stakeholders affected by the reform, and participants from various industry committees share the latest developments.\n\nThe project team regularly reports on the project's progress to the project steering committee and the Financial Markets Risk Committee, which are committees made up of members of management and experts from all departments involved. As at October 31, 2021, the project was progressing according to schedule. Lastly, a training plan for staff, management, and board members has been created.\n\nThe Bank is exposed to several risks, including interest rate risk and operational risk, which arise from non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities, and derivative financial instruments. The project team ensures that risks are mitigated while ensuring a positive experience for its clients. The Bank is taking all necessary steps to identify, measure, and control all risks to ensure a smooth transition to the interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe following table discloses the non-derivative financial assets, non-derivative financial liabilities, and derivative financial instruments subject to the interest rate benchmark reform as at October 31, 2021 that have yet to transition to alternative benchmark rates and that will mature after December 31, 2021.\n\n|                                          | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,, 22002211   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,, 22002211   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,, 22002211   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,, 22002211   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,, 22002211   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | U USSDD  LLIIBBOORR (1)                        | E EUURR  LLIIBBOORR                            | G GBBPP  LLIIBBOORR                            | J JPPYY  LLIIBBOORR                            | C CHHFF  LLIIBBOORR                            |\n| Non-derivative financial assets (2)      | 8 8,,008844                                    | 4 488                                          | 1 13311                                        | - -                                            | - -                                            |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities (3) | 1 111                                          | - -                                            | - -                                            | - -                                            | - -                                            |\n| Derivative financial instruments (4)     | 1 15566,,992299                                | - -                                            | 9 9,,001155                                    | 4 47788                                        | 3 366                                          |\n\n## C Coonncceeppttuuaall  FFrraammeewwoorrkk  ffoorr  FFiinnaanncciiaall  RReeppoorrttiinngg\n\nThe Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting stipulates that financial information must be relevant and achieve fair presentation to be useful. The framework provides revised definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities and confirms that different measurement bases are useful and permitted.

In these types of arrangements, access to software is usually provided through the Internet. The main conclusion is that, where the costs do not give rise to an intangible asset that is separate from the software, they are recognized as an expense  when  the  customer  receives  the  configuration  or  customization  services.  IFRIC  determined  that  sufficient  guidance  exists  within  the  relevant accounting standards and that the conclusions, as set out in the final agenda decision, form part of the interpretation of IFRS. As such, any changes from these interpretations would be accounted for as a retrospectively applied accounting policy change in accordance with IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The Bank is currently assessing the impact of these interpretations on its consolidated financial statements and expects to finalize its assessment during the year ended October 31, 2022.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Furthermore, certain accounting policies require complex judgments and estimates because they apply to matters that are inherently uncertain, in particular accounting policies applicable to the following: the fair value determination of financial instruments, the impairment of financial assets, the impairment of non-financial assets, pension plans and other postemployment benefits, income taxes, provisions, the consolidation of structured entities, and the classification of debt instruments. Descriptions of these judgments and estimates are provided in each of the notes related thereto in the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could therefore differ from these estimates, in which case the impacts are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of future fiscal periods. The accounting policies described in this note provide greater detail about the use of estimates and assumptions and reliance on judgment.\n\n## C COOVVIIDD--1199  PPaannddeemmiicc  CCoonnssiiddeerraattiioonnss\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and, given the heightened uncertainty associated with the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, developing reliable estimates and applying judgment has become even more challenging. Some of the Bank's accounting policies, such as measurement of expected credit losses, require particularly complex judgments and estimates. The uncertainty regarding certain key inputs used in measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) is described in Note 7 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## B Baassiiss  ooff  CCoonnssoolliiddaattiioonn\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThese consolidated financial statements include all the assets, liabilities, operating results and cash flows of the Bank and its subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances. Subsidiaries are entities, including structured entities, controlled by the Bank. A structured entity is an entity created to accomplish a narrow and well-defined objective and is designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate solely to administrative tasks and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nManagement must exercise judgment in determining whether the Bank must consolidate an entity. The Bank controls an entity only if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- \uf0b7 it has decision-making authority regarding the entity's relevant activities;\n- \uf0b7 it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \uf0b7 it has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of the returns.\n\nWhen determining decision-making authority, the Bank considers many factors, including the existence and effect of actual and potential voting rights held by the Bank that can be exercised as well as the holding of instruments that are convertible into voting shares. In addition, the Bank must determine whether, as an investor with decision-making rights, it acts as a principal or agent.\n\nBased on these principles, an assessment of control is performed at the inception of a relationship between any entity and the Bank. When performing this assessment, the Bank considers all facts and circumstances, and it must reassess whether it still controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that one or more of the three conditions of control have changed.\n\nThe Bank consolidates the entities it controls from the date on which control is obtained and ceases to consolidate them from the date control ceases. The Bank uses the acquisition method to account for the acquisition of a subsidiary from a third party on the date control is obtained.\n\n## Non-Controlling Interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity interests held by third parties in the Bank's subsidiaries and are presented in total Equity, separately from Equity attributable to the Bank's shareholders and holders of other equity instruments. The non-controlling interests' proportionate shares of the net income and other comprehensive income of the Bank's subsidiaries are presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, respectively.\n\nWith respect to units issued to third parties by mutual funds and certain other funds that are consolidated, they are presented at fair value in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lastly, changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are recognized as equity transactions. The difference between the adjustment in the carrying value of the non-controlling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in Equity attributable to the Bank's shareholders and holders of other equity instruments.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank has joint control when there's a contractually agreed sharing of control of an entity, and joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInvestments in associates, i.e., entities over which the Bank exercises significant influence, and investments in joint ventures, i.e., entities over which the Bank has rights to the net assets and exercises joint control, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and, following acquisition, the Bank's proportionate shares in the net income and in the other comprehensive income are recognized, respectively,  in  Non-interest income  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  and  in  Other comprehensive income  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of Comprehensive Income. The carrying value of the investment is adjusted by an equivalent amount on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and reduced by distributions received.\n\n## T Trraannssllaattiioonn  ooff  FFoorreeiiggnn  CCuurrrreenncciieess\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars, which is the Bank's functional and presentation currency. Each foreign operation within the Bank's scope of consolidation determines its own functional currency, and the items reported in the financial statements of each foreign operation are measured using that currency.\n\nMonetary items and non-monetary items measured at fair value and denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Non-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated into the functional currency at historical rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Translation gains and losses are recognized  in  Non-interest income  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income,  except  for  equity  instruments  designated  at  fair  value  through  other comprehensive income, for which unrealized gains and losses are recorded in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of all foreign operations are translated into the Bank's functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date, whereas the revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated into the Bank's functional currency at the average exchange rates for the period. Any goodwill resulting from the acquisition of a foreign operation that does not have the same functional currency as the parent company, and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition, are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Unrealized translation gains and losses relating to foreign operations, along with the impact of hedges and income taxes on the related results, are presented in Other comprehensive income. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, any accumulated translation gains and losses, along with the related hedges, recorded in the Accumulated other comprehensive income item of this foreign operation, are reclassified to Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## C Cllaassssiiffiiccaattiioonn  aanndd  MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss\n\nAt initial recognition, all financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At initial recognition, financial assets must be classified as subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, at amortized cost, or at fair value through profit or loss. The Bank determines the classification based on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets and on the business model it uses to manage these financial assets. At initial recognition, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortized cost or as at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nFor the purpose of classifying a financial asset, the Bank must determine whether the contractual cash flows associated with the financial asset are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The principal is generally the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition. The interest consists of consideration for the time value of money, for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period, and for other basic lending risks and costs as well as of a profit margin. If the Bank determines that the contractual cash flows associated with a financial asset are not solely payments of principal and interest, the financial assets must be classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nWhen classifying financial assets, the Bank determines the business model used for each portfolio of financial assets that are managed together to achieve a same business objective. The business model reflects how the Bank manages its financial assets and the extent to which the financial asset cash flows are generated by the collection of the contractual cash flows, the sale of the financial assets, or both. The Bank determines the business model using scenarios that it reasonably expects to occur. Consequently, the business model determination is a matter of fact and requires the use of judgment and consideration of all the relevant evidence available at the date of determination.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

When the Bank's objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling the financial assets, the financial asset portfolio falls within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model. In this type of business model, collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets are both integral components to achieving the Bank's objective for this financial asset portfolio. Financial assets are mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss if they do not fall within either a 'hold to collect' business model or a 'hold to collect and sell' business model.\n\n## Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss\n\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at initial recognition if certain conditions are met. The Bank may apply this option if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities or recognizing gains and losses on them on different bases and if the fair values are reliable. Financial assets thus designated are recognized at fair value, and any change in fair value is recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Interest income arising from these financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nA financial liability may be irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss when it is initially recognized.

Fair value changes not attributable to the Bank's own credit risk are recognized in  Non-interest income  in  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.  The  amounts  recognized  in  Other comprehensive income  will  not  be  subsequently reclassified to Net income. Interest expense arising from these financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in the Net interest income item of the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Bank may use this option in the following cases:\n\n- \uf0b7 if, consistent with a documented risk management strategy, using this option allows the Bank to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets or liabilities on different bases, and if the fair values are reliable;\n- \uf0b7 if a group of financial assets and financial liabilities to which an instrument belongs is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Bank's documented risk management or investment strategy, and information is provided on that basis to senior management. Consequently, the Bank may use this option if it has implemented a documented risk management strategy to manage a group of financial instruments together on the fair value basis, if it can demonstrate that significant financial risks are eliminated or significantly reduced, and if the fair values are reliable;\n- \uf0b7 for hybrid financial instruments with one or more embedded derivatives that would significantly modify the cash flows of the financial instruments and that would otherwise be bifurcated and accounted for separately.\n\n## Financial Instruments Designated at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  an  investment  in  an  equity  instrument  that  is  neither  held  for  trading  nor  a  contingent  consideration  recognized  in  a  business combination may be irrevocably designated as being at fair value through other comprehensive income. In accordance with this designation, any change in fair value is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification to net income. Dividend income is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nSecurities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income include: (i) debt securities for which the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and that fall within a 'hold to collect and sell' business model and (ii) equity securities designated at fair value through other comprehensive income with no subsequent reclassification of gains and losses to net income.\n\nThe Bank recognizes securities transactions at fair value through other comprehensive income on the trade date, and the transaction costs are capitalized. Interest income and dividend income are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Debt Securities Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized, net of expected credit losses and income taxes, and provided that they are not hedged by derivative financial instruments in a fair value hedging relationship, in Other comprehensive income. When the securities are sold, realized gains or losses, determined on an average cost basis, are reclassified to Non-interest income - Gains (losses) on non-trading securities, net in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

These transactions are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows that  are  solely  payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount  outstanding.  Securities  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  remain  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet, whereas securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized. Reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are treated as collateralized lending and borrowing transactions.\n\nThe Bank also borrows and lends securities. Securities loaned remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet while securities borrowed are not recognized. As part of these transactions, the Bank pledges or receives collateral in the form of cash or securities. Collateral pledged in the form of securities remains on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Collateral received in the form of securities is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

These loans are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, i.e., cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. All loans originated by the Bank are recognized when cash is advanced to a borrower. Purchased loans are recognized when the cash consideration is paid by the Bank.\n\nAll loans are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable costs and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, net of an allowance for expected credit losses. For purchased performing loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. For purchased credit-impaired loans, the acquisition date fair value adjustment on each loan consists of management's estimate of the shortfall of principal and interest cash flows that the Bank expects to collect and of the time value of money. The time value of money component of the fair value adjustment is amortized to interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the effective interest rate method. Loans are presented net of allowances for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Loans Measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss\n\nLoans classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss, loans designated at fair value through profit or loss, and loans for which the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The interest income on loans at fair value through profit or loss is recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nChanges in the fair value of loans classified as at fair value through profit or loss and loans designated at fair value through profit or loss are recognized in Non-interest income - Trading revenues (losses) in the Consolidated Statement of Income. With respect to loans whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments  of  principal  and  interest  on  the  principal  amount  outstanding,  changes  in  fair  value  are  recognized  in  Non-interest income - Other  in  the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Reclassification of Financial Assets\n\nA financial asset, other than a derivative financial instrument or a financial asset that, at initial recognition, was designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, is reclassified only in rare situations, i.e., when there is a change in the business model used to manage the financial asset. The reclassification is applied prospectively from the reclassification date.\n\n## E Essttaabblliisshhiinngg  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell a financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price).\n\nUnadjusted quoted prices in active markets, based on bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities, provide the best evidence of fair value. A financial instrument is considered quoted in an active market when prices in exchange, dealer, broker or principal-to-principal markets are accessible at the measurement date. An active market is one where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide quoted prices on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhen there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank uses another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that market participants would consider when pricing a transaction. Judgment is required when applying a large number of acceptable valuation techniques and estimates to determine fair value. The estimated fair value reflects market conditions on the valuation date and, consequently, may not be indicative of future fair value.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price, i.e., the fair value of the consideration received or paid. If there is a difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price, and the fair value is determined using a valuation technique based on observable market inputs or, in the case of a derivative, if the risks are fully offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, this difference is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In other cases, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of the deferred gain or loss is recognized over the term of the financial instrument. The unamortized balance is immediately recognized in net income when (i) observable market inputs can be obtained and support the fair value of the transaction, (ii) the risks associated with the initial contract are substantially offset by other contracts entered into with third parties, (iii) the gain or loss is realized through a cash receipt or payment, or (iv) the transaction matures or is cancelled before maturity.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

These factors include, but are not limited to, the unobservable nature of inputs used in the valuation model, assumptions about risk such as market risk, credit risk, or risk related to the valuation model, and future administration costs. The Bank may also consider market liquidity risk when determining the fair value of financial instruments when it believes these instruments could be disposed of for a consideration below the fair value otherwise determined due to a lack of market liquidity or an insufficient volume of transactions in a given market. The measurement adjustments also include the funding valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the market implied cost or benefits of funding collateral for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions.\n\nAs permitted when certain criteria are met, the Bank has elected to determine fair value based on net exposure to credit risk or market risk for certain portfolios of financial instruments, mainly derivative financial instruments.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Bank applies a three-stage impairment approach to measure the expected credit losses (ECL) on all debt instruments measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income and on loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not measured at fair value. The ECL model is forward looking. Measurement of ECLs at each reporting period reflects reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions.\n\n## Determining the Stage\n\nThe ECL three-stage impairment approach is based on the change in the credit quality of financial assets since initial recognition. If, at the reporting date, the credit risk of non-impaired financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition, these financial instruments are classified in Stage 1, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses is recorded. When there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, these non-impaired financial instruments are migrated to Stage 2, and an allowance for credit losses that is measured, at each reporting date, in an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses is recorded. In subsequent reporting periods, if the credit risk of the financial instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the ECL model requires reverting to Stage 1, i.e., recognition of 12-month expected credit losses. When one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset have occurred, the financial asset is considered credit-impaired and is migrated to Stage 3, and an allowance for credit losses equal to lifetime expected losses continues to be recorded or the financial asset is written off. Interest income is calculated on the gross carrying amount for financial assets in Stages 1 and 2 and on the net carrying amount for financial assets in Stage 3.\n\n## Assessment of Significant Increase in Credit Risk\n\nIn determining whether credit risk has increased significantly, the Bank uses an internal credit risk grading system, external risk ratings, and forward-looking information to assess deterioration in credit quality of a financial instrument. To assess whether or not the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly, the Bank compares the probability of default (PD) occurring over its expected life as at the reporting date with the PD occurring over its expected life on the date of initial recognition and considers reasonable and supportable information indicative of a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. The Bank includes relative and absolute thresholds in the definition of significant increase in credit risk and a backstop of 30 days past due. All financial instruments that are 30 days past due are migrated to Stage 2 even if other metrics do not indicate that a significant increase in credit risk has occurred. The assessment of a significant increase in credit risk requires significant judgment.\n\n## Measurement of Expected Credit Losses\n\nECLs are measured as the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument, and reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions, and forecasts of future events and economic conditions is considered. The estimation and application of forward-looking information requires significant judgment. Cash shortfalls represent the difference between all contractual cash flows owed to the Bank and all cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.\n\nThe measurement of ECLs is primarily based on the product of the financial instrument's PD, loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD). Forwardlooking macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, housing price indices, interest rates, and the gross domestic product (GDP) are incorporated into the risk parameters. The estimate of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. The Bank incorporates three forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios in its ECL calculation process: a base scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. Probability weights are attributed to each scenario. The scenarios and probability weights are reassessed quarterly and are subject to management review. The Bank applies experienced credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results when it becomes evident that known or expected risk factors and information were not considered in the credit risk rating and modelling process.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "ECLs for all financial instruments are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the case of debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, ECLs are recognized in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, and a corresponding amount is recognized in Other comprehensive income with no reduction in the carrying amount of the asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As for debt instruments measured at amortized cost, they are presented net of the related allowance for credit losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Allowances  for  credit  losses  for  off-balance-sheet  credit  exposures  that  are  not  measured  at  fair  value  are  included  in  Other liabilities  on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired Financial Assets\n\nOn initial recognition of a financial asset, the Bank determines whether the asset is credit-impaired. For financial assets that are credit-impaired upon purchase or origination, the lifetime expected credit losses are reflected in the initial fair value. In subsequent reporting periods, the Bank recognizes only the cumulative changes in these lifetime ECLs since initial recognition as an allowance for credit losses. The Bank recognizes changes in ECLs in Provisions for credit losses in the Consolidated Statement of Income, even if the lifetime ECLs are less than the ECLs that were included in the estimated cash flows on initial recognition.\n\n## Definition of Default\n\nThe definition of default used by the Bank to measure ECLs and transfer financial instruments between stages is consistent with the definition of default used for internal credit risk management purposes. The Bank considers a financial asset, other than a credit card receivable, to be credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred or when contractual payments are 90 days past due. Credit card receivables are considered credit-impaired and are fully written off at the earlier of the following dates: when a notice of bankruptcy is received, a settlement proposal is made, or contractual payments are 180 days past due.\n\n## Write-Offs\n\nA financial asset and its related allowance for credit losses are normally written off in whole or in part when the Bank considers the probability of recovery to be non-existent and when all guarantees and other remedies available to the Bank have been exhausted or if the borrower is bankrupt or winding up and balances owing are not likely to be recovered.\n\n## DDeerreeccooggnniittiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  aanndd  SSeeccuurriittiizzaattiioonn\n\nA financial asset is considered for derecognition when the Bank has transferred contractual rights to receive the cash flows or assumed an obligation to transfer these cash flows to a third party. The Bank derecognizes a financial asset when it considers that substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have been transferred or when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset expire. When the Bank considers that it has retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred asset, it continues to recognize the financial asset and, if applicable, recognizes a financial  liability  on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet.  If,  due  to  a  derivative  financial  instrument,  the  transfer  of  a  financial  asset  does  not  result  in derecognition, the derivative financial instrument is not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhen the Bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset, it derecognizes the financial asset it no longer controls. Any rights and obligations retained following the asset transfer are recognized separately as an asset or liability. If the Bank retains control of the financial asset, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset, i.e., to the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nIn order to diversify its funding sources, the Bank participates in two Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) securitization programs: the Mortgage-Backed Securities Program under the National Housing Act (Canada) (NHA) and Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. Under the first program, the Bank issues NHA securities backed by insured residential mortgages and, under the second, the Bank sells NHA securities to Canada Housing Trust (CHT). As part of these transactions, the Bank retains substantially all the risks and rewards related to ownership of the mortgage loans sold. Therefore, the insured mortgage loans securitized under the CMB program continue to be recognized in the Loans item of the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet and the liabilities for the considerations received from the transfer are recognized in Liabilities related to transferred receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Moreover, insured mortgage loans securitized and retained by the Bank continue to be recognized in Loans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## D Deerreeccooggnniittiioonn  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  LLiiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation is discharged, cancelled, or expires.

Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are included in assets, and derivative financial instruments with a negative fair value are included in liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where there are offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities, the net fair value of certain derivative financial instruments is reported either as an asset or as a liability.\n\n## Embedded Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host, the effect being that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. An embedded derivative causes some or all of the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract to be modified according to a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to one of the parties to the contract.\n\nA derivative embedded in a financial liability is separated from the host contract and treated as a separate derivative if, and only if, the following three conditions are met: the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, the embedded derivative is a separate instrument that meets the definition of a derivative financial instrument, and the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEmbedded derivatives that are separately accounted for are measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In general, all embedded derivatives are presented on a combined basis with the host contract. However, certain embedded derivatives that are separated from the host contract are presented in Derivative financial instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Held-for-Trading Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value, and the realized and unrealized gains and losses (including interest income and expense) are recorded in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\n## Policy\n\nThe purpose of a hedging transaction is to modify the Bank's exposure to one or more risks by creating an offset between changes in the fair value of, or the cash flows attributable to, the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Hedge accounting ensures that offsetting gains, losses, revenues and expenses are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period or periods.\n\n## Documenting and Assessing Effectiveness\n\nThe Bank designates and formally documents each hedging relationship, at its inception, by detailing the risk management objective and the hedging strategy. The documentation identifies the specific asset, liability, or cash flows being hedged, the related hedging instrument, the nature of the specific risk exposure or exposures being hedged, the intended term of the hedging relationship, and the method for assessing the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the hedging relationship. At the inception of the hedging relationship, and for every financial reporting period for which the hedge has been designated, the Bank ensures that the hedging relationship is highly effective and consistent with its originally documented risk management objective and strategy. When a hedging relationship meets the hedge accounting requirements, it is designated as either a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge or a foreign exchange hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nA  hedging  relationship  is  directly  affected  by  interest  rate  benchmark  reform  such  as  Interbank  Offered  Rates  (IBORs)  only  if  the  reform  gives  rise  to uncertainties about (a) the interest rate benchmark (contractually or non-contractually specified) designated as a hedged risk; and/or (b) the timing or the amount of the interest-rate-benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the hedging instrument.\n\nFor such hedging relationships, the following temporary exceptions apply during the period of uncertainty:\n\n- \u00b7 when determining whether a forecast transaction is highly probable or expected to occur, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform;\n- \u00b7 when assessing whether a hedge is expected to be highly effective, it is assumed that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform;\n- \u00b7 a hedge is not required to be discontinued if the actual results of the hedge are outside an effectiveness range of 80% to 125% as a result of interest rate benchmark reform;\n- \u00b7 for a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, the requirement that the designated portion is separately identifiable need only be met at the inception of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair Value Hedges\n\nFor fair value hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of a hedged item. The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted based on the effective portion of the gains or losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as well as the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The resulting ineffective portion is recognized in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe Bank prospectively discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank revokes the designation. When the designation is revoked, the hedged item is no longer adjusted to reflect changes in fair value, and the amounts previously recorded as cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are amortized using the effective interest rate method and recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income over the remaining useful life of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or terminated before maturity, the cumulative adjustments with respect to the effective portion of gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk are immediately recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedges\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the Bank mainly uses interest rate swaps and total return swaps to hedge variable cash flows attributable to the hedged risk related to a financial asset or liability (or to a group of financial assets or liabilities). The effective portion of changes in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe amounts previously recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income of the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income. If the hedging instrument is sold or expires or if the hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or if the Bank cancels that designation, then the amounts previously recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the hedged item affect the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Hedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations\n\nDerivative and non-derivative financial instruments are used to hedge foreign exchange risk related to investments made in foreign operations whose functional currency is not the Canadian dollar. The effective portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instrument is recognized in Other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Upon the total or partial sale of a net investment in a foreign  operation,  amounts  reported  in  Accumulated other comprehensive income are  reclassified,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  Non-interest income in  the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## OOffffsseettttiinngg  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss  aanndd  LLiiaabbiilliittiieess\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

For additional information about the accounting treatment of right-of-use assets, see the Leases section presented below.\n\nBuildings, computer equipment, and equipment and furniture are systematically depreciated over their estimated useful lives. The depreciation period for leasehold improvements is the lesser of the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements or the non-cancellable period of the lease plus the first renewal option.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. When the Bank is a lessee, it recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date except for short-term leases (defined as leases with terms of 12 months or less) other than real estate leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. For such leases, the Bank recognizes the lease payments as a non-interest expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As a practical expedient, the Bank elected for real estate leases not to separate non-lease components from lease components and instead account for them as a single lease component. When the Bank is the lessor, the leased assets remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reported in Premises and equipment, and the rental income is recognized net of related expenses in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of lease liabilities. The cost of a right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease, and an estimate of costs to dismantle the asset or restore the site, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the lease term and the estimated useful life of the asset. Right-of-use assets are presented in Premises and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The depreciation expense and impairment losses, if any, are recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments net of lease incentives not yet received. The present value of lease payments is determined using the Bank's incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. In determining the lease term, the Bank considers all the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not to exercise a termination option. The lease term determined by the Bank comprises the non-cancellable period of lease contracts, the periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and the periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Bank is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. The Bank reassesses the lease term if a significant event or change in circumstances occurs and that is within its control. The Bank applies judgment to determine the lease term when the lease includes extension and termination options. Lease liabilities are presented  in  Other liabilities on  the  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet,  and  the  interest  expense  is  presented  in  the  Interest expense - Other  item  of  the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the acquisition-date fair value, and the transaction costs related to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. When the Bank acquires control of a business, all of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree, including intangible assets, are recorded at fair value. The interests previously held in the acquiree are also measured at fair value. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration and all previously held interests over  the  fair  value  of  the identifiable net assets of the acquiree. If the fair value of the identifiable net assets exceeds the purchase consideration and all previously held interests, the difference is immediately recognized in income as a gain on a bargain purchase.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Bank's ownership interest and can be initially measured at either fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The measurement basis is selected on a case-by-case basis. Following an acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the value assigned to those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of the acquisition.\n\n## I Innttaannggiibbllee  AAsssseettss\n\n## Intangible Assets With Finite Useful Lives\n\nSoftware and certain other intangible assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. These intangible assets are systematically amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which vary between four and ten years. The amortization expense is recorded in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\n## Intangible Assets With Indefinite Useful Lives\n\nThe Bank's intangible assets with indefinite useful lives come from the acquisition of subsidiaries or groups of assets and consist of management contracts and a trademark. They are recognized at the acquisition-date fair value. The management contracts are for the management of open-ended funds. At the end of each  reporting  period,  the  Bank  reviews  the  useful  lives  to  determine  whether  facts  and  circumstances  continue  to  support  an  indefinite  useful  life assessment. Intangible assets are deemed to have an indefinite useful life following an examination of all relevant factors, in particular: (a) the contracts do not have contractual maturities; (b) the stability of the business segment to which the intangible assets belong; (c) the Bank's capacity to control the future economic benefits of the intangible assets; and (d) the continued economic benefits generated by the intangible assets.\n\n## I Immppaaiirrmmeenntt  ooff  NNoonn--FFiinnaanncciiaall  AAsssseettss\n\nPremises and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. At the end of each reporting period, the Bank determines whether there is an indication that premises and equipment or intangible assets with finite useful lives may be impaired. Goodwill and intangible assets that are not available for use or that have indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset might be impaired.\n\nAn asset is tested for impairment by comparing its carrying amount with its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount must be estimated for the individual asset. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs will be determined. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The Bank uses judgment to identify CGUs.\n\nAn asset's recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or CGU. Value in use is the present value of expected future cash flows from the asset or CGU. The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined using valuation models that consider various factors such as projected future cash flows, discount rates, and growth rates. The use of different estimates and assumptions in applying the impairment tests could have a significant impact on income.\n\nCorporate assets, such as the head office building and computer equipment, do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows generated by other assets or groups of assets. Therefore, the recoverable amount of an individual corporate asset cannot be determined unless management has decided to dispose of the asset. However, if there is an indication that a corporate asset may be impaired, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU or group of CGUs to which the corporate asset belongs, and that recoverable amount is compared with the carrying amount of this CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (cont.)\n\nGoodwill is always tested for impairment at the level of a CGU or group of CGUs. For impairment testing purposes, from the acquisition date, goodwill resulting from a business combination must be allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated must represent the lowest level for which the goodwill is monitored internally at the Bank and must not be larger than an operating segment. The allocation of goodwill to a CGU or group of CGUs involves management's judgment. If an impairment loss is to be recognized, the Bank does so by first reducing the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU or group of CGUs and then reducing the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU or group of CGUs in proportion to the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU or group of CGUs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognized in Non-interest expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Income. An impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill must be reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased, given that the impairment loss was reversed, but shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortization, had no impairment loss been recognized for this asset in previous years.\n\n## P Prroovviissiioonnss\n\nProvisions are liabilities of uncertain timing and amount. A provision is recognized when the Bank has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions are based on the Bank's best estimates of the economic resources required to settle the present obligation, given all relevant risks and uncertainties, and, when it is significant, the effect of the time value of money. Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period. Provisions are presented in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## I Inntteerreesstt  IInnccoommee  aanndd  EExxppeennssee\n\nInterest income and expense, except for the interest income on securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, are recognized in Net interest income and calculated using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash inflows and outflows through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Bank estimates expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between the parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets and financial assets that were not impaired upon their purchase or origination but became impaired thereafter. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, the Bank applies the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortized cost  of  the  financial  asset  from  initial  recognition.  The  credit-adjusted  effective  interest  rate  reflects  expected  credit  losses.  As  for  loans  that  have subsequently become credit-impaired, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount (net of allowances for credit losses) rather than to the carrying amount.\n\nLoan origination fees, including commitment, restructuring, and renegotiation fees, are considered an integral part of the yield earned on the loan. They are deferred and amortized using the effective interest method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Direct costs for originating a loan are netted against the loan origination fees. If it is likely that a commitment will result in a loan, commitment fees receive the same accounting treatment, i.e., they are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Otherwise, they are recorded in Non-interest income over the term of the commitment.\n\nLoan syndication fees are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan. Certain mortgage loan prepayment fees are recognized in Interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income when earned.\n\n## D Diivviiddeenndd  IInnccoommee\n\nDividends from an equity instrument are recognized in Net interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income when the Bank's right to receive payment is established.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The revenue may therefore be recognized at a point in time, upon completion of the service, or over time as services are provided.\n\nThe Bank must also determine whether its performance obligation is to provide the service itself or to arrange for another party to provide the service (in other words, whether the Bank is acting as a principal or agent). A principal may itself satisfy its performance obligation to provide the specified good or service or it may engage another party to satisfy some or all of the performance obligation on its behalf. A principal also has the primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service to the customer and has discretion in establishing the price for the service. If the Bank is acting as a principal, revenue is recognized on a gross basis in an amount corresponding to the consideration to which the Bank expects to be entitled. If the Bank is acting as an agent, then revenue is recognized net of the service fees and other costs incurred in relation to the commission and fees earned.\n\n## Underwriting and Advisory Fees\n\nUnderwriting and advisory fees include underwriting fees, financial advisory fees, and loan syndication fees. These fees are mainly earned in the Financial Markets segment and are recognized at a point in time as revenue upon successful completion of the engagement. Financial advisory fees are fees earned for assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Loan syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging, and administering a loan syndication and are recorded in Non-interest income unless the yield on the loan retained by the Bank is less than that of other comparable lenders involved in the financing. In such cases, an appropriate portion of the fees is deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method, and the amortization is recognized in Interest income over the term of the loan.\n\n## Securities Brokerage Commissions\n\nSecurities brokerage commissions are earned in the Wealth Management segment and are recognized when the transaction is executed.\n\n## Mutual Fund Revenues\n\nMutual fund revenues include management fees earned in the Wealth Management segment. Management fees are primarily calculated based on a fund's net asset value and are recorded in the period the services are performed.\n\n## Investment management and trust service fees\n\nInvestment management and trust service fees include management fees, trust service fees, and fees for other investment services provided to clients and earned in the Wealth Management segment. Generally, these fees are calculated using the balances of assets under administration and assets under management. Such fees are recognized in the period the service is performed.\n\n## Card Revenues\n\nCard revenues are earned in the Personal and Commercial segment and include card fees such as annual and transactional fees as well as interchange fees. Interchange fees are recognized when a card transaction is settled. Card fees are recognized on the transaction date except for annual fees, which are recorded evenly throughout the year. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to interchange fees.\n\n## Credit Fees and Deposit and Payment Service Charges\n\nCredit  fees  and  deposit  and  payment  service  charges  are  earned  in  the  Personal  and  Commercial,  Financial  Markets,  and  U.S. Specialty  Finance  and International segments. Credit fees are generally recognized in income over the period the services are provided. Deposit and payment service charges include fees related to account maintenance activities and transaction-based service charges. Fees related to account maintenance activities are recognized in the period the services are provided, whereas transaction-based service charges are recognized when the transaction is executed.\n\n## I Innssuurraannccee  RReevveennuueess\n\nInsurance contracts, including reinsurance contracts, are arrangements under which one party accepts significant insurance risk by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event was to occur. Gross premiums, net of premiums transferred under reinsurance contracts, are recognized when they become due. Royalties received from reinsurers are recognized when earned. Claims are recognized when received and an amount is estimated as they are being processed. All these amounts are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nUpon recognition of a premium, a reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized, respectively, in Other assets and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent changes in the carrying value of the reinsurance asset and insurance liability are recognized on a net basis in Non-interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

It is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates prevailing on the reporting date, and any adjustments recognized in the period for the current tax of prior periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and intends to settle on a net basis or to simultaneously realize the asset and settle the liability.\n\nDeferred tax is established based on temporary differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, in accordance with enacted or substantively enacted income tax laws and rates that will apply on the date the differences reverse. Deferred tax is not recognized for temporary differences related to the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 the initial accounting of goodwill;\n- \uf0b7 the initial accounting of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting income nor taxable income;\n- \uf0b7 investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and that the Bank controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference;\n- \uf0b7 investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures when it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future and that there will not be taxable income to which the temporary difference can be recognized.\n\nDeferred tax assets are tax benefits in the form of deductions that the Bank may claim to reduce its taxable income in future years. At the end of each reporting period, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is revised, and it is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to allow the benefit of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, and the net balance is presented in either Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Bank has a legally enforceable right to set off the current tax assets and liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on the same taxable entity or on different taxable entities that intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities based on their net amount.\n\nThe Bank makes assumptions to estimate income taxes as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities. This process includes estimating the actual amount of current taxes and evaluating tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences arising from differences between the values of items reported for accounting and for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet are calculated according to the tax rates to be applied in future periods. Previously recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities must be adjusted when the date of the future event is revised based on current information.\n\nThe Bank is subject to the jurisdictions of various tax authorities. In the normal course of its business, the Bank is involved in a number of transactions for which the tax impacts are uncertain. As a result, the Bank accounts for provisions for uncertain tax positions that adequately represent the tax risk stemming from tax matters under discussion or being audited by tax authorities or from other matters involving uncertainty. The amounts of these provisions reflect the best possible estimates of the amounts that may have to be paid based on qualitative assessments of all relevant factors. The provisions are estimated at the end of each reporting period. However, it is possible that, at a future date, a provision might need to be adjusted following an audit by the tax authorities. When the final assessment differs from the initially provisioned amounts, the difference will impact the income taxes of the period in which the assessment was made.\n\n## F Fiinnaanncciiaall  GGuuaarraanntteeee  CCoonnttrraaccttss\n\nA  financial  guarantee  contract  is  a  contract  or  indemnification  agreement  that  could  require  the  Bank  to  make  specified  payments  (in  cash,  financial instruments, other assets, Bank shares, or provisions of services) to reimburse a beneficiary in the event of a loss resulting from a debtor defaulting on the original or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nTo reflect the fair value of the obligation assumed at the inception of a financial guarantee, a liability is recorded in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. After initial recognition, the Bank must measure financial guarantee contracts at the higher of the allowance for credit losses determined using the ECL model and of the initially recognized amount less, where applicable, the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. This revenue is recognized in Credit fees in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Other post-employment benefit plans include post-employment medical, dental, and life insurance coverage. While pension plans are funded, the other plans are not.\n\nPlan expenses and obligations are actuarially determined based on the projected benefit method prorated on service. The calculations use management's best estimates of various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates, rates of compensation increase, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and retirement age.\n\nThe net asset or net liability of pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are calculated separately for each plan as the difference between the present value of the future benefits earned by employees in respect of current- and prior-period service and the fair value of plan assets. The net asset or net liability is included in either the Other assets or Other liabilities item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe expense related to pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans consists of the following items: current service cost, net interest on the net plan asset or liability, administration costs, and past service cost, if any, recognized when a plan is amended. This expense is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The net amount of interest income and expense is determined by applying a discount rate to the net plan asset or liability amount.\n\nRemeasurements resulting from pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans represent actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit obligation and the actual return on plan assets, excluding net interest determined by applying a discount rate to the net asset or liability of the plans. Remeasurements are immediately recognized in Other comprehensive income and will not be subsequently reclassified to net income; these cumulative gains and losses are reclassified to Retained earnings.\n\n## S Shhaarree--BBaasseedd  PPaayymmeennttss\n\nThe Bank has several share-based compensation plans: the Stock Option Plan, the Stock Appreciation Rights (SAR) Plan, the Deferred Stock Unit (DSU) Plan, the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan, the Performance Stock Unit (PSU) Plan, the Deferred Compensation Plan (DCP) of National Bank Financial, and the Employee Share Ownership Plan.\n\nCompensation expense is recognized over the service period required for employees to become fully entitled to the award. This period is generally the same as the vesting period, except where the required service period begins before the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees eligible to retire on the award date is immediately recognized on the award date. Compensation expense related to awards granted to employees who will become eligible to retire during the vesting period is recognized over the period from the award date to the date the employee becomes eligible to retire. For all of these plans, as of the first year of recognition, the expense includes cancellation and forfeiture estimates. These estimates are subsequently revised as necessary. The Bank uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the risks associated with some of these plans. The compensation expense for these plans, net of related hedges, is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nUnder the Stock Option Plan, the Bank uses the fair value method to account for stock options awarded. The options vest at 25% per year, and each tranche is treated as though it was a separate award. The fair value of each of the tranches is measured on the award date using the Black-Scholes model, and this fair value is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits and Contributed surplus. When the options are exercised, the Contributed surplus amount is credited to Equity - Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds received from the employees when these options are exercised are also credited to Equity - Common shares on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nSARs are recorded at fair value when awarded and their fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period until they are exercised. The cost is recognized in Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income and in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligation that results from the change in fair value at each period is recognized in net income gradually over the vesting period, and periodically thereafter, until the SARs are exercised.  When a SAR is exercised, the Bank makes a cash payment equal to the increase in the stock price since the date of the award.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

IFRS 17 introduces a new accounting framework that will improve the comparability and quality of financial information. IFRS 17 provides guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. In June 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 17 that included a two-year deferral of the effective date along with other changes aimed at addressing concerns and implementation challenges identified after IFRS 17 was published in 2017. IFRS 17, as amended, is to be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, with earlier application permitted.

When there is no quoted price in an active market, the Bank applies other valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and that minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Such valuation techniques include the following: using information available from recent market transactions, referring to the current fair value of a comparable financial instrument, applying discounted cash flow analysis, applying option pricing models, or relying on any other valuation technique that is commonly used by market participants and has proven to yield reliable estimates. Judgment is required when applying many of the valuation techniques. The Bank's valuation was based on its assessment of the conditions prevailing as at October 31, 2021 and may change in the future. Furthermore, there may be valuation uncertainty resulting from the choice of valuation model used.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank has policies and procedures that govern the process for determining fair value. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management Group. All valuation models are validated, and controls have been implemented to ensure that they are applied.\n\nThe fair value of existing or new products is determined and validated by functions independent of the risk-taking team. Complex fair value matters are reviewed by valuation committees made up of experts from various specialized functions.\n\nFor financial instruments classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the Bank has documented the hierarchy classification policies, and there are controls in place to ensure that fair value is measured appropriately, reliably, and consistently. Valuation methods and the underlying assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## VVaalluuaattiioonn  MMeetthhooddss  aanndd  AAssssuummppttiioonnss\n\n## Financial Instruments Whose Fair Value Equals Carrying Value\n\nThe carrying value of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 cash and deposits with financial institutions;\n- \uf0b7 securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed;\n- \uf0b7 obligations related to securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities loaned;\n- \uf0b7 customers' liability under acceptances;\n- \uf0b7 acceptances;\n- \uf0b7 certain items of other assets and other liabilities.\n\n## Securities and Obligations Related to Securities Sold Short\n\nThese financial instruments, except for securities at amortized cost, are recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Their fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets, i.e., bid prices for financial assets and offered prices for financial liabilities. If there are no quoted prices in an active market, fair value is estimated using prices for securities that, in substance, are identical. If such prices are not available, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices, the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, credit risk, interest rate yield curves and currency rates.\n\nWhen one or more significant inputs are not observable in the markets, fair value is established primarily using internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the characteristics specific to the financial asset or liability, and other relevant factors.\n\n## Securities Issued or Guaranteed by Governments\n\nSecurities issued or guaranteed by governments include government debt securities of the governments of Canada (federal, provincial and municipal) as well as debt securities of the U.S. government (U.S. Treasury), of other U.S. agencies and of other foreign governments. The fair value of these securities is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets. For those classified in Level 2, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in active markets are used to determine fair value. In the absence of an observable market, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities.\n\n## Equity Securities and Other Debt Securities\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is determined primarily by using quoted prices in active markets. For equity securities and other debt securities classified in Level 2, a valuation technique based on quoted prices of identical and similar instruments in an active market is used to determine fair value. In the absence of observable inputs, valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method could be used, incorporating assumptions on benchmark yields (CDOR, LIBOR and other) and the risk spreads of similar securities. For those classified in Level 3, fair value can be determined based on the net asset value, which represents  the  estimated  value  of  a  security  based  on  valuations  received  from  investment  or  fund  managers  or  the  general  partners  of  the  limited partnerships. Fair value can also be determined using internal valuation techniques adjusted for risk factors related to the financial instruments and for economic conditions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Note 3  --  Fair Value of Financial Instruments (cont.)\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For exchange-traded derivative financial instruments, fair value is based on a quoted price in an active market.\n\nFor over-the-counter (OTC) derivative financial instruments, fair value is determined using well established valuation techniques that incorporate assumptions based primarily on observable market inputs such as current market prices and the contractual prices of the underlying instruments, the time value of money, interest rate yield curves, credit curves, currency rates as well as price and rate volatility factors. In establishing the fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments, the Bank also incorporates the following factors:\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)\n\nThe CVA is a valuation adjustment applied to derivative financial instruments to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty. For each counterparty, the CVA is based on the expected positive exposure and probabilities of default through time. The exposures are determined by incorporating relevant factors such as current and potential future market values, master netting arrangements, collateral agreements and expected recovery rates. The default probabilities are inferred  using  credit  default  swap  (CDS)  spreads.  When  unavailable,  relevant  proxies  are  used.  While  the  general  methodology  currently  assumes independence between expected positive exposures and probabilities of default, adjustments are applied to certain types of transactions where there is a direct link between the exposure at default and the default probabilities.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA)\n\nThe  FVA  is  a  valuation  adjustment  applied  to  derivative  financial  instruments  to  reflect  the  market-implied  cost  or  benefits  of  funding  collateral  for uncollateralized or partly collateralized transactions. The expected exposures are determined using methodologies consistent with the CVA framework. The funding level used to determine the FVA is based on the average funding level of relevant market participants.\n\nWhen the valuation techniques incorporate one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the markets, the fair value of OTC derivative financial instruments is established primarily on the basis of internal estimates and data that consider the valuation policies in effect at the Bank, economic conditions, the characteristics specific to the financial asset or financial liability, and other relevant factors.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe fair value of fixed-rate mortgage loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows, adjusted for several factors, including prepayment options, current market interest rates for similar loans, and other relevant variables where applicable. The fair value of variable-rate mortgage loans is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\nThe fair value of other fixed-rate loans is determined by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using current market interest rates charged for similar new loans. The fair value of other variable-rate loans is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe fair value of fixed-term deposits is determined primarily by discounting expected future contractual cash flows and considering several factors such as redemption options and market interest rates currently offered for financial instruments with similar conditions. For certain term funding instruments, fair value is determined using market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of demand deposits and notice deposits is deemed to equal carrying value.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  structured  deposit  notes  is  established  using  valuation  models  that  maximize  the  use  of  observable  inputs  when  available,  such  as benchmark indices, and also incorporates the Bank's own credit risk. In calculating the Bank's own credit risk, the market implied spreads of the Bank are used to infer its probabilities of default. Lastly, when fair value is determined using option pricing models, the valuation techniques are similar to those described for derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Liabilities Related to Transferred Receivables\n\nThese liabilities arise from sale transactions to Canada Housing Trust (CHT) of securities backed by insured residential mortgages and other securities under the Canada Mortgage Bond (CMB) program. These transactions do not qualify for derecognition. They are recorded as guaranteed borrowings, which results in the recording of liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of these liabilities is established using valuation techniques based on observable market inputs such as Canada Mortgage Bond prices.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

If there is no active market, fair value is determined by discounting contractual cash flows using the current market interest rates offered for similar financial instruments that have the same term to maturity.\n\n## H Hiieerraarrcchhyy  ooff  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  MMeeaassuurreemmeennttss\n\n## D Deetteerrmmiinniinngg  tthhee  LLeevveellss  ooff  tthhee  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  HHiieerraarrcchhyy\n\nIFRS establishes a fair value measurement hierarchy that classifies the inputs used in financial instrument fair value measurement techniques according to three levels. This fair value hierarchy requires observable market inputs to be used whenever such inputs exist. According to the hierarchy, the highest level of inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments and the lowest level of inputs are unobservable inputs. If inputs from different levels  of  the  hierarchy  are  used,  the  financial  instrument  is  classified  in  the  same  level  as  the  lowest  level  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement. The fair value measurement hierarchy has the following levels:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs corresponding to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and accessible to the Bank at the measurement date. These instruments consist primarily of equity securities, derivative financial instruments traded in active markets, and certain highly liquid debt securities actively traded in over-the-counter markets.\n\n## Level 2\n\nValuation techniques based on inputs, other than the quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs, that are directly or indirectly observable in the market for the asset or liability. These inputs are quoted prices of similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices used in a valuation model that are observable for that instrument; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market inputs by correlation or other means. These instruments consist primarily of certain loans, certain deposits, derivative financial instruments traded in over-the-counter markets, certain debt securities, certain equity securities whose value is not directly observable in an active market, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and certain other liabilities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nValuation techniques based on one or more significant inputs that are not observable in the market for the asset or liability. The Bank classifies financial instruments in Level 3 when the valuation technique is based on at least one significant input that is not observable in the markets. The valuation technique may also be partly based on observable market inputs.\n\nFinancial instruments whose fair values are classified in Level 3 consist of the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss: investments in hedge funds for which there are certain restrictions on unit or security redemptions, equity securities and debt securities of private companies, as well as certain derivative financial instruments whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs;\n- \uf0b7 securities at fair value through other comprehensive income: equity and debt securities of private companies;\n- \uf0b7 certain loans and certain deposits (structured deposit notes) whose fair value is established using internal valuation models that are based on significant unobservable market inputs.\n\n## T Trraannssffeerrss  BBeettwweeeenn  tthhee  FFaaiirr  VVaalluuee  HHiieerraarrcchhyy  LLeevveellss\n\nTransfers of financial instruments between Levels 1 and 2 and transfers to (or from) Level 3 are deemed to have taken place at the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurred. Significant transfers can occur between the fair value hierarchy levels due to new information on inputs used to determine fair value and the observable nature of those inputs.\n\nDuring fiscal 2021, $31 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss and $2 million in obligations related to securities sold short were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 resulting from changing market conditions ($15 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss in fiscal 2020). In addition, during fiscal 2021, $30 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 resulting from changing market conditions (for fiscal 2020, $10 million in securities classified as at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nDuring fiscal years 2021 and 2020, financial instruments were transferred to (or from) Level 3 due to changes in the availability of observable market inputs resulting from changing market conditions.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The net asset value of a fund is the total fair value of assets less liabilities.\n\n## EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) Multiple and Price Equivalent\n\nPrivate equity valuation inputs include earnings multiples, which are determined based on comparable companies, and a higher multiple will translate into a higher fair value. Price equivalent is a percentage of the market price based on the liquidity of the security.\n\n## Credit Spread\n\nA credit spread (yield) is the difference between the instrument's yield and a benchmark yield. Benchmark instruments have high credit quality ratings with similar maturities. The credit spread therefore represents the discount rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows of an asset to reflect the market return required for credit quality in the estimated cash flows. A higher credit spread will result in a lower value.\n\n## Discount Rate\n\nThe discount rate is the input used to bring future cash flows to their present value. A higher discount rate will translate into a lower fair value.\n\n## Liquidity Premium\n\nA liquidity premium may be applied when few or no transactions exist to support the valuations. A higher liquidity premium will result in a lower value.\n\n## Long-Term Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the expected future variability of market prices. Volatility is generally observable in the market through options prices. However, the long-term volatility of options with a longer maturity might not be observable. An increase (decrease) in long-term volatility is generally associated with an increase (decrease) in long-term correlation. Higher long-term volatility may increase or decrease an instrument's fair value depending on its terms.\n\n## Market Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two different variables. A positive correlation means that the variables tend to move in the same direction; a negative correlation means that the variables tend to move in opposite directions. Correlation is used to measure financial instruments whose future returns depend on several variables. Changes in correlation will either increase or decrease a financial instrument's fair value depending on the terms of its contractual payout.\n\n## S Seennssiittiivviittyy  AAnnaallyyssiiss  ooff  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeennttss  CCllaassssiiffiieedd  iinn  LLeevveell  33\n\nThe Bank performs sensitivity analyses for the fair value measurements of financial instruments classified in Level 3, substituting unobservable inputs with one or more reasonably possible alternative assumptions.\n\nFor equity securities and other debt securities,  the Bank varies significant unobservable inputs such as net asset values, EV/EBITDA multiples, or price equivalents  and  establishes  a  reasonable  fair  value  range  that  could  result  in  a  $115 million  increase  or  decrease  in  the  fair  value  recorded  as  at October 31, 2021 (a $102 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2020).\n\nFor loans, the Bank varies unobservable inputs such as a liquidity premium and establishes a reasonable fair value range that could result in a $28 million increase or decrease in the fair value recorded as at October 31, 2021 (a $57 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2020).\n\nFor derivative financial instruments and embedded derivative financial instruments related to structured deposit notes, the Bank varies long-term volatility, market  correlation  inputs,  and  the  liquidity  premium  and  establishes  a  reasonable  fair  value  range.  As  at  October 31,  2021,  for  derivative  financial instruments, the net fair value could result in a $1 million increase or decrease (a $12 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2020), whereas for structured deposit notes, the net fair value could have resulted in a $1 million increase or decrease as at October 31, 2020.\n\nFor all Level 3 financial instruments, the reasonable fair value ranges could result in an 5% increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2021 (an 8% increase or decrease in net income as at October 31, 2020).\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Consistent with its risk management strategy and in accordance with the fair value option, which permits the designation if it eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring financial assets and liabilities or recognizing the gains and losses thereon on different bases, the Bank designated at fair value through profit or loss certain securities, and certain liabilities related to transferred receivables. The fair value of liabilities related to transferred receivables does not include credit risk, as the holders of these liabilities are not exposed to the Bank's credit risk. The Bank also designated certain deposits that include embedded derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nTo determine a change in fair value arising from a change in the credit risk of deposits designated at fair value through profit or loss, the Bank calculates, at the beginning of the period, the present value of the instrument's contractual cash flows using the following rates: first, using an observed discount rate for similar securities that reflects the Bank's credit spread and, then, using a rate that excludes the Bank's credit spread. The difference obtained between the two values is then compared to the difference obtained using the same rates at the end of the period.\n\nInformation about the financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss is provided in the following tables.\n\n|

If the netting criteria are met, these transactions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, as part of these transactions, the Bank may give or receive cash or other financial instruments used as collateral.\n\nThe following tables present information on financial assets and financial liabilities that are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheet because they meet the netting criteria and on those that are not netted and are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.\n\n|                                               | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211   | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211   | A Ass  aatt

The Bank has policies and procedures that govern impairments arising from credit risk. These policies are documented and periodically reviewed by the Risk Management group. All models used to calculate expected credit losses are validated, and controls are in place to ensure they are applied.\n\nThese models are validated by groups that are independent of the team that prepares the calculations. Complex questions on measurement methodologies and assumptions are reviewed by a group of experts from various functions. Furthermore, the inputs and assumptions used to determine expected credit losses are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n## MMeeaassuurreemmeenntt  ooff  EExxppeecctteedd  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  ((EECCLL))\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated using three main variables: (1) probability of default (PD), (2) loss given default (LGD) and (3) exposure at default (EAD). For accounting purposes, 12-month PD and lifetime PD are the probabilities of a default occurring over the next 12 months or over the life of a financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and on future economic conditions that have, or will have, an impact on credit risk. LGD reflects the losses expected should default occur and considers such factors as the mitigating effects of collateral, the realizable value thereof, and the time value of money. EAD is the expected balance owing at default and considers such factors as repayments of principal and interest between the balance sheet date and the time of default as well as any amounts expected to be drawn on a committed facility. Twelve-month expected credit losses are estimated by multiplying 12-month PD by LGD and by EAD. Lifetime expected credit losses are estimated using the lifetime PD.\n\nFor most financial instruments, expected credit losses are measured on an individual basis. Financial instruments that have credit losses measured on a collective basis are grouped according to similar credit risk characteristics such as type of instrument, geographic location, comparable risk level, and business sector or industry.\n\n## I Innppuuttss,,  AAssssuummppttiioonnss  aanndd  EEssttiimmaattiioonn  TTeecchhnniiqquueess\n\nThe Bank's approach to calculating expected credit losses consists essentially of leveraging existing regulatory models and then adjusting their parameters for IFRS 9 purposes. These models have the advantage of having been thoroughly tested and validated. In addition, using the same base models, regardless of the purpose, provides consistency across risk assessments. These models use inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques that require a high degree of management judgment. The main factors that contribute to changes in ECL that are subject to significant judgment include the following:\n\n- \uf0b7 calibration of regulatory parameters in order to obtain point-in-time and forward-looking parameters;\n- \uf0b7 forecasts of macroeconomic variables for multiple scenarios and the probability weighting of the scenarios;\n- \uf0b7 determination of the significant increases in credit risk (SICR) of a loan.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "## Main Parameters\n\n## PD Estimates\n\nSince the objective of the regulatory calibration of PD is to align historical data to the long-run default rate, adjustments are required to obtain a point-in-time, forward-looking PD, as required by IFRS 9. The Bank performs the following: (1) A point-in-time calibration, where the PD of the portfolio is aligned with the appropriate default rate. The resulting PD estimate generally equals the prior-year default rate. The prior-year default rate is selected for the calibration performed  at  this  stage,  as  it  often  reflects  one  of  the  most  accurate  and  appropriate  estimates  of  the  current-year  default  rate;  (2)  Forward-looking adjustments are incorporated through, among other measures, a calibration factor based on forecasts produced by the stress testing team's analyses. The team considers three macroeconomic scenarios, and, for each scenario, produces a forward-looking assessment covering the three upcoming years.\n\n## LGD Estimates\n\nThe LGD estimation method consists of using, for each of the three macroeconomic scenarios, expected LGD based on the LGD values observed using backtesting, the economic LGD estimated and used to calculate economic capital, and lastly, the estimated downturn LGD used to calculate regulatory capital.\n\n## EAD Estimates\n\nFor term loans, the Bank uses expected EAD, which is the outstanding balance anticipated at each point in time. Expected EAD decreases over time according to contractual repayments and to prepayments. For revolving loans, the EAD percentage is based on the percentage estimated by the corresponding regulatory model and, thereafter, is converted to dollars according to the authorized balance.\n\n## Expected Life\n\nFor most financial instruments, the expected life used when measuring expected credit losses is the remaining contractual life. For revolving financial instruments where there is no contractual maturity, such as credit cards or lines of credit, the expected life is based on the behavioural life of clients who have defaulted or closed their account.\n\n## Incorporation of Forward-Looking Information\n\nThe Bank's Economy and Strategy Group is responsible for developing three macroeconomic scenarios and for recommending probability weights for each scenario. Macroeconomic scenarios are not developed for specific portfolios, as the Economy and Strategy Group provides a set of variables for each of the defined scenarios for the next three years. The PDs are also adjusted to incorporate economic assumptions (interest rates, unemployment rates, GDP forecasts, oil prices, housing price indices, etc.) that can be statistically tied to PD changes that will have an impact beyond the next 12 months. These statistical relationships are determined using the processes developed for stress testing. In addition, the group considers other relevant factors that may not be adequately reflected in the information used to calculate the PDs (including late payments and whether the financial asset is subject to additional monitoring within the watchlist process for business and government loan portfolios).\n\n## Determination of a Significant Increase in the Credit Risk of a Financial Instrument\n\nAt each reporting period, the Bank determines whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by examining the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. First, the Bank compares the point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD at the reporting date with the expected point-in-time forward-looking remaining lifetime PD established at initial recognition. Based on this comparison, the Bank determines whether the loan has deteriorated when compared to the initial conditions. Because the comparison includes an adjustment based on originationdate forward-looking information and reporting-date forward-looking information, the deterioration may be caused by the following factors: (i) deterioration of the economic outlook used in the forward-looking assessment; (ii) deterioration of the borrower's conditions (payment defaults, worsening financial ratios, etc.); or (iii) a combination of both factors. The quantitative criteria used to determine a significant increase in credit risk are a series of relative and absolute thresholds, and a backstop is also applied. All financial instruments that are over 30 days past due but below 90 days past due are migrated to Stage 2, even if the other criteria do not indicate a significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  QQuuaalliittyy  ooff  LLooaannss\n\nThe following tables present the gross carrying amounts of loans as at October 31, 2021 and 2020, according to credit quality and ECL impairment stage of each loan category at amortized cost, and according to credit quality for loans at fair value through profit or loss.

The main macroeconomic factors used for the business and government credit portfolio are unemployment rate, spread on corporate BBB bonds, S&P/TSX growth, and WTI oil price.\n\nAn  increase  in  unemployment  rate  or  BBB  spread  will  generally  correlate  with  higher  allowances  for  credit  losses,  whereas  an  increase  in  the  other macroeconomic factors (GDP, S&P/TSX, housing price index and WTI oil price) will generally correlate with lower allowances for credit losses.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

        "page_content": "During the year ended October 31, 2021, the macroeconomic outlook generally improved.\n\nAccording to the base scenario, the Canadian economy will continue to recover as vaccines allow for a gradual easing of health measures. The labour market will continue to bounce back, and the unemployment rate will stand at 6.4% after 12 months but remain slightly above its pre-recession level (5.7%). The increase in housing prices will slow to 2.0% year over year. The S&P/TSX will stand at 21,370 points after one year, with the price of oil at US$66.\n\nAccording to the upside scenario, the economy will rebound more strongly as a result of effective vaccination campaigns, particularly against variants, and as a result of improvements in supply chains. Consumer spending will trend upward given the excess savings accumulated since the start of the pandemic. The unemployment rate one year after the scenario will be more favourable than the base scenario (five-tenths lower). Housing prices will climb 4.0%, and the S&P/TSX will stand at 22,160 points after one year, with the price of oil at US$80.\n\nAccording to the downside scenario, vaccines will prove to be ineffective against certain variants, and the economy will be adversely affected by new lockdown measures. Supply chain bottlenecks will hinder profitability. Governments will continue to support households and businesses, but, due to budgetary constraints, will not be able to match the generosity of the programs adopted at the start of the pandemic. This will cause the economy to tumble and slip back into recession. The unemployment rate will therefore trend upward to 10.3% after 12 months. Housing prices will decrease considerably. The S&P/TSX will stand at 15,170 points after one year, with the price of oil at US$24.\n\nGiven uncertainty surrounding key inputs used to measure credit losses, the Bank has applied expert credit judgment to adjust the modelled ECL results.\n\n## S Seennssiittiivviittyy  AAnnaallyyssiiss  ooff  AAlllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  CCrreeddiitt  LLoosssseess  oonn  NNoonn--IImmppaaiirreedd  LLooaannss\n\n## S Scceennaarriiooss\n\nThe following table shows a comparison of the Bank's allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans (Stages 1 and 2) as at October 31, 2021 based on the probability weightings of three scenarios with allowances for credit losses resulting from simulations of each scenario weighted at 100%.\n\n|                                                               | A Alllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  ccrreeddiitt  lloosssseess   o onn  nnoonn--iimmppaaiirreedd  llooaannss   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| B Baallaannccee  aass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211 | 8 85511                                                                                                   |\n| S Siimmuullaattiioonnss                                       |                                                                                                           |\n| 100% upside scenario                                          | 5 58833                                                                                                   |\n| 100% base scenario                                            | 6 62266                                                                                                   |\n| 100% downside scenario                                        | 1 1,,228811                                                                                               |\n\n## M Miiggrraattiioonn\n\nThe following table shows a comparison of the Bank's allowances for credit losses on non-impaired loans (Stages 1 and 2) as at October 31, 2021 with the estimated allowances for credit losses that would result if all these non-impaired loans were in Stage 1.\n\n| B Baallaannccee  aass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211   | A Alllloowwaanncceess  ffoorr  ccrreeddiitt  lloosssseess   o onn  nnoonn--iimmppaaiirreedd  llooaannss   8 85511   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| S Siimmuullaattiioonnss                                         |                                                                                                                     |\n| Non-impaired loans if they were all in Stage 1                  | 6 68888                                                                                                             |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The risks include credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, prepayment risk and other price risks, whereas the rewards include income streams associated with the financial assets. As such, those financial assets are not derecognized and the transactions are treated as collateralized or secured borrowings.

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the recoverable value of the CGU or group of CGUs may have fallen below its carrying amount.\n\nGoodwill was tested for impairment during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, and no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nThe recoverable value of a CGU or group of CGUs is based on the value in use that is calculated based on discounted pre-tax cash flows. Future pre-tax cash flows are estimated based on a five-year period, which is the reference period used for the most recent financial forecasts approved by management. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate.\n\nThe discount rate used for each CGU or group of CGUs is calculated using the cost of debt financing and the cost related to the Bank's equity. This rate corresponds to the Bank's weighted average cost of capital and reflects the risk specific to the CGU. The long-term growth rate used in calculating discounted cash flow estimates is based on the forecasted growth rate plus a risk premium. The rate is constant over the entire five-year period for which the cash flows were determined. Growth rates are determined, among other factors, based on past growth rates, economic trends, inflation, competition and the impact of the Bank's strategic initiatives. As at October 31, 2021, for each CGU or CGU group, the discount rate used was 13.2% (13.2% as at October 31, 2020), and the long-term growth rate varied between 2% and 5%, depending on the CGU, as at October 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Such  sensitivity  analyses demonstrate that a reasonable change in assumptions would not result in a CGU's carrying value exceeding its value in use.\n\n## I Innttaannggiibbllee  AAsssseettss\n\n|                                                                             | IInnddeeffiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee    | IInnddeeffiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee   | IInnddeeffiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee   | F Fiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee     T Toottaall                 | F Fiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee     T Toottaall   | F Fiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee     T Toottaall   | F Fiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee     T Toottaall   | F Fiinniittee  uusseeffuull  lliiffee     T Toottaall   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                             | M Maannaaggeemmeenntt   c coonnttrraaccttss (1) | T Trraaddeemmaarrkk                            | T Toottaall                                    | I Inntteerrnnaallllyy--   g geenneerraatteedd   s sooffttwwaarree (2) | O Otthheerr   s sooffttwwaarree                         | O Otthheerr   i innttaannggiibbllee   a asssseettss     | T Toottaall                                             |                                                         |\n| C Coosstt                                                                   |                                                 |                                                |                                                |                                                                       |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |                                                         |\n| As at October 31, 2019                                                      | 161                                             | 11                                             | 172                                            | 1,703                                                                 | 156                                                     | 103                                                     | 1,962                                                   | 2,134                                                   |\n| Acquisitions                                                                | -

Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is subject to the same credit approval, credit limit, and credit monitoring standards as those applied to the Bank's other credit transactions. Consequently, the Bank evaluates the creditworthiness of counterparties and manages the size of the portfolios as well as the diversification and maturity profiles of these financial instruments.\n\nThe Bank limits the credit risk of over-the-counter contracts by dealing with creditworthy counterparties and entering into contracts that provide for the exchange of collateral between parties where the fair value of the outstanding transactions exceeds an agreed threshold. The Bank also negotiates master netting agreements that provide for the simultaneous close-out and settling of all transactions with a given counterparty in the event of default, insolvency, or bankruptcy. However, overall exposure to credit risk, reduced through master netting agreements, may change substantially after the balance sheet date because it is affected by all transactions subject to a contract as well as by changes in the market rates of the underlying instruments.\n\nThe Bank also uses financial intermediaries to have access to established clearing houses in order to minimize the settlement risk arising from financial derivative transactions. In some cases, the Bank has direct access to clearing houses for settling derivative financial instruments. In addition, certain derivative financial instruments traded over the counter are settled directly or indirectly by central counterparties.\n\nIn the case of exchange-traded contracts, exposure to credit risk is limited because these transactions are standardized contracts executed on established exchanges, each of which is associated with a well-capitalized clearing house that assumes the obligations of both counterparties and guarantees their performance obligations. All exchange-traded contracts are subject to initial margins and daily settlement.\n\n## TTeerrmmss  UUsseedd\n\n## Replacement Cost\n\nReplacement cost is the Bank's maximum credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments as at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. This amount is the positive fair value of all derivative financial instruments, before all master netting agreements and collateral held.\n\n## Credit Risk Equivalent\n\nThe credit risk equivalent amount is the total replacement cost plus an amount representing the potential future credit risk exposure, as outlined in OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements Guideline.\n\n## Risk-Weighted Amount\n\nThe risk-weighted amount is determined by applying the OSFI guidance to the credit risk equivalent.\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  EExxppoossuurree  ooff  tthhee  DDeerriivvaattiivvee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeenntt  PPoorrttffoolliioo\n\n| As at October 31                                  |                                     |                                                     |                                                     | 2020              | 2020                        | 2020                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                   | R Reeppllaacceemmeenntt   c coosstt | C Crreeddiitt  rriisskk   e eqquuiivvaalleenntt (1) | R Riisskk--   w weeiigghhtteedd   a ammoouunntt (1) | Replacement  cost | Credit risk  equivalent (1) | Risk-  weighted  amount (1) |\n| Interest rate contracts                           | 1 1,,997755                         | 3 3,,223399                                         | 8 81144                                             | 3,534             | 3,839                       | 1,383                       |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                        | 6 6,,445533                         | 4 4,,336611                                         | 1 1,,440055                                         | 4,391             | 4,829                       | 1,542                       |\n| Equity, commodity and credit derivative contracts | 8 8,,005566                         | 1 122,,111133                                       | 3 3,,331166                                         | 5,497             | 7,874                       | 1,820                       |\n|                                                   | 1 166,,448844                       | 1 199,,771133                                       | 5 5,,553355                                         | 13,422            | 16,542                      | 4,745                       |\n| Impact of master netting agreements               | ( (99,,339988))                     |                                                     |                                                     | (6,204)           |                             |                             |\n|                                                   | 7 7,,008866                         | 1 199,,771133                                       | 5 5,,553355                                         | 7,218             | 16,542                      | 4,745                       |\n\n## C Crreeddiitt  RRiisskk  EExxppoossuurree  ooff  tthhee  DDeerriivvaattiivvee  FFiinnaanncciiaall  IInnssttrruummeenntt  PPoorrttffoolliioo  bbyy  CCoouunntteerrppaarrttyy\n\n| As at October 31                     | 2 2002211                           | 2 2002211                                       | 2020              | 2020                    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                      | R Reeppllaacceemmeenntt   c coosstt | C Crreeddiitt  rriisskk   e eqquuiivvaalleenntt | Replacement  cost | Credit risk  equivalent |\n| OECD (1)  member-country governments | 7 77711                             | 2 2,,660044                                     | 1,265             | 2,280                   |\n| Banks of OECD member countries       | 7 71144                             | 3 3,,449922                                     | 837               | 3,399                   |\n| Other                                | 5 5,,660011                         | 1 133,,661177                                   | 5,116             | 10,863                  |\n|                                      | 7 7,,008866                         | 1 199,,771133                                   | 7,218             | 16,542                  |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments offset changes in the fair value of the hedged items. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to portfolios of securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, fixed-rate mortgage loans, fixed-rate deposits, liabilities related to transferred receivables, and subordinated debt.\n\nIn addition, when a fixed-rate asset or liability is denominated in a foreign currency, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the associated foreign exchange risk. The Bank may designate a cross-currency swap to exchange the fixed-rate foreign currency for the functional currency at a floating rate in a single hedging relationship addressing both interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to foreign currency fixed-rate deposits.\n\nRegression  analysis  is  used  to  test  hedge  effectiveness  and  determine  the  hedge  ratio.  For  fair  value  hedges,  the  main  source  of  potential  hedge ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned.\n\nThe following tables show amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the fair value hedges.\n\n|                                                             | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211                     | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211                                                           | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211                                                           | Y Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211                                                                                           | Y Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211                                                                                                         | Y Yeeaarr  eennddeedd  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                             | C Caarrrryyiinngg  vvaalluuee   o off  hheeddggeedd   i itteemmss | C Cuummuullaattiivvee   h heeddggee   a addjjuussttmmeennttss   f frroomm  aaccttiivvee   h heeddggeess | C Cuummuullaattiivvee   a addjjuussttmmeennttss   f frroomm   d diissccoonnttiinnuueedd   h heeddggeess | G Gaaiinnss  ((lloosssseess))   o onn  tthhee  hheeddggeedd   i itteemmss  ffoorr   i inneeffffeeccttiivveenneessss   m meeaassuurreemmeenntt (1) | G Gaaiinnss  ((lloosssseess))   o onn  tthhee  hheeddggiinngg   i innssttrruummeennttss  ffoorr   i inneeffffeeccttiivveenneessss   m meeaassuurreemmeenntt (1) | H Heeddggee   i inneeffffeeccttiivveenneessss (1)         |\n| Securities at fair value through other comprehensive income | 7 7,,447711                                                       | ( (118833))                                                                                             | 2 277                                                                                                   | ( (330099))                                                                                                                                       | 3 31100                                                                                                                                                         | 1 1                                                       |\n| Mortgages                                                   | 7 7,,660099                                                       | ( (119922))                                                                                             | ( (1177))                                                                                               | ( (222222))                                                                                                                                       | 2 23344                                                                                                                                                         | 1 122                                                     |\n| Deposits                                                    | 3 3,,119900                                                       | 4 422                                                                                                   | 7 700                                                                                                   | 1 12211                                                                                                                                           | ( (112233))                                                                                                                                                     | ( (22))                                                   |\n| Liabilities related to transferred receivables              | 1 10055                                                           | -

In addition, the Bank sometimes uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk caused by assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In certain cases, given that interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk are hedged in a single hedging relationship, the information below does not distinguish between interest rate risk and the combination of interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk as two separate risk categories. The Bank applies this strategy mainly to its loan, personal credit line, acceptance, and deposit portfolios as well as liabilities related to transferred receivables.\n\nThe Bank also uses total return swaps to hedge the risk of changes in future cash flows related to the Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Plan. Some of these swaps are designated as part of a cash flow hedge against a portion of the unrecognized obligation of the RSU Plan. In cash flow hedges, the derivative financial instruments used as hedging instruments reduce the variability of the future cash flows related to the hedged items.\n\nRegression analysis is used to assess hedge effectiveness and to determine the hedge ratio. For cash flow hedges, the main source of potential hedge ineffectiveness is a circumstance where the critical terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are not closely aligned.\n\nThe following tables show the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the cash flow hedges.\n\n|                                                 | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,

The Bank measures this risk by assessing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and hedges it using derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (crosscurrency swaps and deposits). In a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), the financial instruments used offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the investments. When non-derivative financial instruments are designated as foreign exchange risk hedges, only the changes in fair value that are attributable to foreign exchange risk are taken into account when assessing and calculating the effectiveness of the hedge.\n\nAssessing the effectiveness of net investment hedges consists of comparing changes in the carrying value of the deposits or the fair value of the derivative attributable to exchange rate fluctuations with changes in the net investment in a foreign operation attributable to exchange rate fluctuations. Inasmuch as the notional amount of the hedging instruments and the hedged net investments are aligned, no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nThe following tables present the amounts related to hedged items as well as the results of the net investment hedges.\n\n|                                                       | A Ass  aatt  OOccttoobbeerr  3311,,  22002211

Dividends are payable semi-annually and the dividend rate is the Government of Canada bond yield on the calculation date plus the reset premium; however, no dividend will be payable before the date on which all Series 44 and Series 45 preferred shares are issued to the holders of LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2. Upon the occurrence of a trigger event, as defined by OSFI; (i) each LRCN will be automatically redeemed and the redemption price will be covered by delivery of the trust's assets that consist of Series 44 and Series 45 preferred shares; (ii) each outstanding preferred share will be automatically and immediately converted on a full and permanent basis, without the consent of the holder, into a number of Bank common shares determined pursuant to an automatic conversion formula. This conversion will be calculated by dividing the value of the preferred shares, i.e., $1,000 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid interest as at the date of the trigger event, by the value of the common shares. The value of the common shares will be the greater of a $5.00 floor price or the current market price of the common shares. Current market price means the volume weighted average trading price of common shares for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the trading day preceding the date of the trigger event. If the common shares are not listed on an exchange when this price is being established, the price will be the fair value reasonably determined by the Bank's Board.\n- (10) The LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2 are notes for which recourse is limited to the assets held by an independent trustee in a consolidated limited recourse trust. The trust assets consist of Series 44 and Series 45 preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2. In the event of (i) non-payment of interest on any of the interest payment dates, (ii) non-payment of the redemption amount upon redemption of the LRCN, (iii) non-payment of the principal amount upon maturity of the LRCN, or (iv) an event of default in respect of the LRCN, the noteholders will have recourse only to the assets of the trust, and each noteholder will be entitled to its pro rata share of the assets of the trust. In such circumstances, delivery of the assets of the trust will eliminate all of the Bank's obligations with respect to the LRCN. The LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2 are redeemable at maturity or earlier to the extent that the Bank redeems the Series 44 and Series 45 preferred shares on certain redemption dates specified in the terms and conditions of the preferred shares, and subject to OSFI's consent and approval.\n\n- (13) The dividend period begins as of the date fixed for redemption. The amount of the floating quarterly non-cumulative dividend is determined by multiplying by $25.00 the rate of interest equal to the sum of the 90-day Government of Canada treasury bill yield on the floating rate calculation date, plus the reset premium.\n\n## Second Preferred Shares\n\n15 million shares without par value, issuable for a total maximum consideration of $300 million.

The trust's assets consist of $500 million of Series 45 first preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 2. The LRCN - Series 2 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.05% per annum until August 15, 2026 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 3.045% until August 15, 2076. The LRCN - Series 2 will mature on August 15, 2081.\n\nOn September 9, 2020, the Bank had issued $500 million of LRCN - Series 1 for which recourse of the noteholders is limited to the assets held by an independent trustee in a consolidated limited recourse trust. The trust's assets consist of $500 million of Series 44 first preferred shares issued by the Bank in conjunction with the LRCN - Series 1. The LRCN - Series 1 sell for $1,000 each and bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.30% per annum until November 15, 2025 exclusively and, thereafter, at an annual rate equal to the five-year Government of Canada bond yield plus 3.943% until November 15, 2075. The LRCN Series 1 will mature on November 15, 2080.\n\nIn the event of (i) non-payment of interest on any of the interest payment dates, (ii) non-payment of the redemption amount upon redemption of the LRCN, (iii) non-payment of the principal amount upon maturity of the LRCN, or (iv) an event of default in respect of the notes, the noteholders will have recourse only to the assets of the trust, and each noteholder will be entitled to its pro rata share of the assets of the trust. In such circumstances, delivery of the assets of the trust will eliminate all of the Bank's obligations with respect to the LRCN. The LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2 are redeemable at maturity or earlier to the extent that the Bank redeems the Series 44 and Series 45 preferred shares on certain redemption dates specified in the terms and conditions of said preferred shares, and subject to OSFI's consent and approval.\n\nGiven that the LRCN - Series 1 and LRCN - Series 2 satisfy the non-viability contingent capital requirements, they qualify for the purposes of calculating regulatory capital under Basel III.\n\n## R Reeddeemmppttiioonnss  ooff  PPrreeffeerrrreedd  SShhaarreess\n\nOn August 16, 2021, i.e., the first business day after the August 15, 2021 redemption date, the Bank redeemed all the issued and outstanding Non-Cumulative 5-Year Rate-Reset Series 36 First Preferred Shares.

This process is a key tool in establishing the Bank's capital strategy and is subject to quarterly reviews and periodic amendments.\n\n## C Caappiittaall  MMaannaaggeemmeenntt\n\nCapital ratios are obtained by dividing capital (as defined by OSFI's Capital Adequacy Requirements guideline) by risk-weighted assets and are expressed as percentages. Risk-weighted assets are calculated in accordance with the rules established by OSFI for on- and off-balance-sheet risks. Credit, market, and operational risks are factored into the risk-weighted assets calculation for regulatory purposes. The definition adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) distinguishes between three types of capital. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital consists of common shareholders' equity less goodwill, intangible assets, and other CET1 capital deductions. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital consists of eligible non-cumulative preferred shares, limited recourse capital notes, and other AT1 capital adjustments. The sum of CET1 and AT1 capital forms what is known as Tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital consists of the eligible portion of subordinated debt and certain allowances for credit losses. Total regulatory capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.\n\nThe Bank and all other major Canadian banks have to maintain minimum capital ratios established by OSFI: a CET1 capital ratio of at least 10.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 12.0%, and a Total capital ratio of at least 14.0%. All of these ratios are to include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% established by the BCBS and OSFI, a 1.0% surcharge applicable solely to D-SIBs, and a 2.5% domestic stability buffer. On June 17, 2021, OSFI raised the domestic stability buffer from 1.0% to 2.5% effective on October 31, 2021. The domestic stability buffer, which varies from 0% to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets, consists exclusively of CET1 capital. A D-SIB that fails to meet this buffer requirement is not subject to automatic constraints to reduce capital distributions but must provide a remediation plan to OSFI. The banks also have to meet the capital floor that sets the regulatory capital level according to the Basel II Standardized approach. If the capital requirement under Basel III is less than 70% of the capital requirement as calculated under Basel II, the difference is added to riskweighted assets. Lastly, OSFI is requiring Canadian banks to meet a Basel III leverage ratio of at least 3.0%. The leverage ratio is a measure independent of risk that is calculated by dividing the amount of Tier 1 capital by total exposure. Total exposure is defined as the sum of on-balance-sheet assets (including derivative exposures and securities financing transaction exposures) and off-balance-sheet items. The assets deducted from Tier 1 capital are also deducted from total exposure.\n\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank was in compliance with all of OSFI's regulatory capital requirements.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

These plans allow the Bank to tie a portion of the value of the compensation of participants to the future value of the Bank's common shares. A DSU is a right that has a value equal to the closing price of a common share of the Bank on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the day preceding the award. DSUs generally vest evenly over four years. Additional DSUs are credited to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to the dividends declared on Bank common shares and vest evenly over the same period as the reference DSUs. DSUs may be cashed only when participants retire or leave the Bank or, for directors, when their term ends. The DSU Plans contain provisions for retiring employees whereby participants may continue vesting units in accordance with the stated terms of the award agreement.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, the Bank awarded 55,545 DSUs at a weighted average price of $75.55 (44,292 DSUs at a weighted average price of $67.35 for the year ended October 31, 2020). A total of 514,841 DSUs were outstanding as at October 31, 2021 (483,009 DSUs as at October 31, 2020).

The purpose of this plan is to foster the retention of key employees and promote the growth in income and the continuous improvement in profitability at the Wealth Management segment. Under this plan, participants can defer a portion of their annual compensation, and the Bank may pay a contribution to key employees when certain financial objectives are met. Amounts awarded by the Bank and the compensation deferred by participants are invested in, among other items, Bank common share units. These share units represent a right, the value of which corresponds to the closing price of the Bank's common share on the Toronto Stock Exchange on the award date. Additional units are paid to the accounts of participants in an amount equal to the dividends declared on the Bank's common shares. Share units representing the amounts awarded by the Bank vest evenly over four years. When a participant retires, or in certain cases when the participant's employment ceases, the participant receives a cash amount representing the value of the vested share units.\n\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2021, the Bank awarded 124,981 share units at a weighted average price of $80.23 (137,465 share units at a weighted average price of $69.80 for the year ended October 31, 2020). As at October 31, 2021, a total of 2,038,003 share units were outstanding (1,904,866 share units as at October 31, 2020).

The pension plans provide benefits based on years of plan participation and average earnings at retirement. Other post-employment benefit plans include post-employment medical, dental, and life insurance coverage. While pension plans are funded, the other plans are not. The fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations are measured as at October 31.\n\nThe Bank's most significant pension plan is the Employee Pension Plan of the National Bank of Canada; it is registered with OSFI and the Canada Revenue Agency and subject to the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 and the Income Tax Act.\n\nThe defined benefit plans expose the Bank to specific risks such as investment performance, changes to the discount rate used to calculate the obligation, the longevity of plan members and future inflation. While management believes that the assumptions used in the actuarial valuation process are reasonable, there remains a degree of risk and uncertainty that may cause future results to differ significantly from these assumptions, which could give rise to gains or losses.\n\nAccording to the Bank's governance rules, the policies and risk management related to the defined benefit plans are overseen at different levels by the pension committees, the Bank's management, and the Board's Human Resources Committee. The defined benefit plans are examined on an ongoing basis in order to monitor the funding and investment policies, the  financial status of the plans, and the Bank's funding requirements.\n\nThe Bank's funding policy for the defined benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions required by pension regulators.\n\nFor funded plans, the Bank determines whether an economic benefit exists in the form of potential reductions in future contributions and in the form of refunds from the plan surplus, where permitted by applicable regulations and plan provisions.\n\n## D Deeffiinneedd  BBeenneeffiitt  OObblliiggaattiioonn,,  PPllaann  AAsssseettss  aanndd  FFuunnddeedd  SSttaattuuss\n\n## As at October 31\n\n|                                                                                   |             | Pension plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                   | 2 2002211   | 2020            | 2 2002211                             | 2020                                  |\n| D Deeffiinneedd  bbeenneeffiitt  oobblliiggaattiioonn                             |             |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Balance at beginning                                                              | 5 5,,002277 | 4,703           | 1 15566                               | 157                                   |\n| Current service cost                                                              | 1 14466     | 126             | 1 1                                   | 2                                     |\n| Interest cost                                                                     | 1 14499     | 148             | 4 4                                   | 5                                     |\n| Remeasurements                                                                    |             |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Actuarial (gains) losses arising from changes in demographic assumptions          | 9 9         | 5               | 1 1                                   | 1                                     |\n| Actuarial (gains) losses arising from changes in financial assumptions            | ( (553388)) | 195             | ( (1144))                             | 1                                     |\n| Actuarial (gains) losses arising from experience adjustments                      | 1 10077     | -

For each plan, an allocation range per asset class is defined using a mix of equity and debt securities to optimize the risk-return profile of plan assets and minimize asset/liability mismatching.\n\nThe pension plan assets may include investment securities issued by the Bank. As at October 31, 2021 and 2020, the pension plan assets do not include any securities issued by the Bank.\n\nFor fiscal 2021, the Bank and its related entities received $15 million ($11 million in fiscal 2020) in fees from the pension plans for related management, administration and custodial services.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

Short-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data from corporate AA bonds. Long-term maturities are obtained using a curve based on observed data and extrapolated data.\n\nTo measure the pension plan and other post-employment plan obligation, the vested benefits that the Bank expects to pay in each future period are discounted to the measurement date using the spot rate associated with each of the respective periods based on the yield curve derived using the above methodology. The sum of discounted benefit amounts represents the defined benefit obligation. An average discount rate that replicates this obligation is then computed.\n\nTo better reflect current service cost, a separate discount rate was determined to account for the timing of future benefit payments associated with the additional year of service to be earned by the plan's active participants. Since these benefits are, on average, being paid at a later date than the benefits already earned by participants as a whole (i.e., longer duration), this method results in the use of a generally higher discount rate for calculating current service cost than that used to measure obligations where the yield curve is positively sloped. The methodology used to determine this discount rate is the same as the one used to establish the discount rate for measuring the obligation.\n\n## Other Assumptions\n\nFor measurement purposes, the estimated annual growth rate for health care costs was 4.52% as at October 31, 2021 (4.64% as at October 31, 2020). Based on the assumption retained, this rate is expected to decrease gradually to 3.28% in 2041 and remain steady thereafter.\n\nMortality assumptions are a determining factor when measuring the defined benefit obligation. Determining the expected benefit payout period is based on best estimate assumptions regarding mortality. Mortality tables are reviewed at least once a year, and the assumptions made are in accordance with accepted actuarial practice. New results regarding the plans are reviewed and used in calculating best estimates of future mortality.\n\n## As at October 31\n\n|                                                                  |                 | Pension plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   | Other post-employment benefit plans   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                  | 2 2002211       | 2020            | 2 2002211                             | 2020                                  |\n| D Deeffiinneedd  bbeenneeffiitt  oobblliiggaattiioonn            |                 |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Discount rate                                                    | 3 3..5555   % % | 2.90  %         | 3 3..5555   % %                       | 2.90  %                               |\n| Rate of compensation increase                                    | 3 3..0000   % % | 3.00  %         | 3 3..0000   % %                       | 3.00  %                               |\n| Health care cost trend rate                                      |                 |                 | 4 4..5522   % %                       | 4.64  %                               |\n| Life expectancy (in years)  at 65 for a participant currently at |                 |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Age 65                                                           |                 |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Men                                                              | 2 211..44       | 21.3            | 2 211..44                             | 21.3                                  |\n| Women                                                            | 2 233..77       | 23.7            | 2 233..77                             | 23.7                                  |\n| Age 45                                                           |                 |                 |                                       |                                       |\n| Men                                                              | 2 222..44       | 22.4            | 2 222..44                             | 22.4                                  |\n| Women                                                            | 2 244..77       | 24.6            | 2 244..77                             | 24.6                                  |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The recent developments in the main legal proceedings involving the Bank are as follows:\n\n## Watson\n\nIn 2011, a class action was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa Corporation Canada (Visa) and Mastercard International Incorporated (Mastercard) (the Networks) as well as National Bank and a number of other Canadian financial institutions. A similar action was also initiated in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan. In each of the actions, the Networks and financial institutions are alleged to have been involved in a price-fixing system to maintain and increase the fees paid by merchants on transactions executed using the credit cards of the Networks. In so doing, they would notably be in breach of the Competition Act. An unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages is being claimed. In 2017, a settlement was reached with the plaintiffs; in 2018 it was approved by the trial courts in each of the five jurisdictions where the action was initiated. The rulings approving the settlement were the subject of appeal proceedings in all jurisdictions. These appeal proceedings were all rejected during the year ended October 31, 2021, thereby confirming approval of the settlement reached in 2017 and ending the Bank's involvement in the class action.\n\n## Defrance\n\nOn January 21, 2019, the Quebec Superior Court authorized a class action against the National Bank and several other Canadian financial institutions. The originating application was served to the Bank on April 23, 2019. The class action was initiated on behalf of consumers residing in Quebec. The plaintiffs allege that non-sufficient funds charges, billed by all of the defendants when a payment order is refused due to non-sufficient funds, are illegal and prohibited by the Consumer Protection Act. The plaintiffs are claiming, in the form of damages, the repayment of these charges as well as punitive damages.\n\nIt is impossible to determine the outcome of the claims instituted or which may be instituted against the Bank and its subsidiaries. The Bank estimates, based on the information at its disposal, that while the amount of contingent liabilities pertaining to these claims, taken individually or in the aggregate, could have a material  impact  on  the  Bank's  consolidated  results  of  operations  for  a  particular  period,  it  would  not  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Bank's consolidated financial position.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank's maximum exposure to loss resulting from its interests in these structured entities consists primarily of the investments  in  these  entities,  the  fair  value  of  derivative  financial  instrument  contracts  entered  into  with  them,  and  the  backstop  liquidity  and  credit enhancement facilities granted to certain structured entities.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank may enter into financing transactions with third-party structured entities, including commercial loans, reverse repurchase agreements, prime brokerage margin lending, and similar collateralized lending transactions. While such transactions expose the Bank to the counterparty credit risk of the structured entities, this exposure is mitigated by the collateral related to these transactions. The Bank typically has neither power  nor  significant  variable  returns  resulting  from  financing  transactions  with  structured  entities  and  does  not  consolidate  such  entities.  Financing transactions with third-party-sponsored structured entities are included in the Bank's consolidated financial statements and are not included in the table accompanying this note on page 218.\n\n## N Noonn--CCoonnssoolliiddaatteedd  SSttrruuccttuurreedd  EEnnttiittiieess\n\n## Multi-Seller Conduits\n\nThe Bank administers multi-seller conduits that purchase financial assets from clients and finance those purchases by issuing commercial paper backed by the assets acquired. Clients use these multi-seller conduits to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. Notes issued by the conduits and held by third parties provide additional credit loss protection. The Bank acts as a financial agent and provides these conduits with administrative and transaction structuring services as well as backstop liquidity and credit enhancement facilities under the commercial paper program. These facilities are presented and described in Note 26. The Bank has concluded derivative financial instrument contracts with these conduits, the fair value of which is presented on the Bank's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Although the Bank has the ability to direct the relevant activities of these conduits, it cannot use its power to affect the amount of the returns it obtains, as it acts as an agent. Consequently, the Bank does not control these conduits and does not consolidate them.\n\n## Investment Funds\n\nThe Bank enters into derivative or other financial instrument contracts with third parties to provide them with the desired exposure to certain investment funds. The Bank economically hedges the risks related to these derivatives by investing in those investment funds. The Bank can also hold economic interests in certain investment funds as part of its investing activities. In addition, the Bank is sponsor and investment manager of mutual funds in which it has insignificant or no interest. The Bank does not control the funds where its holdings are not significant given that, in these circumstances, the Bank either acts only as an agent or does not have any power over the relevant activities. In both cases, it does not have significant exposure to the variable returns of the funds.  Therefore, the Bank does not consolidate these funds.\n\n## Private Investments\n\nAs part of its investment banking operations, the Bank invests in several limited liability partnerships and other incorporated entities. These investment companies in turn invest in operating companies with a view to reselling these investments at a profit over the medium or long term. The Bank does not intervene in the operations of these entities; its only role is that of an investor. Consequently, it does not control these companies and does not consolidate them.\n\n## Third-Party Structured Entities\n\nThe Bank has invested in third-party structured entities, some of which are asset-backed. The underlying assets consist of residential mortgages, consumer loans, equipment loans, leases, and securities. The Bank does not have the ability to direct the relevant activities of these structured entities and has no exposure to their variable returns, other than the right to receive interest income and dividend income from its investments. Consequently, the Bank does not control these structured entities and does not consolidate them.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The excess spread represents the residual net interest income after all the expenses related to this structure have been paid. The Bank also provides second-loss protection as it holds subordinated notes issued by CCCT II. In addition, the Bank acts as an administrative agent and servicer and as such is responsible for the daily administration and management of CCCT II's credit card receivables. The Bank therefore has the ability to direct the relevant activities of CCCT II and can exercise its power to affect the amount of returns it obtains. Consequently, the Bank controls CCCT II and consolidates it.\n\n## Multi-Seller Conduit\n\nThe Bank administers a multi-seller conduit that purchases various financial assets from clients and finances those purchases by issuing debt securities (including commercial paper) backed by the assets acquired. The clients use this multi-seller conduit to diversify their funding sources and reduce borrowing costs, while continuing to manage the financial assets and providing some amount of first-loss protection. The Bank holds the sole note issued by the conduit and has concluded a derivative financial instrument contract with the conduit. The Bank controls the relevant activities of this conduit through its involvement as a financial agent, agent for administrative and transaction structuring services as well as investor in the conduit's sole note. The Bank's functions and investment in the conduit confer to it decision-making power over the composition of assets acquired by the conduit and the selection of the seller as well as some exposure to the conduit's variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates this conduit.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The Bank controls the relevant activities of certain funds through its involvement as an investor and its significant exposure to their variable returns. Therefore, the Bank consolidates these funds.\n\n## Covered Bonds\n\n## NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership\n\nIn December 2013, the Bank established the covered bond legislative program under which covered bonds are issued. It therefore created NBC Covered Bond Guarantor (Legislative) Limited Partnership (the Guarantor) to guarantee payment of the principal and interest owed to the bondholders. The Bank sold uninsured residential mortgages to the Guarantor and granted it loans to facilitate the acquisition of these assets. The Bank acts as manager of the partnership and has decision-making authority over its relevant activities in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program. In addition, the Bank is able, in accordance with the contractual terms governing the covered bond legislative program, to affect the variable returns of the partnership, which are directly related to the return on the mortgage loan portfolio and the interest on the loans from the Bank. Consequently, the Bank controls the partnership and consolidates it.\n\n## Third-Party Structured Entities\n\nIn 2018, the Bank, through one of its subsidiaries, provided financing to a third-party structured entity in exchange for a 100% interest in a loan portfolio, the sole asset held by that entity. The Bank controls and therefore consolidates the structured entity, as it has the ability to direct the entity's relevant activities through its involvement in the decision-making process. The Bank is also exposed to the entity's variable returns.\n\nThe following table presents the Bank's investments and other assets in the consolidated structured entities as well as the total assets of these entities.\n\n| As at October 31                                                      |                                                             | 2 2002211                       | 2020                          | 2020              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                       | I Innvveessttmmeennttss   a anndd  ootthheerr  aasssseettss | T Toottaall   a asssseettss (1) | Investments  and other assets | Total  assets (1) |\n| C Coonnssoolliiddaatteedd  ssttrruuccttuurreedd  eennttiittiieess     |                                                             |                                 |                               |                   |\n| Securitization entity for the Bank ' s credit card receivables (2)(3) | 2 2,,441100                                                 | 2 2,,554444                     | 1,417                         | 1,478             |\n| Multiseller conduit (4)                                               | 2 25566                                                     | 2 25566                         | 172                           | 172               |\n| Investment funds (5)                                                  | 1 12211                                                     | 1 12211                         | 174                           | 174               |\n| Covered bonds (6)                                                     | 1 155,,666633                                               | 1 166,,004488                   | 16,771                        | 17,197            |\n| Third-party structured entities (7)                                   | 1 16699                                                     | 1 16699                         | 191                           | 191               |\n|                                                                       | 1 188,,661199                                               | 1 199,,113388                   | 18,725                        | 19,212            |\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

The information gathered from this maturity analysis is a component of liquidity and funding management. However, this maturity profile does not represent how the Bank manages its interest rate risk nor its liquidity risk and funding needs. The Bank considers factors other than contractual maturity when assessing liquid assets or determining expected future cash flows.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Bank enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. The credit instruments used to meet the funding needs of its clients represent the maximum amount of additional credit the Bank could be obligated to extend if the commitments were fully drawn.\n\nThe Bank also has future minimum commitments under leases for premises as well as under other contracts, mainly commitments to purchase loans and contracts for outsourced information technology services. Most of the lease commitments are related to operating leases.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",

(Flinks), a leading fintech company specialized in financial data aggregation and distribution, in which the Bank had already been holding a 30.2% equity interest. Flinks provides services to a wide North American fintech ecosystem and offers  attractive  data  technology  solutions.  The  acquisition  strategically  positions  the  Bank  in  a  high-growth  market  to  continue  to  enhance  customer experiences and benefit from future technology-driven innovations. At the time of acquisition, the amount of which was $73 million in cash for voting preferred shares, the Bank was holding an 82.9% equity interest in Flinks, thereby giving it control thereover. Immediately after the acquisition, the Bank made an additional $30 million investment in voting preferred shares, giving the Bank an 85.9% equity interest in Flinks. The amount of the $73 million purchase price, of the fair value of the previously held equity interest, and of the estimated value of the non-controlling interest established on the acquisition date, exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by $101 million. This excess amount has been recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as goodwill and mainly represents the expected future profits of Flinks given its favourable position in this growth market. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The previously held equity interest, accounted for as an associate, was remeasured at fair value, generating a $33 million non-taxable remeasurement gain that was reported in the Non-interest income - Other item of the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n\nFor the year ended October 31, 2021, the acquisition-related costs included in the Non-interest expenses item of the Consolidated Statement of Income were negligible. With respect to the presentation of financial results according to business segment, the gain on remeasurement of the previously held equity interest as well as the financial results of Flinks are being reported in the Other heading of segment results. The financial results of Flinks have been consolidated  into  the  Bank's  financial  statements  since  September 8, 2021.  During  the  year  ended  October 31, 2021,  Flinks  contributed  approximately $1 million to the Bank's total revenues and a net loss of approximately $3 million to the Bank's total net income. If the Bank had finalized the acquisition on November 1, 2020, the Bank would have reported total revenues of approximately $8,936 million and net income of approximately $3,170 million for the year ended October 31, 2021.\n\nNational Bank of Canada",
