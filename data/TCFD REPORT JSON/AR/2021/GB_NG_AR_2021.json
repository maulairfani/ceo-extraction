As nations now focus on energy security and affordability, as well as decarbonisation, we embrace our role in delivering the energy system of the/uni00A0future.'\n\nThe events of the past year - indeed, the past months - have tested the resolve, culture and resilience of all businesses. As I write this first letter to you in my role as Chair, Ukraine is engulfed in a brutal confrontation with Russia. At/uni00A0National Grid, we supported and adjusted quickly to the Russian sanctions put in place by/uni00A0the UK government. We have also been engaging with the UK government on assuring long-term security of energy supply, including through accelerating the roll-out of renewables. In/uni00A0the US, we continue to work on an agenda of decarbonisation, ranging from new high-voltage electric transmission infrastructure for delivery of low- or zero-carbon resources to operating one of that nation's first hydrogen blending projects. In both countries, we undertake our efforts against the backdrop of elevated energy prices/uni00A0for our customers and heightened concerns about balancing the costs of system/uni00A0enhancements with the affordability of/uni00A0these/uni00A0improvements.\n\nIt is a privilege to be the first American to serve as the Chair of National Grid, an iconic industrial company. National Grid has a proud and longstanding heritage, but it is also a/uni00A0business that has long been focused firmly on the future. We didn't start the process of being a/uni00A0state-ofthe-art energy system yesterday. For more than/uni00A0two decades we have been working to decarbonise energy. We have been iterating and/uni00A0experimenting with our fulfilment capabilities - with the digital grid, with hydrogen, with multipurpose interconnectors. And we will keep iterating and collaborating until we achieve the necessary levels of performance to assure you that clean energy delivery will be utterly reliable and affordable as well.\n\nAt National Grid, we are witnessing the increasing intensity of impatience in society in/uni00A0its/uni00A0pursuit to see changes in the contours of our energy system. We are working on multiple fronts to deliver infrastructure and service more quickly and more cleanly than ever before, including: digitalisation of business systems and operations to ensure service reliability and rapid response time; increased cyber security barriers to protect our critical national infrastructure; and use of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to/uni00A0optimise our operations. And/uni00A0we are focused on the best possible delivery on/uni00A0the front lines. Perhaps you have noticed that storms are more frequent and severe. Meanwhile, society is dependent on rapid restoration of service. We live in a connected world and none of us easily tolerates a power outage. My National Grid colleagues are/uni00A0thus working in increasingly harsh weather conditions to reconnect customers in ever shorter response times. This is complicated by/uni00A0the fact that we are managing the increased complexity of the grid itself, as renewables become a larger part of the generation mix in/uni00A0both countries.\n\nThese are among the issues of today and tomorrow. As Chair, my role is to ensure our/uni00A0governance both challenges and supports decision making that will ultimately lead to a/uni00A0decarbonised and digital future. Our business reorganisation, the refresh of the Board and the thoughtful adjustment of our investment mix are/uni00A0intended to meet these challenges.",

        "page_content": "## A Board for the future\n\nAs you will note, several distinguished Board members have reached the ends of their terms. Sir Peter Gershon, Dr Paul Golby, Mark Williamson, and Jonathan Dawson have all served nine-year terms. In addition, Amanda Mesler, who has been a member of our Board for the last four years, has decided not to stand for re-election as her career in technology takes her/uni00A0in some different directions. On behalf of my/uni00A0Board colleagues, I express my appreciation to/uni00A0all of them.\n\nNevertheless, from this loss comes opportunity. We are fortunate to have recruited five new Directors who bring fresh perspectives and experience to the Board Ian Livingston, Tony/uni00A0Wood, Martha Wyrsch, Anne Robinson and/uni00A0Iain MacKay, bring strategic thoughtfulness, engagement, constructive challenge, independence and gravitas to tackling the issues we face.\n\n## Operating with purpose\n\nMoments of societal reckoning over recent times have further cemented my belief that National Grid must respond as a responsible business. It/uni00A0is clear: we are here to serve. Our sense of the/uni00A0larger purpose we play in society helps us keep/uni00A0doing the right thing at the heart of our decision making. As I have travelled around the National Grid system in both countries, I/uni00A0am heartened by the ethos of our people. I have also seen this ethos of community engagement first-hand in the work that is done by Grid for/uni00A0Good, Project C and our Grid Employability programmes, to name but a few examples. Our/uni00A0RBR, which you can find at nationalgrid. com/responsibility , provides an/uni00A0update on our excellent progress to date on key commitments.\n\nAlong with purpose comes partnership. Working/uni00A0with regulators, customers, communities, stakeholders and business partners is key to our/uni00A0long-term health as a/uni00A0company. I have appreciated the candour of those of you with whom I have met in the past year. This input unvarnished and honest exchanges - helps guide the Board deliberations.\n\nSolutions to the challenges of our time must be rooted in an overarching sense that we are in this together, working for the collective good. Geopolitical upheaval only deepens the sense within society that we must embrace change urgently. Across the UK and US, we are working with governments and communities to determine the best way forward for the delivery of net zero. In recognising that National Grid must change,\n\nI/uni00A0see that governments, regulators and stakeholders are grappling with how to drive progress as well. I would offer the observation that we all need to break old habits and get on/uni00A0with the business of change.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nIn the previous fiscal year, we set a strategic course to pivot to a greater focus on electricity as the energy mix of the future. With the acquisition of WPD and the announced sale of/uni00A0a/uni00A0majority stake of our UK natural gas transmission business, our portfolio is changing. The Board will continue to assess the businesses we will participate and grow in as the/uni00A0energy landscape evolves. For example, we/uni00A0welcome the UK government moving forward with the development of a Future System Operator (FSO). This initiative is expected to see/uni00A0us divest our ESO in the future. Similarly, our/uni00A0investments in the various interconnectors which/uni00A0link the UK to/uni00A0continental Europe and our/uni00A0partnership with RWE in the New York Bight auction for offshore wind, are examples of investments where we are leaning into the future/uni00A0energy system.\n\nAs you will note in the Notice of Meeting which/uni00A0accompanies this Annual Report, our climate/uni00A0transition plan is being put to a vote by/uni00A0shareholders at our 2022 AGM. I hope you will/uni00A0find that this plan provides tangible evidence of National Grid's resolve to move to net zero, including metrics that facilitate tracking of our progress. We ask for your support of our Climate Transition Plan, your Board of Directors, and various other business matters on which you are/uni00A0asked to vote.\n\nIn closing, I would like to recognise our National Grid colleagues with this oft-repeated phrase: if/uni00A0it were easy, everyone would be doing it. The/uni00A0Board recognises your singular efforts, your dedication and your tenacity. Your enthusiasm for delivering net zero and a fair energy transition is, I believe, unparalleled. Thank you for living our values and for Doing Right Now.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaula Rosput Reynolds Chair\n\nFinal dividend of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nper share proposed to be paid on 17 August 2022\n\n## Full-year dividend (pence per share)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) of/uni00A0National Grid plc will be held as a hybrid event at 10.00am on Monday 11 July 2022.

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Context in which we are operating\n\nOver the last 12 months, as the world took tentative steps out of the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, it also witnessed unprecedented climate events, an increasingly divided geopolitical landscape, and - in the UK/uni00A0and US - rising costs of living. As I write, we/uni00A0continue to witness terrible events in Ukraine. The combined turmoil and change of the past year means that all three points of the energy trilemma (security, affordability and sustainability) are now in sharp focus as one.\n\nIn a rapidly changing world, it is more important than ever that our vision is clear and our journey to achieve it is well executed. National Grid will be at the heart of a clean, fair and affordable energy future.\n\nThere is no doubt that rising gas prices and a/uni00A0higher cost of energy in the UK and US have highlighted the challenge of affordability. Our political stakeholders in all jurisdictions are also grappling with this challenge, and we continue to/uni00A0take a partnership approach with both\n\n' We will enhance our/uni00A0role in the energy/uni00A0transition and drive long-term shareholder value.'\n\ngovernments and regulators to deliver an energy transition that leaves nobody behind. Whilst we/uni00A0do not have control over energy prices, we/uni00A0are playing our part by innovating at speed on projects and making significant capital investment to bring cheaper, greener energy to/uni00A0our customers.\n\nI was particularly pleased to see clean energy sitting at the heart of the British Energy Security strategy - net zero is a clear route to a reduction in consumer bills over the long term, increased energy independence and lower carbon emissions. As a sector, we must now work at pace to deliver the ambitious targets set and remain conscious, too, of other opportunities to/uni00A0reach our collective goals, such as increased energy efficiency.\n\nIn the UK, we have been working closely with government, industry and the regulator to create the FSO that/uni00A0enables long-term holistic thinking, drives progress towards net zero, and lays the foundations for the regulatory reform necessary to/uni00A0deliver the energy system of the future. As/uni00A0announced in April 2022, the ESO is expected to/uni00A0transfer out/uni00A0of National Grid to become part of/uni00A0the newly created FSO by 2024. We will continue to work closely with all relevant parties to/uni00A0ensure a/uni00A0smooth transition, subject to parliamentary approval and conclusion of the transaction process.\n\nIn a fast-moving world, we must remember that the challenge of reaching net zero cannot be underestimated, and significant policy and regulatory change will be needed to get there. We are committed to working together with all our stakeholders to create the right policy and regulatory frameworks to deliver the investment needed at the lowest long-term cost to consumers in all our markets.\n\n## Business highlights\n\nDelivering for our customers remains my key focus and I am very clear that this must underpin all that we do. A clear example is our vision for a/uni00A0fossilfree future in the US, launched in April 2022, which places consumer choice and affordability at the heart of fighting climate change.\n\nThis vision to fully eliminate fossil fuels from our US gas networks, replacing it with renewable natural gas and green hydrogen, will enable the customers and communities we serve to meet their heating needs without using fossil fuels by 2050, if not sooner. Combined with targeted electrification and enhanced energy efficiency, a/uni00A0100% fossil-free gas network can deliver a/uni00A0clean energy future that is more affordable and/uni00A0more reliable to more than 20 million people across New York and Massachusetts.",

        "page_content": "We have made significant progress throughout the year towards a clean energy future in the US. In/uni00A0December, we launched a joint project with the town of Hempstead to build one of the first and largest clean hydrogen projects in the US. The HyGrid project, on Long Island, will blend green hydrogen into the existing distribution system to heat approximately 800 homes and fuel 10 municipal vehicles.\n\nA key highlight of the year for me was National Grid's role as a Principal Partner of COP26. This enabled us to drive action on the fight against climate change more directly than ever before. From meeting with world leaders, to hosting the launch of the global Green Grids Initiative, and sharing our work to enable clean transport, it/uni00A0was a unique opportunity to discuss our learnings with delegations from across the globe and collaborate on how best we can work together to accelerate action.\n\nIt is important we match talking with doing. Since COP26, we have had new Science Based Targets approved; with both our UK ET and ED/uni00A0businesses and the ESO limiting their greenhouse gas emissions to a 1.5\u00baC warming scenario. And against a 1990 baseline, I can now report our carbon emissions are down by 65% across the Group.\n\nThe year also saw us deliver on the strategic transactions we announced 12 months ago. The/uni00A0transactions represented a strategic pivot for National Grid and underlined our belief that the journey to net zero will see increased electrification across the UK and US. The Group expects the NECO Sale to complete by the end of Q1 2022/23.\n\nThe year saw us make good progress on regulatory matters. In the first half, the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) upheld part of our appeal on RIIO-T2, which saw the removal of the outperformance wedge. In the US, new rate agreements for KEDNY-KEDLI, Massachusetts Gas and Niagara Mohawk were/uni00A0agreed during the year, giving us longterm/uni00A0visibility.\n\nOur National Grid Ventures business continues to deliver clean, green energy through its interconnectors. We completed our fifth interconnector, North Sea Link (NSL), which connects the UK with Norway and is the world's longest subsea interconnector. NSL, which is a/uni00A0joint venture with Norwegian system operator Statnett, can provide enough clean electricity to/uni00A0power 1.4 million homes.\n\nThe fire at our IFA interconnector saw a/uni00A050%/uni00A0reduction in its capacity. However, I/uni00A0am/uni00A0pleased/uni00A0that our/uni00A0team's fast response and/uni00A0focus/uni00A0on recovery means we now expect the IFA/uni00A0interconnector to/uni00A0return to full service in/uni00A0December 2022, significantly earlier than/uni00A0planned.\n\nWPD, our electricity distribution business, which/uni00A0will shortly be rebranding under the National Grid name, has submitted a highly ambitious business plan for 2023 - 2028 outlining \u00a36.7 billion of investment to drive the pathway to/uni00A0net zero for our customers in the Midlands, South Wales and the South West. This/uni00A0will act as/uni00A0an additional \u00a31.4 billion of investment from present-day levels, whilst maintaining affordability for our customers.\n\nWe have reported good operational performance in a year of significant strategic change. We have reported a strong set of results. In May, Ofgem agreed to our request to pay \u00a3200 million of interconnector profits back ahead of the planned timeframe, as/uni00A0we took action to lower bills for/uni00A0consumers.\n\nWe are investing around \u00a324 billion over the next/uni00A0five years directly into decarbonising energy networks, starting now. This is measured in accordance with the EU/uni00A0taxonomy, and excludes 'clean' spend in/uni00A0areas such as connecting nuclear power and lowering methane emissions through gas pipeline replacement. In/uni00A0every sense, this investment cements our position as/uni00A0The Energy Transition Company.\n\n## Doing Right Now\n\nNational Grid is a responsible business, because it is the right thing to do. Our RBR, which is published alongside the Annual Report, details our progress to date on the commitments we/uni00A0set/uni00A0out in our RBC.\n\nCommunities sit at the heart of our RBC, and I/uni00A0am/uni00A0delighted that our Grid for Good initiative has positively impacted the lives of thousands of/uni00A0young people to date, with participation from hundreds of National Grid volunteers. Grid for Good was created to drive lasting and positive change for disadvantaged young people and we/uni00A0are well on the way to achieving our goal of/uni00A0125,000 volunteering hours by 2030.\n\nDiversity is critical to business success and I/uni00A0am/uni00A0pleased to report this year that we have no/uni00A0material gender pay gap in the UK business. Of/uni00A0course, this is just one measure, and we recognise that there is more work to do to bring greater diversity to all levels at National Grid.\n\nKey highlights in 2021/22\n\n<!-- image -->",

I/uni00A0am very clear that we can achieve more with a/uni00A0diverse organisation, and it is vital that we/uni00A0represent the communities we serve.\n\nOver the last year, I am pleased to say we have continued to deliver energy reliably, safely and efficiently for our customers in all jurisdictions, and continue to focus on our safety performance.\n\nOf course, it would not be possible to deliver these results without the hard work of the teams across the business. I would like to take this opportunity to say a sincere and heartfelt thank you to all National Grid colleagues, who, despite living through the most extraordinary and challenging of times, continue to serve the Company with hard work, dedication and outstanding skill.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we look ahead, we do so with optimism. National Grid is uniquely positioned as The Energy Transition Company, at a time when climate goals, customer demands and geopolitics align on the imperative need to/uni00A0fully/uni00A0decarbonise our economies.\n\nIn the UK, we will support the government in delivering its British Energy Security Strategy and/uni00A0the ambitious target of delivering 50 GW of/uni00A0offshore wind by 2030, including up to 5 GW floating wind, by developing and delivering transmission project proposals in alignment with/uni00A0the national blueprint. We will work with government and regulators to reform the consenting and regulatory frameworks to deliver the unprecedented levels of new transmission capacity required to deliver the strategy much faster than under the current arrangements. We will complete the integration of WPD into our new Electricity Distribution business and seek a/uni00A0successful outcome in our RIIO-ED2 regulatory process that gives us the flexibility to invest in our distribution networks to support the Strategy and the expected growth in heat pumps, electric vehicles and solar generation.\n\nIn the US, we will continue the work started to make fossil-free gas a reality on our networks by supporting legislative and regulatory policies to grow fossil-free gas, developing voluntary tariffs for customer participation in fossil-free gas offerings and running neighbourhood pilots for green H 2 network blending, networked geothermal, and targeted electrification of/uni00A0heating.\n\nNational Grid has a key strategic role to play in/uni00A0delivering the legacy of COP26 and we will become even more vocal on this over the next 12 months. We are working side by side with the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Q&A\n\n## How can we solve the huge challenge of/uni00A0achieving net zero?\n\nPartnership and collaboration hold the key to/uni00A0unlocking some of the biggest global challenges we face. Communities, government, regulators and industry all have a/uni00A0critical role to/uni00A0play in reaching net zero and it is only by working together and challenging each other to/uni00A0be bolder, more innovative, and to deliver at pace that we will achieve this. For the industry, delivering the energy system of the future, while operating and safeguarding the energy system of today, will require a huge shift in mindset. We must rise to/uni00A0this challenge and embrace the opportunity we have to create a/uni00A0fair and affordable future for all.\n\n## Why did National Grid feel it was important to be a principal partner of COP26?\n\nClimate change is the biggest challenge we will face as a society - and there is a ticking clock. National Grid is uniquely positioned to lead the energy transition across the UK and Northeast US, but COP26 gave us the opportunity to go further and to collaborate and learn from partners on a global scale.\n\n## Why should I invest in National Grid?\n\nThe fundamentals of our business are strong; they underpin long-term value creation. We are at/uni00A0the forefront of the green revolution. There is huge business opportunity and we are fully\n\nUK, India and US governments on the Green Grids Initiative to accelerate the decarbonisation of electricity grids globally; we are engaged in the Glasgow Breakthroughs to share learning and drive progress in different sectors; and we will share our views on progress and policy needed globally. We must now move fast to seize the opportunity this decade to keep 1.5\u00b0C/uni00A0in sight.\n\nWe are leading a clean, fair and affordable energy transition across the jurisdictions we serve, and we do so with pride. No one will be left behind. Our pace will accelerate, our efforts will increase, and our action will be bold. The business is positioned for long-term success.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naligned with government and societal demands to deliver greener, cleaner energy. We are Doing Right Now.\n\n## Can you share an update on the/uni00A0transactions?\n\nThe transactions that we announced in March 2021 and have implemented over the past 12 months represented a strategic pivot for the Company. The acquisition of WPD in the UK, the sale of Rhode Island in the US and an agreement to sell a/uni00A0majority stake in Gas Transmission in the UK, will leave our business split equally between the UK and the US, and with a focus that is 70% on electricity and 30% on gas. This is aligned with our view of the energy transition - gas will continue to have a/uni00A0key role to play, representing around 30% of/uni00A0the energy system by 2050 as we see increased electrification in the journey to net/uni00A0zero.\n\n## As CEO, what are you most proud/uni00A0of?\n\nMy colleagues. Living and working through a/uni00A0global pandemic has been challenging for everyone in different ways. I am very proud of/uni00A0the way everyone working at National Grid has carried out their duties with skill and professionalism in the most difficult and extraordinary circumstances to keep the/uni00A0lights/uni00A0on and the gas flowing for our/uni00A0customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScan here to view our video",

National Energy Action has anticipated that the number of households in fuel poverty will rise from 4.5 million to around 6 million because of the increased cap.\n\nAs a result, the Treasury announced that households will receive up to \u00a3350 of government support to help protect them from the rising energy costs. This includes a/uni00A0\u00a3200 discount on electricity bills for all consumers from October 2022, and a \u00a3150 council tax rebate from April for 80% of council taxpayers in England based on their tax/uni00A0bands.\n\n## US\n\nEconomy-wide inflation has been amplified in/uni00A0the energy sector. The energy price index rose 26% from February 2021 to February 2022, with all major energy component indexes increasing; natural gas and electricity rose 24% and 9%, respectively.\n\nCOVID-19 also brought serious economic hardship to many of our customers, elevating affordability concerns even further, and many moratoria on disconnection for non-payment have expired.\n\nIn response, Congress's American Rescue Plan included an additional $4.5 billion in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program funding, including $535 million for New York and $187 million for Massachusetts.\n\n- \u00b7  We donated \u00a31 million to support the relief effort in Ukraine, split equally between the British Red Cross, the United Nations refugee agency, and UNICEF.\n- \u00b7  We published our first Responsible Business Report in June 2021, providing an update on commitments in our Responsible Business Charter across five/uni00A0key areas: the environment, our communities, our people, the economy and our governance.\n- \u00b7  In the UK, our Grid for Good Programme is/uni00A0in/uni00A0its second year of having a/uni00A0positive impact on socio-economically disadvantaged young people during this economic downturn.

The/uni00A0targets we have set are consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to well below 2\u00b0C. We have also identified where we can accelerate our targets further.\n- \u00b7  We worked with the Electric Power Research Institute, the Gas Technology Institute and other utilities to sponsor the/uni00A0Low-Carbon Resources Initiative to/uni00A0accelerate the development and demonstration of low-carbon and zero-carbon energy technologies.\n- \u00b7  With 60% of all offshore wind developments in the UK planning to bring their energy onshore through the East Coast, we progressed projects such as the one in Yorkshire Green to increase capacity and relieve constraints on the network.\n\n- \u00b7  We worked with industry players to support decarbonisation projects in heavy industry in Humber and Teeside. The East Coast Cluster won a bid to be one of the UK's first two industrial carbon capture clusters, and it has the potential to transport and store 50% of all UK industry carbon emissions securely, up to/uni00A027 million tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by/uni00A02030.\n- \u00b7  We worked with Hitachi Energy in a pilot project at Richborough Substation in Kent to replace sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) gas with a/uni00A0greener alternative. This change forms part of our ambition to reduce SF6 emissions by 50% by 2030 and remove SF6 gas from our electricity assets by/uni00A02050.\n- \u00b7  WPD published an environment strategy in/uni00A0April 2021 that details commitments to/uni00A0ensure environmental responsibility underpins all its activities in RIIO-ED2 and beyond. It provides an overarching pathway to/uni00A0achieving net zero by 2028 (excluding network losses), ahead of the government's target date of 2050.\n- \u00b7  We announced our vision for a fossil-free future, fully eliminating fossil fuels from our US gas and electric systems, enabling the customers and communities we serve to meet their heating needs without using fossil fuels by 2050. Our plan is based on/uni00A0energy-efficient buildings, a 100% fossil-free gas network, hybrid electric-gas heating systems, and targeted electrification and networked geothermal.\n- \u00b7  We joined seven major US utilities in the Electric Highway Coalition, which will enable more electric-vehicle charging stations along highways across the US.\n- \u00b7  In June 2021, we commenced operations of/uni00A0two solar projects totalling 40 MW in/uni00A0Michigan. These employed over 150/uni00A0workers from communities within 100 miles of each site during construction.\n\nOnsite gas cart used to retro fill existing gas-insulated, high-voltage switchgear, with an alternative low global warming g 3 gas, designed for high-voltage transmission equipment, Richborough Substation, Kent, UK\n\n<!-- image -->",

The median power plant in Europe could reduce in size by up to 95% due to the scale of distributed generation.\n\nDecentralised electricity systems are increasingly made possible by developments in smart systems/uni00A0and flexibility solutions, and supported/uni00A0by local initiatives to develop decarbonisation/uni00A0pathways.\n\nThis increasingly decentralised network presents a paradigm shift for the ESO as we/uni00A0work to enable the transition away from a/uni00A0system developed for a small number of/uni00A0large generation plants. The ESO will continue to innovate to enable Great Britain's electricity system as it transitions to becoming a separate, independent public corporation known as the Future System/uni00A0Operator.\n\nThe six UK DNO groups submitted their RIIO-ED2 business plans in 2021, describing the role of decentralised electricity systems in achieving net zero, including the role of the distribution system operator in the future.\n\n## US\n\nThe US is seeing one of the highest levels of/uni00A0grid investment in the world to meet demand for more decentralised assets such/uni00A0as distributed generation and electric vehicle/uni00A0charging.\n\nIn Massachusetts, the Department of Energy Resources officially approved the doubling of/uni00A0the current solar programme to 3.2 GW. The Department of Public Utilities passed a/uni00A0provisional programme regarding cost allocation to support distributed generation. The state also allocated $13.1 million in grants to install 306 direct current fast charging electric vehicle charging ports at/uni00A0150 locations.\n\nNew York's Governor called for a doubling of/uni00A0the energy-storage target to 6 GW by 2030 and intends to establish a world-class battery research and manufacturing centre. Proposals also included a $1 billion investment to support electric vehicle (EV) adoption and charging; $500 million to develop offshore wind supply chains and port/uni00A0infrastructure; and the creation of a green hydrogen hub to compete for $10 billion federal funding.\n\n- \u00b7  In the UK, we are running three Network Option Assessment Pathfinder projects to/uni00A0pilot innovative ways to ensure grid reliability as we prepare to operate a/uni00A0zero-carbon grid by 2025.\n- \u00b7  We connected 406 smaller, distributed generation customers to the network in the/uni00A0UK, double the number we connected two years ago.\n- \u00b7  The Equitable Novel Flexibility Exchange (Equinox) project allows WPD customers with heat pumps in their homes to participate in a flexible energy future. This/uni00A0project will assist in the deferral or avoidance of network reinforcement due to/uni00A0the predicted high uptake of heat pumps in the upcoming RIIO-ED2 and/uni00A0beyond.\n- \u00b7  WPD published reports for each local authority as part of the Distribution Future Energy Scenarios process, outlining the expected uptake of different demand and generation technologies at a decentralised level. The reports are used to assist local stakeholders with local area energy planning and for WPD to identify areas of/uni00A0strategic investment in the distribution/uni00A0network.\n- \u00b7  We connected 207 MW of distributed energy resources in New York in 2021. This is the most distributed generation we/uni00A0have ever connected and earned us the maximum incentive payment.\n- \u00b7  Funding was approved for our Active Resource Integration pilot by New York's Public Service Commission.

It is a joint venture with the/uni00A0Norwegian system operator, Statnett, and cost \u20ac1.6 billion over six years to build. The 1,400 MW link stretches 447 miles (720 kilometres) between the UK and Norway under the North Sea, and can power approximately 1.4 million homes. Enabling the trade of renewable energy will help reduce the UK's carbon emissions by 23 million tonnes of carbon by 2030, save customers money, and bolster energy security.\n\n## WPD and ET response to/uni00A0Storm/uni00A0Arwen\n\nWinds of over 92 miles per hour (148 kilometres per hour) and heavy snow hit the UK in/uni00A0November 2021, impacting electricity distribution and transmission. All four of WPD's distribution networks were affected, requiring power restoration to over 243,000 properties, answering 98,745 customer calls, and resolving over 1,600 incidents. Our transmission network was also affected, with 45 network faults reported. Fortunately, our automatic protection mechanisms worked well to deal with the faults reported. Overall, well-versed preparation, action and communication resulted in a successful response in our service areas to the worst storm to affect power supplies in 15 years.\n\n## Offshore wind lease awarded in the New York Bight\n\nIn February 2022, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management hosted the country's largest offshore wind lease auction to date for seabed development rights between New York and New Jersey.

NGP's portfolio as at 31 March 2022 comprised 38 companies and four fund investments at a fair value of $491 million.\n\nDuring the past fiscal year, NGP invested in 13/uni00A0new startups - AptEdge, Baffle, Cogniac, Compute North, Cyolo, Finite State, Incorta, Pathr, Risilience, Sensat, Sync Computing, TS/uni00A0Conductor and Viridi Parente - whose technology can make power grids greener, more secure and more customer friendly. Existing portfolio company Dragos announced a $200 million funding round in which NGP participated as a returning investor. The Series D round is believed to be the largest ever for an operational technology (OT) cyber security company. NGP first invested in Dragos in 2018, when National Grid began using the company's industrial threat intelligence service to monitor global threats to industrial control/uni00A0systems.\n\nNGP continues to build use cases of its portfolio innovations across our core businesses.

It identifies and isolates the location of/uni00A0a/uni00A0fault to minimise impact to the grid and the number of customers affected, while enabling a speedier return to service for uninvolved customers when this is safely possible. Creating FLISR capabilities involves installing reclosers and feeder monitors at substations, with preprogrammed logic, to enable near real-time responses to/uni00A0faults.\n\nThe technology was installed as part of the Advanced Data Analytics programme. In the midst of the 2021 nor'easter, the FLISR scheme was active on feeders from West Salem and Saugus in the North Shore District in New England. A tree limb created a mainline fault condition between the West Salem substation circuit breaker and the first downstream pole-top recloser on the line. FLISR logic was activated and quickly restored service to 1,531 customers in 16 seconds. The remaining 2,356 customers experiencing the outage had their service restored in 141 minutes after the repairs to the feeder were completed. Had this FLISR scheme not been implemented, all 3,887 customers would have experienced the full outage.\n\nFLISR: installation of recloser.

Although the immediate impact to National Grid was minimal, we increased our focus on risks and strengthened controls associated with cyber and physical security, security of energy supply, political and societal expectations, our supply chains, and sanction compliance.\n\nWe supported the UK government with advice on stabilising energy markets, reducing UK (and EU) dependence on Russian energy and developing the British Energy Security Strategy. We made charity donations and provided electrical equipment to support the Ukrainian people (including 500 diesel generator units).\n\nThe war, heightened energy bills, and changes to/uni00A0UK and EU energy policy have increased uncertainty across the energy sector.

Utilising future scenarios, horizon scanning and emerging risk assessments, we identify ERs/uni00A0that could potentially threaten the achievement of our strategic objectives in/uni00A0the future. Our ongoing ER process includes the identification, assessment, response, and reporting of ERs. Assessment includes the potential impact and velocity (time to impact) and our response is to then either watch, monitor or/uni00A0manage the risks that are reported to the Board and Group ERC using our emerging\n\nrisk radar.\n\n## Changes during the year\n\nThe Company's risk profile has been developed drawing upon the most significant risks across our business profiles. Eight GPRs are now carried at Group ERC and Board level as detailed below. We reviewed all GPRs at least twice during the/uni00A0year, including an assessment of the key controls, the key risk indicators (KRIs), risk scores, alignment to risk appetite, and future mitigation actions. Through these reviews, our data management and disruptive forces risks were identified for de-escalation or retirement. There are no significant flags or hot spots that indicate a shift in risk exposure.\n\nThis year we split our principal climate change risk to establish a discrete transition climate change risk and incorporated the physical impacts from climate change on our assets (adaptation) into our significant disruption of energy risk, to ensure a clear focus on the actions needed to mitigate these different risks. The significant disruption of energy risk focuses on network reliability and resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing our agreement to sell a 60% stake in/uni00A0the UK GT business and completion of our preliminary integration activities associated with/uni00A0the acquisition of WPD, we retired our 'transaction-related' GPR.\n\nContinued economic and political turmoil is significant, with years of global energy policy and/uni00A0strategy increasingly being affected. For National Grid, while our current risk levels are predominantly unchanged, the rapidly evolving situation and uncertainty require very careful monitoring and/uni00A0assessment of our GPRs and ERs.

These risks link to/uni00A0our/uni00A0strategic priority to 'empower colleagues for great performance'.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Actions taken by management\n\nCapability and leadership\n\nThere is a risk that we do not have/uni00A0sufficient capability and leadership capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Risk trend: Neutral (2020/21:/uni00A0Neutral)\n\nStrategic priority link\n\n- * Risk trends are assessed to include any external factors outside our control as well as the strength and effectiveness of our controls and additional mitigations as reviewed by management up to 31 March/uni00A02022.\n\nWe are involved in a number of initiatives to help secure the future engineering talent we require, including industrial placements and internships in the UK and US, advanced and/uni00A0higher apprenticeships in the UK and a/uni00A0graduate development programme across both the US and UK. We are focused on ensuring we have high levels of diversity in these future talent pools. Our entry-level talent development schemes (graduate training and apprenticeships) are a potential source of competitive advantage in the/uni00A0marketplace.\n\nWe also continue to develop the rigour of our/uni00A0succession planning and development planning process, particularly at senior levels. We are now applying it deeper into the organisation as well as giving continued attention to the ethnic diversity of both our/uni00A0management and field force.\n\nThere are multiple activities underway to/uni00A0support/uni00A0this agenda, including 'neutral' talent and selection processes, development interventions and a global launch of our diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) strategy and resources.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nWhile all risks have a direct or indirect financial impact, financial risks are those which relate to financial objectives and performance. Financial risk management is a critical process used to make investment decisions and aims to maximise investment returns and earnings for a given level of risk. None/uni00A0of our financial risks are currently classified as GPR. Our key financial risks are described in note 32 to the financial statements on pages 211 - 223.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of failing to achieve our overall strategic business plans and objectives, as well as failing to have the 'right' strategic plan. We/uni00A0intentionally accept some risk so we can generate the desired returns from our strategy.\n\nManagement of strategic risks focuses on reducing the probability that the inherent risk would materialise, while improving our ability to respond to the risk effectively should it occur. The risk owners, executive leaders and their teams develop and monitor ways to control the risks. These risks link to our strategic priorities of 'enable the energy transition for all' and 'deliver for customers efficiently'. The political climate and policy decisions of/uni00A0our regulators were key considerations in assessing our risks.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Actions taken by management\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere is a risk that we fail to identify and/or deliver upon actions necessary to address the transitional impacts (from a changing energy system) of/uni00A0climate change on our business and demonstrate our leadership of climate change in the energy sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk trend: Neutral (2020/21:/uni00A0Neutral)\n\nStrategic priority link\n\nPutting in place measures to:\n\n- \u00b7  evolve our environmental sustainability metrics to better reflect our strategy, measure our impact and track our progress;\n- \u00b7  address our GHG emissions and meet our sustainability commitments, including net zero by 2050, hosting our first environmental, social and governance (ESG) investor seminar, including the publication of our Responsible Business Charter setting out what responsibility means for us and our commitments and ambitions over the coming years progress is reported in our annual Responsible Business Report;\n- \u00b7  advocate for legislative and policy changes that advance decarbonisation, while proposing and delivering actions in the regions we operate to accelerate decarbonisation for the public and our customers.

These risks normally fall within our low-risk appetite level as there is no strategic benefit from accepting the risk, as it will not be in line with our vision and values.\n\nOur operational principal risks have a low inherent likelihood of occurring. However, should an event occur, without effective prevention or mitigation controls, it would be likely to have a high level of impact. The risk owners, executive leaders and their teams develop and monitor actions to control the risks. Operational risks are managed through policy, standards, procedure-based controls, active prevention and monitoring. The operational risks link to our strategic priority to 'deliver for customers efficiently'. Principal risk assessment includes reasonable worst-case scenario testing, e.g. gas transmission pipeline failure, loss of licence to operate, cyber security attack, and the financial and reputational impact should a single risk or multiple risks materialise.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Actions taken by management\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThere is a risk that we fail to respond to significant disruptive factors caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk trend: Decreasing: driven by the move to 'living/uni00A0with COVID-19' policies/uni00A0in/uni00A0the/uni00A0UK and US (2020/21:/uni00A0Decreasing)\n\nStrategic priority link\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected several areas of our business, and we responded with a comprehensive plan, supporting the safety of our workforce and customers.\n\n- \u00b7  Mitigating procedures are now part of business as usual, with further improvements to the Crisis Management Framework (CMF)/uni00A0planned.\n- \u00b7  As COVID-19 rates reduce and the UK and US begin to move to an endemic status, we expect the risk will be retired as a GPR in/uni00A02022/23.\n\nThroughout 2021/22 we have monitored effects on our people, operations, strategic objectives, regulatory and political engagement, and financial implications.

The process includes financial forecasting, a/uni00A0strict risk management assessment and regular budget reviews/uni00A0and scenario planning incorporating industry trends, considering any emerging issues and economic conditions. Our business strategy aims to enhance our long-term prospects by/uni00A0making sure our operations and/uni00A0finances are/uni00A0sustainable.\n\nUsing our established top-down, bottom-up riskmanagement process, we monitor and challenge the GPRs facing the Company as described on pages 28 - 32. Over the year, the Board has considered the preventative and mitigating controls and risk management actions in place for the GPRs and discussed the potential financial and reputational impact of the GPRs on/uni00A0our ability to achieve the Company's business/uni00A0plan.\n\nThe assessment of the potential impact of/uni00A0our/uni00A0GPRs on the longer-term viability of the Company tests the significant solvency and liquidity risks involved in achieving our business objectives and priorities.

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group financial performance\n\n## Performance management framework\n\nIn managing the business, we focus on various non-IFRS measures which provide meaningful comparisons of performance between years, monitor the strength of the Group's balance sheet as well as profitability and reflect the Group's regulatory economic arrangements. Such alternative and regulatory performance measures are supplementary to, and should not be regarded as a substitute for, IFRS measures, which we refer to as statutory results. We explain the basis of these measures and, where practicable, reconcile these to statutory results in 'Other unaudited financial information' on pages 268 - 279. Our regulatory performance measures have only been calculated for the total Group (or individual entities where relevant), as these are not based on IFRS measures.\n\nSpecifically, we measure the financial performance of the Group from different perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Capital investment and asset growth: Currently we expect to invest c. \u00a37 billion per year.\n- \u00b7 Accounting profit: In addition to statutory IFRS measures we distinguish between adjusted results, which exclude exceptional items and remeasurements, and underlying results, which further take account of: (i) volumetric and other revenue timing differences arising from our regulatory contracts; and (ii) major storm costs, which are recoverable in future periods, neither of which give rise to economic gains or losses. In doing so, we intend to make the impact of such items clear to users of the financial information in this Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Economic profit: Measures such as Return on Equity (RoE) and Value Added take account of the regulated value of our assets and of our regulatory economic arrangements to illustrate the returns generated on shareholder equity.\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet strength: Maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating allows us to finance our growth ambitions at a competitive rate. Hence, we monitor credit metrics used by the major rating agencies to ensure we are generating sufficient cash flow to service our debts.\n\nThis balanced range of measures of financial well-being informs our dividend policy, which from 2021/22 is to grow the dividend per share at least in line with rate of CPIH each year.\n\n## Summary of Group financial performance for the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## Financial summary for continuing operations\n\nLast year we announced that we would make a strategic pivot towards higher growth electricity. On 14 June 2021, we acquired Western Power Distribution plc (WPD) an electricity distribution business based in the South West of the UK. Our planned disposals of the Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) business in Rhode Island and UK Gas Transmission (and metering) are expected to complete during 2022/23. The combination of these transactions has resulted in a change to the Group's structure and a new organisational structure has been implemented.\n\nAs a result, the operating segments reported to our Board have changed from those reported in 2020/21. Our segmental reporting for continuing operations is aligned with our five regulated business units, along with National Grid Ventures (NGV) and Other non-regulated businesses. The UK Electricity System Operator is now separately reported from UK Electricity Transmission. The acquisition of WPD introduces a UK Electricity Distribution segment. Our US Regulated segment has been divided between the jurisdictions of New England and New York, to align more closely with our regulatory framework. Lastly, as part of the new organisational structure, our generation business on Long Island in New York is now reported as part of NGV.\n\nThe expected disposal in the third quarter of 2022/23 of a majority stake in our UK Gas Transmission businesses (including metering, which was previously reported within NGV) means that this business is now classified as a discontinued operation. The expected disposal of NECO does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS, so is reported within New England as part of continuing operations. Both UK Gas Transmission and NECO are classified as held for sale in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2022. NECO was also reported as held for sale in the comparative balance sheet at 31 March 2021.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the following commentary and analyses are for the continuing operations of the Group (as defined by IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations'). Within the Financial review, 'Total Group' refers to results and balances including discontinued or held for sale businesses (as defined by IFRS 5). Where applicable, comparative amounts have been restated accordingly.\n\n## Financial summary for continuing operations\n\n| \u00a3m                                                             | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Statutory results:                                             |           |           |          |\n| Operating profit                                               | 4,371     | 2,401     | 82%      |\n| Profit after tax                                               | 2,183     | 1,304     | 67%      |\n| Earnings per share (pence)                                     | 60.6p     | 37.0p     | 64%      |\n| Dividend per share (pence), including  proposed final dividend | 50.97p    | 49.16p    | 4%       |\n| Capital expenditure                                            | 6,185     | 4,727     | 31%      |\n| Alternative performance measures:                              |           |           |          |\n| Underlying operating profit                                    | 3,992     | 2,688     | 49%      |\n| Underlying profit after tax                                    | 2,351     | 1,493     | 57%      |\n| Adjusted earnings per share (pence)                            | 61.4p     | 36.7p     | 67%      |\n| Underlying earnings per share (pence)                          | 65.3p     | 42.4p     | 54%      |\n| Underlying dividend cover                                      | 1.3       | 0.9       | 49%      |\n| Capital investment                                             | 6,739     | 4,843     | 39%      |\n\n## Financial summary total - including discontinued operations\n\n| \u00a3m                                                                     | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Statutory results:                                                     |           |           |          |\n| Operating profit                                                       | 5,008     | 2,895     | 73%      |\n| Profit after tax                                                       | 2,354     | 1,641     | 43%      |\n| Earnings per share (pence)                                             | 65.4p     | 46.6p     | 40%      |\n| Capital expenditure                                                    | 6,446     | 4,931     | 31%      |\n| Alternative performance measures:                                      |           |           |          |\n| Adjusted operating profit, pre timing and  major storm costs 1         | 4,726     | 3,283     | 44%      |\n| Adjusted profit after tax, pre timing and  major storm costs 1         | 2,760     | 1,911     | 44%      |\n| Adjusted earnings per share (pence)                                    | 71.0p     | 46.4p     | 53%      |\n| Adjusted earnings per share, pre timing  and major storm costs (pence) | 76.7p     | 54.2p     | 42%      |\n| Capital investment                                                     | 7,000     | 5,047     | 39%      |\n| Retained cash flow/adjusted net debt                                   | 8.9%      | 6.6%      | 230bps   |\n| Regulatory performance measures:                                       |           |           |          |\n| Asset growth                                                           | 8.7%      | 5.6%      | 310bps   |\n| Group Return on Equity 2                                               | 11.4%     | 10.6%     | 80bps    |\n| Value Added                                                            | 3,833     | 1,808     | 112%     |\n| Regulatory gearing                                                     | 81%       | 65%       | 1600bps  |\n\nStatutory results from continuing operations of \u00a32,183 million were up \u00a3879 million from the prior year.

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\nUnderlying operating profit for continuing operations was up 49%, driven by the acquisition of WPD, improved performance in NGV, NG Partners and UK Electricity Transmission, along with higher property sales, no depreciation on NECO in New England (held for sale treatment) and a lower adverse impact from COVID-19 compared with 2020/21. Our joint ventures and associates contribution increased (mainly UK interconnector revenues). These factors were partly offset by higher net financing costs from both inflation on RPI-linked debt and interest on a higher level of borrowings related to the acquisition of WPD. Other interest was favourable year-on-year. The tax charge was higher driven by increased taxable profits and additional deferred tax charges in the UK and the US. Underlying profit after tax increased by 57% and resulted in a 54% increase in underlying EPS to 65.3p.\n\nProfit after tax for discontinued operations of \u00a3171 million was down \u00a3166 million compared with the prior year principally due to exceptional\n\ncharges related to deferred tax from the change in the UK corporation tax rate, higher interest costs driven by inflation, partly offset by cessation of depreciation following held for sale treatment and higher revenues under RIIO-2.\n\nCapital investment of \u00a37.0 billion (including discontinued operations of \u00a30.3 billion) along with RAV indexation helped increase our asset growth to 8.7%. We delivered Value Added (our measure of economic profit) of \u00a33.8 billion (including UK Gas Transmission) in 2021/22, significantly higher than in 2020/21 mainly as a result of higher RAV indexation. Group RoE of 11.4% was up from 10.6% for 2020/21. RCF/net debt at 8.9% was higher than 6.6% in 2020/21. The recommended full-year dividend per share of 50.97p is in line with the new policy announced in March 2021 of increasing in line with UK CPIH inflation and is covered 1.3 times by underlying EPS.\n\n## Profitability and earnings\n\nThe table below reconciles our statutory profit measures for continuing operations, at actual exchange rates, to adjusted and underlying versions.\n\n## Reconciliation of profit and earnings from continuing operations\n\n|                    | Operating profit   | Operating profit   | Operating profit   | Profit after tax   | Profit after tax   | Profit after tax   | Earnings per share   | Earnings per share   | Earnings per share   |\n|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| \u00a3m                 | 2021/22            | 2020/21            | Change             | 2021/22            | 2020/21            | Change             | 2021/22              | 2020/21              | Change               |\n| Statutory results  | 4,371              | 2,401              | 82%                | 2,183              | 1,304              | 67%                | 60.6p                | 37.0p                | 64%                  |\n| Exceptional items  | (166)              | 60                 |                    | 320                | 52                 |                    | 8.9p                 | 1.5p                 |                      |\n| Remeasurements     | (392)              | (34)               |                    | (292)              | (62)               |                    | (8.1) p              | (1.8p)               |                      |\n| Adjusted results   | 3,813              | 2,427              | 57%                | 2,211              | 1,294              | 71%                | 61.4p                | 36.7p                | 67%                  |\n| Timing             | 16                 | 111                |                    | 19                 | 88                 |                    | 0.5p                 | 2.5p                 |                      |\n| Major storm costs  | 163                | 150                |                    | 121                | 111                |                    | 3.4p                 | 3.2p                 |                      |\n| Underlying results | 3,992              | 2,688              | 49%                | 2,351              | 1,493              | 57%                | 65.3p                | 42.4p                | 54%                  |\n\n## Reconciliation of profit and earnings from discontinued operations\n\nStatutory operating profit for discontinued operations of \u00a3637 million (2021: \u00a3494 million) includes \u00a317 million of exceptional items (2021: \u00a35 million) and timing under-recovery of \u00a380 million (2021: \u00a396 million). Depreciation of the assets in UK Gas Transmission was ceased following reclassification to held for sale (in accordance with IFRS 5) on 1 September 2021. Tax on exceptional items for discontinued operations comprises a \u00a31 million credit in respect of other exceptional items (2021: \u00a3nil) and a deferred tax exceptional charge related to the change in the UK corporation tax rate of \u00a3145 million (2021: \u00a3nil). In our adjusted results for discontinued operations, tax on timing was \u00a315 million (2021: \u00a318 million). Statutory earnings per share from discontinued operations was 4.8p (2021: 9.6p) and underlying earnings per share from discontinued operations was 11.4p (2021: 11.8p).\n\n## Exceptional income/(expense) from continuing operations\n\n|                                                                                 | Impact on operating profit   | Impact on operating profit   | Impact on profit after tax   | Impact on profit after tax   | Impact on EPS   | Impact on EPS   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| \u00a3m                                                                              | 2021/22                      | 2020/21                      | 2021/22                      | 2020/21                      | 2021/22         | 2020/21         |\n| Environmental insurance recovery and change in environmental provisions         | 38                           | 14                           | 28                           | 11                           | 0.8p            | 0.3p            |\n| Transaction and separation costs                                                | (223)                        | (24)                         | (204)                        | (24)                         | (5.7) p         | (0.7) p         |\n| New operating model implementation costs                                        | (66)                         | (50)                         | (52)                         | (39)                         | (1.4p)          | (1.1) p         |\n| Net gain on disposal of St William joint venture and release of deferred income | 417                          | -                            | 366                          | -                            | 10.1p           | -p              |\n| Deferred tax arising on the change in UK corporation tax rate                   | -                            | -                            | (458)                        | -                            | (12.7p)         | -p              |\n| Total                                                                           | 166                          | (60)                         | (320)                        | (52)                         | (8.9) p         | (1.5) p         |\n\nThis year we have classified the following items as exceptional:\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental insurance recovery: a \u00a338 million gain related to an insurance receivable for site remediation costs related to our US Superfund sites environmental provision, recorded as exceptional in line with the treatment of the related costs;\n- \u00b7 Transaction and separation costs: \u00a3223 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD), the sale of NECO and the sale of UK Gas Transmission (2021: \u00a324 million);\n- \u00b7 New operating model implementation costs and efficiency programme: \u00a366 million of costs in relation to the design and implementation of our new operating model that is designed to transform our operating framework (2021: \u00a350 million);\n- \u00b7 Gain on disposal of St William property joint venture and release of deferred income: \u00a3228 million gain on the divestment of a 50% interest in an equity investment in March 2022 along with release of \u00a3189 million of deferred income arising on historical sales made to that joint venture; and\n- \u00b7 Change in UK corporation tax rate: a \u00a3458 million deferred tax charge for the increase in UK corporation tax rate from 19% to 25% which takes effect from 1 April 2023.\n\nIn the prior year we also classified as exceptional the \u00a314 million credit for partial release of US environmental provisions previously treated as exceptional.\n\nWe also exclude certain unrealised gains and losses on mark-to-market financial instruments from adjusted profit; see notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements for further information. Net remeasurement gains of \u00a3392 million on commodity contract derivatives (i.e. 'mark-to-market' movements on derivatives used to hedge the cost of buying wholesale gas and electricity on behalf of our US customers) occured during the year, in addition to net remeasurement gains of \u00a359 million on financing-related instruments (used to hedge interest and currency risk on net borrowings); along with a further \u00a356 million of remeasurement losses related to our share of post-tax results of joint ventures.\n\nThe expected future exceptional costs related to the new operating model and cost efficiency programme are expected to be in the region of \u00a3100 million.",

Under the Group's regulatory frameworks, most of the revenues we are allowed to collect each year are governed by regulatory price controls in the UK and rate plans in the US. If more than this allowed level of revenue is collected, an adjustment will be made to future prices to reflect this over -recovery; likewise, if less than this level of revenue is collected, an adjustment will be made to future prices in respect of the under-recovery. We also collect revenues from customers and pass these on to third parties (e.g. NYSERDA). These variances between allowed and collected revenues and timing of revenue collections for pass-through costs give rise to over- and under-recoveries.\n\nThe following table summarises management's estimates of such amounts for the two years ended 31 March 2022 for continuing and discontinued operations. All amounts are shown on a pre-tax basis and, where appropriate, opening balances are restated for exchange adjustments and to correspond with subsequent regulatory filings and calculations. All amounts are translated at the current year average exchange rate of $1.35:\u00a31.\n\n| \u00a3m                                                       | 2021/22   | 2020/21 1   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|\n| Balance at start of year (restated)                      | 43        | 259         |\n| In-year (under)/over-recovery - continuing  operations   | (16)      | (111)       |\n| In-year (under)/over-recovery - discontinued  operations | (80)      | (96)        |\n| Balance at end of year                                   | (53)      | 52          |\n\nIn 2021/22, we experienced timing under-recoveries of \u00a385 million in UK Electricity Transmission, over-recoveries of \u00a322 million in UK Electricity Distribution, under-recoveries of \u00a347 million in UK Electricity System Operator, under-recoveries of \u00a332 million in New England and overrecoveries of \u00a3126 million in New York. In calculating the post-tax effect of these timing recoveries, we impute a tax rate, based on the regional marginal tax rates, consistent with the relative mix of UK and US balances.\n\n## Major storm costs\n\nWe also take account of the impact of major storm costs in the US where the aggregate amount is sufficiently material in any given year. Such costs (net of certain deductibles and allowances) are recoverable under our rate plans but are expensed as incurred under IFRS. Accordingly, where the net total incurred cost exceeds $100 million in any given year, we exclude the net costs from underlying earnings. In 2021/22, we incurred deferrable storm costs, which are eligible for future recovery of $220 million (2021: $201 million).\n\n## Segmental operating profit\n\nThe tables below set out operating profit on adjusted and underlying bases.\n\n## Adjusted operating profit\n\n| \u00a3m                             | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| UK Electricity Transmission    | 1,067     | 1,094     | (2) %    |\n| UK Electricity Distribution    | 909       | -         | n/a      |\n| UK Electricity System Operator | 7         | (60)      | (112) %  |\n| New England                    | 743       | 611       | 22%      |\n| New York                       | 780       | 665       | 17%      |\n| NGV and Other activities       | 307       | 117       | 162%     |\n| Continuing operations          | 3,813     | 2,427     | 57%      |\n| Discontinued                   | 654       | 499       | 31%      |\n| Total                          | 4,467     | 2,926     | 53%      |\n\n## Underlying operating profit\n\n| \u00a3m                             | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| UK Electricity Transmission    | 1,152     | 1,052     | 10%      |\n| UK Electricity Distribution    | 887       | -         | n/a      |\n| UK Electricity System Operator | 54        | 70        | (23) %   |\n| New England                    | 886       | 727       | 22%      |\n| New York                       | 706       | 722       | (2) %    |\n| NGV and Other activities       | 307       | 117       | 162%     |\n| Continuing operations          | 3,992     | 2,688     | 49%      |\n\nStatutory operating profit increased in the year, primarily as a result of the 9.5 months' contribution from WPD, the exceptional gain on disposal of our St William joint venture, higher UK Electricity Transmission revenues, increased interconnector revenues and fair value gains in NG Partners, no depreciation of our Rhode Island business and a lower adverse impact from COVID-19 compared with 2020/21. These benefits were partly offset by higher exceptional charges than in 2020/21 along with adverse year-onyear movements on timing recoveries. The reasons for the movements in underlying operating profit are described in the segmental commentaries below. Unless otherwise stated, the discussion of performance in the remainder of this Financial review focuses on underlying results.\n\n## UK Electricity Transmission\n\n| \u00a3m                            | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Revenue                       | 2,035     | 1,974     | 3%       |\n| Operating costs               | (980)     | (894)     | 10%      |\n| Statutory operating profit    | 1,055     | 1,080     | (2) %    |\n| Exceptional items             | 12        | 14        | (14) %   |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 1,067     | 1,094     | (2) %    |\n| Timing                        | 85        | (42)      | (302) %  |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 1,152     | 1,052     | 10%      |\n| Analysed as follows:          |           |           |          |\n| Net revenue                   | 1,883     | 1,823     | 3%       |\n| Regulated controllable costs  | (227)     | (192)     | 18%      |\n| Post-retirement benefits      | (26)      | (32)      | (19) %   |\n| Other operating costs         | (55)      | (44)      | 25%      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (508)     | (461)     | 10%      |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 1,067     | 1,094     | (2) %    |\n| Timing                        | 85        | (42)      | (302) %  |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 1,152     | 1,052     | 10%      |\n\nUK Electricity Transmission statutory operating profit was \u00a325 million lower in the year, mainly due to adverse year-on-year timing movements. In 2021/22, there were \u00a312 million of exceptional costs related to establishing our new operating model (2021: \u00a314 million). Timing under-recoveries of \u00a385 million in 2021/22 compared with over-recoveries of \u00a342 million in 2020/21 are primarily due to the under-recovery of pass-through costs, inflation true-ups and last year's collection of prior period under-recoveries, partly offset by an over-collection of Transmission Network Use of System (TNUoS) revenues in the current year.\n\nAdjusted operating profit reduced by \u00a327 million (2%), but this included \u00a3127 million adverse year-on-year timing movements. Underlying operating profit increased by 10%. Net revenues (adjusted for timing) were higher under the first year of RIIO-T2, with indexation and lower totex capitalisation rates (increased 'fast money') offsetting the lower returns in the current year. In the prior year, revenue was impacted by an adverse MOD adjustment in the final year of the RIIO-T1 price control.\n\nRegulated controllable costs were higher from additional workload agreed for RIIO-T2, inflationary increases and the non-recurrence of favourable credits in 2020/21, which more than offset 2021/22 efficiency savings and the absence of prior period COVID-19-related costs. Other costs were higher, mainly relating to a \u00a310 million settlement related to Western Link.\n\nThe increase in depreciation and amortisation reflects continued investment. In 2021/22, a benefit arising from the review of assets' useful economic lives was broadly offset by asset write-offs.",

The results presented are for the 9.5-month period of ownership and no amounts for WPD are included in the consolidated results of the Group for year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nStatutory operating profit of \u00a3909 million for the 9.5 months included \u00a322 million of timing over-recoveries of 'Distribution Use of System' (DUoS) volumes and the adverse impact on our revenues from UK corporation tax capital allowance 'super deductions', partly offset by an under-collection of earned incentives and inflation true-ups. Excluding timing, underlying profit was \u00a3887 million for the 9.5 months of ownership since June 2021. Controllable costs and post-retirement benefit costs of \u00a3204 million were lower than the estimated equivalent period in the prior year, mainly as a result of the disruption arising from COVID-19 during 2020/21. These costs include engineering management costs, supporting our customers and the maintenance of our four electricity distribution networks, including activities such as vegetation management in order to prevent line damage. Depreciation and amortisation charges include amortisation of fair value adjustments applied to property, plant and equipment (PP&E) at the date of acquisition.\n\n## UK Electricity System Operator\n\n| \u00a3m                                | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Revenue                           | 3,455     | 2,018     | 71%      |\n| Operating costs                   | (3,450)   | (2,071)   | 67%      |\n| Statutory operating profit/(loss) | 5         | (53)      | (109) %  |\n| Exceptional items                 | 2         | (7)       | (129) %  |\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)  | 7         | (60)      | (112) %  |\n| Timing                            | 47        | 130       | (64) %   |\n| Underlying operating profit       | 54        | 70        | (23) %   |\n| Analysed as follows:              |           |           |          |\n| Net revenue                       | 240       | 107       | 124%     |\n| Controllable costs                | (129)     | (99)      | 30%      |\n| Post-retirement benefits          | (16)      | (13)      | 23%      |\n| Other operating costs             | (5)       | (9)       | (44) %   |\n| Depreciation and amortisation     | (83)      | (46)      | 80%      |\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)  | 7         | (60)      | (112) %  |\n| Timing                            | 47        | 130       | (64) %   |\n| Underlying operating profit       | 54        | 70        | (23) %   |\n\nUK Electricity System Operator statutory operating profit increased \u00a358 million in the year. In 2021/22 there were \u00a32 million of exceptional costs related to establishing our new operating model, compared to a \u00a37 million credit related to release of previous reorganisation provisions in the prior year. Timing under-recoveries of \u00a347 million in 2021/22 compared with under -recoveries of \u00a3130 million in the prior year. Timing in 2021/22 predominately included \u00a344 million for the Balancing Services Use of System (BSUoS) price cap deferral support scheme compared with \u00a3109 million in 2020/21 for TNUoS demand under-recovery during COVID-19 and \u00a322 million for the BSUoS Covid Support Scheme.\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased by \u00a367 million almost entirely driven by the \u00a383 million year-on-year timing movement, partly offset by asset impairments. Excluding the impact of timing, underlying operating profit decreased by 23%. Net revenue (adjusted for timing) was \u00a350 million higher, reflecting higher revenues under RIIO-2 related to additional workload agreed under the new price control and higher earned incentives. Regulated controllable costs including pensions were \u00a333 million higher in total, in line with the expected higher volume of work required to deliver the ambitious RIIO-2 business plan. Depreciation and amortisation was \u00a337 million higher as a result of our investment in transformational IT systems, in addition to asset impairments for work that may no longer be required.\n\n## New England\n\n| \u00a3m                            | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Revenue                       | 4,550     | 4,214     | 8%       |\n| Operating costs               | (3,786)   | (3,600)   | 5%       |\n| Statutory operating profit    | 764       | 614       | 24%      |\n| Exceptional items             | 80        | 8         | 900%     |\n| Remeasurements                | (101)     | (11)      | 818%     |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 743       | 611       | 22%      |\n| Timing                        | 32        | 11        | 191%     |\n| Major storm costs             | 111       | 105       | 6%       |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 886       | 727       | 22%      |\n| Analysed as follows:          |           |           |          |\n| Net revenue                   | 2,500     | 2,430     | 3%       |\n| Regulated controllable costs  | (813)     | (810)     | -        |\n| Post-retirement benefits      | (40)      | (43)      | (7) %    |\n| Bad debt expense              | (45)      | (127)     | (65) %   |\n| Other operating costs         | (494)     | (450)     | 10%      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (365)     | (389)     | (6) %    |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 743       | 611       | 22%      |\n| Timing                        | 32        | 11        | 191%     |\n| Major storm costs             | 111       | 105       | 6%       |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 886       | 727       | 22%      |\n\nNew England statutory operating profit increased by \u00a3150 million, as a result of the \u00a390 million year-on-year favourable movements in commodity contract remeasurements (which are passed on to customers), mostly offset by exceptional charges booked in the current year for the disposal of our Rhode Island business and the cost efficiency programme. In 2020/21, exceptional charges were lower, comprising \u00a38 million of costs related to establishing our new operating model and transaction costs. Timing under -recoveries of \u00a332 million in 2021/22 compared with timing underrecoveries of \u00a311 million in 2020/21, related to revenue decoupling and recovery of cost on our energy efficiency programme. Storm costs (deferrable and non-deferrable) were broadly flat year-on-year, with a lower number of storm events occurring during 2021/22, but a higher 'per storm' cost. These factors, along with an adverse impact from COVID-19 in the prior year and exchange movements, resulted in an overall increase in statutory operating profit and adjusted operating profit.",

Major storm costs of \u00a3111 million exceed our threshold to be excluded from underlying, but were a repeat of the high level of deferrable storm costs we incurred in 2020/21. Underlying operating profit increased by 22%. Net revenues (adjusted for timing) increased by \u00a391 million from the benefits of rate case increments in Massachusetts Gas and Massachusetts Electric, capital trackers and higher revenues from new customer connections along with income from sale of property. New England controllable costs were held broadly flat year-on-year, with increases from higher workload, IT costs and inflationary impacts, being mostly offset by efficiency savings, favourable settlements and non-recurrence of costs incurred in the prior period including COVID-19 disruption costs. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts of \u00a345 million were \u00a382 million lower than 2020/21, which had additional provision for receivables related to the impact of COVID-19. Depreciation and amortisation increased due to the growth in assets, but was more than offset by a benefit from cessation of depreciation in NECO as a result of it being reclassified to held for sale. Other costs were higher due to increased property taxes and increases in environmental reserves.\n\n## New York\n\n| \u00a3m                            | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Revenue                       | 5,561     | 4,605     | 21%      |\n| Operating costs               | (4,466)   | (3,910)   | 14%      |\n| Statutory operating profit    | 1,095     | 695       | 58%      |\n| Exceptional items             | (24)      | (7)       | n/a      |\n| Remeasurements                | (291)     | (23)      | n/a      |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 780       | 665       | 17%      |\n| Timing                        | (126)     | 12        | n/a      |\n| Major storm costs             | 52        | 45        | 16%      |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 706       | 722       | (2) %    |\n| Analysed as follows:          |           |           |          |\n| Net revenue                   | 3,400     | 3,136     | 8%       |\n| Regulated controllable costs  | (963)     | (981)     | (2) %    |\n| Post-retirement benefits      | (44)      | (47)      | (6) %    |\n| Bad debt expense              | (87)      | (198)     | (56) %   |\n| Other operating costs         | (989)     | (792)     | 25%      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation | (537)     | (453)     | 19%      |\n| Adjusted operating profit     | 780       | 665       | 17%      |\n| Timing                        | (126)     | 12        | n/a      |\n| Major storm costs             | 52        | 45        | 16%      |\n| Underlying operating profit   | 706       | 722       | (2) %    |\n\nNew York statutory operating profit increased by \u00a3400 million, principally as a result of the \u00a3268 million year-on-year favourable movements in commodity contract remeasurements (which are passed on to customers) and net exceptional gains including \u00a338 million environmental insurance recovery for costs related to our obligations to clean up Superfund sites, compared to a \u00a314 million environmental credit (reversal of cost previously booked as exceptional) in the prior year. Timing over-recoveries of \u00a3126 million in 2021/22 compared with timing under-recoveries of \u00a312 million in 2020/21, driven by commodity price fluctuations and high auction sale prices on transmission wheeling. Major (i.e. deferrable) storm costs of \u00a352 million were \u00a37 million higher year-on-year, but as in 2020/21, the total costs passed our threshold ($100 million in aggregate with New England) and so are excluded from our underlying results. These factors, along with a prior year adverse impact from COVID-19 disruption resulted in an overall increase in statutory operating profit and in adjusted operating profit.\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased by \u00a3115 million (17%), aided by \u00a3138 million year-on-year favourable timing swings and lower year-on-year impact of COVID-19, but partly offset by higher environmental charges in 2021/22. After further adjusting to exclude the impact of timing and major storm costs, underlying operating profit decreased by 2%. Net revenues (adjusted for timing) increased by \u00a3126 million from the benefits of rate case increases in KEDNY, KEDLI and Niagara Mohawk (partly offset by use of deferral credits to reduce the impact on customer bill increases and a 'make whole' adjustment for the rate case settlement in downstate New York). Regulated controllable costs were lower year-on-year, with increased workload and IT costs and also inflationary impacts, more than offset by cost efficiency savings, favourable credits in 2021/22 and the non-recurrence of costs arising in 2020/21. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts decreased by \u00a3111 million, driven by 2020/21's additional provision for receivables related to the impact of COVID-19. Depreciation and amortisation increased due to the growth in assets and the accelerated depreciation of certain gas assets and IT systems. Other costs were higher due to an increase in environmental provisions (mostly driven by inflation), increased property taxes, cost of removal and customer funded work, partly offset by receipt of a historical property tax refund.\n\n## NGV and Other activities\n\n| \u00a3m                             | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Statutory operating profit     | 543       | 65        | 735%     |\n| Exceptional items              | (236)     | 52        | (554) %  |\n| Adjusted operating profit      | 307       | 117       | 162%     |\n| Timing                         | -         | -         | n/a      |\n| Underlying operating profit    | 307       | 117       | 162%     |\n| Analysed as follows:           |           |           |          |\n| NGV                            | 286       | 185       | 55%      |\n| Property                       | 40        | 22        | 82%      |\n| Corporate and Other activities | (19)      | (90)      | (79) %   |\n| Underlying operating profit    | 307       | 117       | 162%     |\n\nNGV's statutory operating profits were \u00a3100 million higher than 2020/21, driven by higher interconnector revenues, which benefited from a full year's contribution from our second French interconnector (IFA2) and the commissioning of North Sea Link earlier than expected, along with the impact of higher commodity prices and increased revenues in our onshore renewables in the US. These were partly offset by a write-down for assets damaged by a fire at Sellindge in September 2021, which caused an unplanned outage for our legacy French interconnector (IFA1) and a \u00a33 million exceptional charge in relation to establishing our new operating model (2021: \u00a32 million).\n\nIn Other activities, we incurred an exceptional gain of \u00a3417 million related to the disposal of our 50% interest in the St William property joint venture and release of associated deferred income on historical sales made to the joint venture. We also incurred an exceptional charge of \u00a322 million related to establishing our new operating model (2021: \u00a326 million), \u00a395 million (2021: \u00a324 million) of transaction costs for the acquisition of WPD, and \u00a361 million of costs incurred for the separation of NECO and UK Gas Transmission. In 2021/22, underlying operating profit of \u00a321 million (including corporate costs), compared with net costs of \u00a368 million in 2020/21. This increase included benefits from higher fair value gains on our NG Partners investments and the release of an aged liability related to historical balances for unclaimed dividends in the Group. Excluding the gain on disposal of St William, the underlying performance of the property business was up \u00a318 million, driven by increased sales compared with 2020/21.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review continued\n\n## Financing costs and taxation - continuing\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs (excluding remeasurements) for the year were 25% higher than last year at \u00a31,081 million, with the \u00a3216 million increase driven by interest costs of \u00a3130 million (net of amortisation of debt fair value adjustments) for debt acquired with WPD, \u00a399 million of interest and fees for \u00a38 billion of additional borrowings used to finance the acquisition, a \u00a3145 million impact of higher inflation on our RPI-linked debt and an increase in borrowings as a result of organic asset growth. These higher costs were partly offset by favourable year-on-year non-debt interest income, with benefits from interest on pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) liabilities, increased capitalised interest and higher levels of other interest income from US financial investments compared with 2020/21. The effective interest rate for continuing operations of 3.2% is in line with the prior year rate.\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Group's share of net profits from joint ventures and associates increased by \u00a382 million compared with 2020/21, mainly as a result of higher interconnector revenues in both Nemo Link up \u00a337 million and in BritNed up \u00a328 million and higher sales in our St William property joint venture (prior to disposal of this investment in March 2022) and an improved contribution from our joint venture investment in NG Partners.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe underlying effective tax rate (excluding joint ventures and associates) of 24.3% was 260bps higher than last year (2020/21: 21.7%). The tax charge in 2021/22 included additional deferred tax charges in the UK for the change in the UK corporation tax rate and the unitary state deferred tax remeasurement which occurred as a result of the expected sale of our Rhode Island business in the US. The Group's tax strategy is detailed later in this review.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nOn 27 March 2021, we announced the agreed sale of 100% of our UK Gas Transmission business (including metering) to a new entity (the 'Acquiring Entity') in exchange for \u00a32.2 billion cash consideration, \u00a32.0 billion of debt financing and a 40% interest in the Acquiring Entity on completion. The other 60% in the Acquiring Entity will be owned by a consortium of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation. The sale is expected to complete in the third quarter of this financial year subject to the receipt of all regulatory approvals. The results of our 100% share of this business (including metering) are presented as 'discontinued operations' in 2021/22, with comparatives restated accordingly. On 1 September 2021, this business met the IFRS 5 criteria to be classified as held for sale and depreciation was stopped from that date. As described in note 10 to the financial statements, separation and transaction costs relating to the disposal of this business are included within discontinued operations.\n\nUK Gas Transmission (including metering)\n\n| \u00a3m                                            | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| Revenue                                       | 1,374     | 1,122     | 22%      |\n| Operating costs                               | (737)     | (628)     | 17%      |\n| Statutory operating profit                    | 637       | 494       | 29%      |\n| Exceptional items                             | 17        | 5         | 240%     |\n| Adjusted operating profit                     | 654       | 499       | 31%      |\n| Timing                                        | 80        | 96        | (17) %   |\n| Adjusted operating profit  (excluding timing) | 734       | 595       | 23%      |\n| Analysed as follows:                          |           |           |          |\n| Net revenue                                   | 977       | 889       | 10%      |\n| Regulated controllable costs                  | (160)     | (157)     | 2%       |\n| Post-retirement benefits                      | (17)      | (18)      | (6) %    |\n| Other operating costs                         | (55)      | (28)      | 96%      |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                 | (91)      | (187)     | (51) %   |\n| Adjusted operating profit                     | 654       | 499       | 31%      |\n| Timing                                        | 80        | 96        | (17) %   |\n| Adjusted operating profit  (excluding timing) | 734       | 595       | 23%      |\n\nUK Gas Transmission statutory operating profit increased \u00a3143 million in the year. In 2021/22, there were \u00a314 million of costs incurred in separating the business from the Group and transaction-related costs in preparation of the sales process; and \u00a33 million (2021: \u00a35 million) of exceptional costs related to the reorganisation and cost efficiency programme. Timing under-recoveries of \u00a380 million arose in 2021/22, mainly related to recovery of shrinkage costs from higher gas prices. This compared with under-recoveries of \u00a396 million in the prior year from under-collections relating to the change to the gas capacity charging regime and lower demand, partly offset by a lower return of prior period over -recoveries.\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased by \u00a3155 million (31%), including \u00a316 million less adverse timing year-on-year. Excluding the impact of timing, adjusted operating profit increased by 23%, mostly from the cessation of depreciation since 31 August 2021, when the business was classified as held for sale. In 2021/22, depreciation of \u00a391 million was \u00a396 million lower than the prior year. Net revenue was \u00a388 million higher, reflecting new prices under RIIO-T2 and the impact of the change to CPIH and regulatory depreciation profile change under the new price control. Regulated controllable costs (including pensions) and other costs were \u00a329 million higher as a result of increased customer-funded works, higher Network Innovation Competition costs, higher meter displacements and a beneficial provision release in the prior period.\n\nWithin UK Gas Transmission, our non-regulated metering business's operating profit of \u00a3150 million was in line with the prior year, with the benefit from lower depreciation being offset by the adverse impact of fewer meters as these are being phased out and replaced by smart meters.",

        "page_content": "## Capital investment, asset growth and Value Added\n\nValue Added is a measure that reflects the value to shareholders of our dividend and the growth in National Grid's regulated and non-regulated assets (as measured in our regulated asset base, for regulated entities), net of the growth in overall debt. It is a key metric used to measure our performance and underpins our approach to sustainable decision-making. Value Growth, which is derived from Value Added, forms part of our long-term management incentive arrangements.\n\nA key part of our investor proposition is growth in our regulated asset base. The regulated asset base is a regulatory construct, representing the invested capital on which we are authorised to earn a cash return. By investing efficiently in our networks, we add to our regulatory asset base over the long term and this in turn contributes to delivering shareholder value. Our regulated asset base comprises our regulatory asset value in the UK, plus our rate base in the US. We also invest in related activities that are not subject to network regulation and this further contributes to asset growth.\n\n## Capital investment\n\nCapital investment comprises capital expenditure in critical energy infrastructure, equity investments, funding contributions and loans to joint ventures and associates and, in the case of National Grid Partners, investments in financial assets.\n\n|                                | At actual exchange rates   | At actual exchange rates   | At actual exchange rates   | At constant currency   | At constant currency   | At constant currency   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| \u00a3m                             | 2021/22                    | 2020/21                    | Change                     | 2021/22                | 2020/21                | Change                 |\n| UK Electricity Transmission    | 1,195                      | 984                        | 21%                        | 1,195                  | 984                    | 21%                    |\n| UK Electricity Distribution    | 899                        | -                          | n/a                        | 899                    | -                      | n/a                    |\n| UK Electricity System Operator | 108                        | 88                         | 23%                        | 108                    | 88                     | 23%                    |\n| New England                    | 1,561                      | 1,437                      | 9%                         | 1,561                  | 1,429                  | 9%                     |\n| New York                       | 1,960                      | 1,738                      | 13%                        | 1,960                  | 1,729                  | 13%                    |\n| NGV and Other activities       | 1,016                      | 596                        | 70%                        | 1,016                  | 596                    | 70%                    |\n| Continuing                     | 6,739                      | 4,843                      | 39%                        | 6,739                  | 4,826                  | 40%                    |\n| Discontinued                   | 261                        | 204                        | 28%                        | 261                    | 204                    | 28%                    |\n| Total Group                    | 7,000                      | 5,047                      | 39%                        | 7,000                  | 5,030                  | 39%                    |\n\nCapital investment in UK Electricity Transmission increased by \u00a3211 million compared with 2020/21, primarily due to London Power Tunnels 2 and Hinkley-Seabank, partly offset by lower Smartwires spend. The acquisition of WPD during the year resulted in a \u00a3899 million increase in reported capital investment year-on-year. In New England, capital investment was up \u00a3132 million on a constant currency basis, reflecting higher spend on gas assets driven by decreased COVID-19 restrictions compared with 2020/21 and higher investment in electric assets related to asset condition. In New York, capital investment was \u00a3231 million higher (on a constant currency basis), as a result of accelerated leak-prone pipe replacement work in our gas businesses, investment in Northwest Nassau connection, higher investment in our electric assets to reinforce the network and increase capacity and reliability, investment in SmartPath Connect and Energy Highway, and decreased COVID-19 restrictions compared with 2020/21. Capital investment in NGV was significantly higher than in 2020/21, with continued investment in the Viking Link interconnector (Denmark), increased spend on our Grain LNG facility, partly offset by completion of the North Sea Link interconnector (Norway) this year, but a \u00a3373 million step up in US Ventures' capital investment, including purchase of a 3.2 GW potential offshore wind seabed lease in New York. In addition, a total amount of \u00a393 million was invested by National Grid Partners in 2021/22, compared to \u00a338 million in the prior year.\n\nIn UK Gas Transmission, capital investment increased by \u00a357 million from non-load spend, with increased work at St Fergus, continued investment at Peterborough and Huntingdon compressor stations, increased investment at Hatton and higher cyber spend compared to 2020/21.\n\n## Asset Growth and Value Added\n\nTo help readers' assessment of the financial position of the Group, the table below shows an aggregated position for the Group, as viewed from a regulatory perspective. The measures included in the table below are calculated in part from financial information used to derive measures sent to and used by our regulators in the UK and US, and accordingly inform certain of the Group's regulatory performance measures, but are not derived from, and cannot be reconciled to, IFRS. These alternative performance measures include regulatory assets and liabilities and certain IFRS assets and liabilities of businesses that are classified as held for sale under IFRS 5.\n\nThere are certain significant assets and liabilities included in our IFRS balance sheet, which are treated differently in the analysis below, and to which we draw readers' attention. Our UK OpCo RAVs are different to the IFRS carrying value of PP&E and intangibles in these entities. This is a result of the annual indexation (inflationary uplift) adjustment applied to RAV compared with the IFRS value of these assets (which are held at amortised cost), or in the case of WPD, the result of acquisition fair value adjustments (where PP&E at acquisition has been valued above RAV). In addition, under IFRS we recognise liabilities in respect of US environmental remediation costs, and pension and OPEB costs. For regulatory purposes, these are not shown as obligations because we are entitled to full recovery of costs through our existing rate plans. The impact of US tax reform in 2017/18 which resulted in a reduction in IFRS deferred tax liabilities, and from a regulatory perspective remains as a future obligation, results in a regulatory liability within US rate base (\u00a30.7 billion in New England and \u00a30.9 billion in New York at 31 March 2022). In our Value Added calculation, we have recognised an asset to reflect expected future recovery of \u00a3202 million COVID-19-related provision for bad and doubtful debts that we have included in 2021/22 (2021: \u00a3179 million). Regulatory IOUs which reflect net over- or under-recoveries compared with our regulatory allowances are treated within this table as obligations but do not qualify for recognition as liabilities (or assets) under IFRS. The increase in regulatory assets and other balances (including goodwill) and the increase in net debt as a result of the WPD acquisition along with associated transaction costs have been excluded when calculating the in-year Value Added for 2021/22. However, these balances are included within amounts reported as at 31 March 2022. Adjusted net debt movements exclude movements on derivatives which are designated in cash flow hedging arrangements and for which there is no corresponding movement in total assets and other balances. Within our Value Added calculation, total assets and other balances, goodwill and adjusted net debt movement all exclude the impact of reclassifications to held for sale for NECO in 2020/21 and the UK Gas business in 2021/22. Separation and transaction costs related to the disposal of these entities are also excluded from in-year Value Added and have been deferred to match against the anticipated proceeds on disposal of these businesses in 2022/23.",

This was higher than last year's \u00a31.8 billion, with \u00a31.0 billion of the year-on-year increase arising from higher RAV indexation in UK Transmission, \u00a30.8 billion of RAV growth from WPD (for the 9.5 months owned in 2021/22), stronger NGV and Other performance, higher US returns and a smaller adverse impact from COVID-19 compared with 2020/21, offset by higher interest and increased tax paid. Of the \u00a33.8 billion Value Added, \u00a30.9 billion was paid to shareholders as cash dividends and \u00a32.9 billion was retained in the business. Value Added per share was 106.5p compared with 51.3p in 2020/21.",

Includes \u00a344 million cash and cash equivalents acquired with WPD\n\nCash flow generated from continuing operations was \u00a35.8 billion, \u00a31,821 million higher than last year, mainly due to the contribution from WPD, lower adverse year-on-year timing under-recoveries, higher revenues compared to 2020/21, higher spend on provisions and exceptional charges, offset by favourable working capital inflows on payables. Cash expended on investment activities increased as a result of continued organic growth in our regulated and non-regulated businesses, the impact of acquiring WPD, partly offset by disposal of financial investments.\n\nThe disposal of our St William investment in March 2022 generated \u00a3413 million of proceeds in the year. The cash acquisition of WPD in June 2021 for \u00a37.9 billion increased net debt, along with a further \u00a38.2 billion increase from the fair value of net debt acquired. Net interest paid increased as a result of the bridge loan taken out to finance the purchase of WPD, interest for borrowings acquired with WPD and increased base rates on borrowings. The Group made net tax payments of \u00a3298 million during 2021/22. The cash dividend of \u00a3922 million, reflected a higher scrip uptake of 48% (2021: 17%).\n\nDiscontinued operations represents UK Gas Transmission and Metering which generated higher cash inflows in 2021/22, principally as a result of improved year-on-year performance and no pension deficit payments in 2021/22. Non-cash movements primarily reflect changes in the sterlingdollar exchange rate, accretions on index-linked debt, lease additions and other derivative fair value movements, offset by the amortisation of fair value adjustments on the debt acquired with WPD. Closing net debt of \u00a342.8 billion excludes \u00a31.2 billion of net debt in NECO and \u00a34.1 billion of net debt in NG Gas plc which has been classified as held for sale on 31 March 2022.\n\nDuring the year we raised over \u00a34.2 billion of new long-term senior debt to refinance maturing debt and to fund a portion of our significant capital programme. The new bonds issued include further borrowings under our Green Financing Framework. In addition, we raised \u00a38.2 billion under a bridge financing facility to fund the purchase of the UK Electricity Distribution business. This bridge facility remained outstanding at 31 March 2022 as we continue to progress the sales of our US Rhode Island business and our UK Gas Transmission business. We expect the proceeds from these sales to be received, and for the bridge facility to be repaid in full, this financial year (2022/23).\n\nAs at 18 May 2022, we have \u00a36.8 billion of undrawn committed facilities available for general corporate purposes, including \u00a3350 million related to National Grid Gas plc, all of which have expiry dates beyond May 2023. National Grid's balance sheet remains robust, with strong investment grade ratings from Moody's, Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch.\n\nThe Board has considered the Group's ability to finance normal operations as well as funding a significant capital programme, taking account of the disruption caused by the energy crisis. This includes stress-testing of the Group's finances under a 'reasonable worst case' scenario, assessing the timing of the NECO and National Grid Gas plc transactions, and the further levers at the Board's discretion to ensure our businesses are adequately financed. As a result, the Board has concluded that the Group will have adequate resources to do so.",

Property, plant and equipment increased as a result of the continuing capital investment programme, the acquisition of WPD and foreign exchange gains offset by reclassifications to held for sale. Assets held for sale comprises assets and liabilities of NECO and UK Gas Transmission (including metering) both of which we expect to sell during 2022/23 (see note 10 to the financial statements). Tax balances increased principally as a result of the acquisition of WPD, deferred tax on actuarial gains on pension assets, accelerated tax depreciation from ongoing capital investment and the impact of the UK tax rate change on deferred tax balances. Net pension assets increased in both the US and UK as a result of higher asset valuations from investment returns, higher discount rates on liabilities and foreign exchange movements along with the acquisition of WPD. Provisions were higher principally as a result of increases in environmental and other provisions, the impact of acquiring WPD and foreign exchange movements. Other movements are largely explained by net working capital inflows, reclassifications to held for sale, the impact of the acquisition of WPD and changes in the sterling-dollar exchange rate.\n\nRegulatory gearing, measured as net debt as a proportion of total regulatory asset value and other business invested capital increased significantly in the year to 81% as at 31 March 2022. This was up from 65% at the previous year end, principally as a result of an \u00a38 billion 'bridge loan' used to acquire the equity of WPD and \u00a38 billion fair value of net debt acquired with WPD. The proceeds from the sales of NECO and UK Gas Transmission expected to occur in 2022/23 will be used to repay this loan, which would substantially reduce the level of gearing in the Group. Taking into account the benefit of our hybrid debt, adjusted gearing as at 31 March 2022 was 80%. Once this bridge loan is repaid, gearing should return to a level appropriate for the current overall Group credit rating of BBB+/Baa1 (S&P/Moody's).\n\nRetained cash flow as a proportion of adjusted net debt was 8.9%. This is above the long-term average level of 7% indicated by Moody's, as consistent with maintaining our current Group rating.\n\n## Off-balance sheet items\n\nThere were no significant off-balance sheet items other than the commitments and contingencies detailed in note 30 of the financial statements.\n\n## Economic returns\n\nIn addition to Value Added, one of the principal ways in which we measure our performance in generating value for shareholders is to divide regulated financial performance by regulatory equity, to produce RoE.\n\nAs explained on page 274, regulated financial performance adjusts reported operating profit to reflect the impact of the Group's various regulatory economic arrangements in the UK and US. In order to show underlying performance, we calculate RoE measures excluding exceptional items of income or expenditure.\n\nGroup RoE is used to measure our performance in generating value for our shareholders by dividing regulated and non-regulated financial performance, after interest and tax, by our measure of equity investment in all our businesses, including the regulated businesses, NGV and Other activities and joint ventures. Group RoE includes our UK Gas Transmission business.\n\nRegulated RoEs are measures of how the businesses are performing compared with the assumptions and allowances set by our regulators. US jurisdictional and UK entity regulated returns are calculated using the capital structure assumed within their respective regulatory arrangements and, in the case of the UK, assuming inflation of 3% RPI under RIIO-1 and 2% CPIH under RIIO-2. As these assumptions differ between the UK and the US, RoE measures are not directly comparable between the two geographies. In our performance measures, we compare achieved RoEs to the level assumed when setting base rate and revenue allowances in each jurisdiction.\n\n## Return on Equity\n\n| \u00a3m                          | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | Change   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|\n| UK Electricity Transmission | 7.7 %     | 13.8 %    | -610 bps |\n| UK Electricity Distribution | 13.6 %    | n/a       | n/a      |\n| UK Gas Transmission         | 7.8 %     | 9.6 %     | -180 bps |\n| New England                 | 8.3 %     | 7.5 %     | 80 bps   |\n| New York                    | 8.8 %     | 6.7 %     | 210 bps  |\n| Group Return on Equity\u00b9     | 11.4 %    | 10.6 %    | 80 bps   |\n\nAs a result of the new RIIO-2 price control, the allowed returns that UK Electricity Transmission and UK Gas Transmission can earn have decreased compared with the allowed returns under RIIO-1. In 2021/22, UK Electricity Transmission achieved operational returns of 7.7%, 140bps higher than base allowed return under RIIO-2, mainly from totex performance related to savings on capital delivery. UK Electricity Distribution achieved an operational return of 13.6% in 2021/22 under RIIO-1, or 400bps outperformance, mostly as a result of strong incentives performance, but also totex outperformance driven by efficient capital expenditure. UK Gas Transmission's return decreased due to lower returns allowed under the new RIIO-2 price control, but achieved operational returns in 2021/22 were 7.8%, 110bps higher than allowed, from totex outperformance, driven by cost efficiencies and incentives.\n\nNew England's achieved return of 8.3% was 85% of the allowed return of 9.8% in 2021/22 as a result of higher IT and workforce costs, but this was an improvement on the achieved return of 7.5% or 77% of the allowed return in 2020/21, driven by rate increases and a smaller adverse impact from COVID-19 compared with the prior year. New York's achieved return of 8.8% was 99% of the allowed return of 8.9% in 2021/22. This was an improvement compared with an achieved return of 6.7% in 2020/21, as a result of new rate agreements and a property tax rebate in the current year, and non-deferrable storm costs exceeding allowances plus non-recurring charges in the prior year. The quoted returns for New England and New York represent the weighted average return across OpCos within each jurisdiction. US returns were not affected by the COVID-19-related bad debt provisions recognised in 2020/21 which included an adjustment reflecting our expectation for future recovery of these bad debt costs.\n\nOverall Group RoE, which incorporates NGV, Property, Corporate and Other plus financing and tax performance was 11.4%.",

Our approach to tax is consistent with the Group's broader commitments to doing business responsibly and upholding the highest ethical standards. This includes managing our tax affairs, as we recognise that our tax contribution supports public services and the wider economy. We endeavour to manage our tax affairs so that we pay and collect the right amount of tax, at the right time, in accordance with the tax laws in all the territories in which we operate. We will claim valid tax reliefs and incentives where these are applicable to our business operations, but only where they are widely accepted through the relevant tax legislation such as those established by government to promote investment, employment and economic growth. We do not have operations in tax havens or low tax jurisdictions without commercial purpose.\n\nWe have a strong governance framework and our internal control and risk management framework helps us manage risks, including tax risk, appropriately. We take a conservative approach to tax risk. However, there is no prescriptive level or pre-defined limit to the amount of acceptable tax risk.\n\nOur financial statements have been audited. The figures in the tax transparency disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts have been taken from our financial systems, which are subject to our internal control framework.\n\nWe act with openness and honesty when engaging with relevant tax authorities and seek to work with tax authorities on a real-time basis. We engage proactively in developments of external tax policy and engage with relevant bodies where appropriate.

The Guernsey captive was acquired as part of the acquisition of the WPD Group during the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\nOur Hong Kong entity is UK tax resident and is now dormant and our entities in Australia and Canada are dormant. Our entity in Ireland is in liquidation and our entities in Jersey were fully liquidated and dissolved during the period. Therefore, those jurisdictions have not been included in the table above.\n\nOur Isle of Man and Guernsey companies are captive insurance companies which are treated as controlled foreign companies for UK tax purposes and as such UK corporation tax is paid on their profits by National Grid. In the Netherlands, we have a finance company which borrowed money externally and on-lent it to another Group company. Both loans have now been settled. It is taxed on its profits in the Netherlands at the corporate tax rate of 25%.\n\nAs part of our response to the Labour Party's proposal to nationalise nearly all of National Grid's UK assets we implemented measures, which included a Luxembourg holding company, in order to strengthen our ability to get a fair value for the assets in the event of a nationalisation.\n\nTransfer pricing is not a significant issue for the Group since there are limited transactions between Group companies, but any transactions between related parties are made on an arm's-length basis and aligned to OECD principles.",

The difference between this and the accounting effective rate of 38.8% is due to the following factors.\n\nAn increase in future tax rates impacting the calculation of deferred taxes.\n\nNational Grid is a capital-intensive business, across both the UK and the US, and as such invests significant sums each year in its networks. In 2021/22 the Group's total capital expenditure was \u00a36,446 million. To promote investment, tax legislation allows a deduction for qualifying capital expenditure at a faster rate than the associated depreciation in the statutory accounts. The impact of this is to defer cash tax payments into future years.\n\nIn the current period, the US federal taxable income was offset by broughtforward net operating losses which primarily arose from deductions for qualifying capital expenditure incurred by National Grid in earlier years. Hence no significant federal tax payments were made in the current period.\n\nThe Group continued to make significant payments into some of the UK defined benefit pension schemes. These payments have further reduced the overall cash tax paid in the UK.\n\n## Group's total tax contribution\n\nThe total amount of taxes we pay and collect globally year-on-year is significantly more than just the tax which we pay on our global profits. To provide a full picture, we have disclosed the Group's global total tax contribution which includes contributions from both continuing and discontinued businesses.\n\n## Group's total tax contribution 2021/22 (taxes paid/collected)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2021/22          | Tax contribution                               | Tax contribution   | Tax contribution       | Tax contribution    | Tax contribution           |                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Tax jurisdiction | Income  tax paid/ (repaid) on  cash basis 1 \u00a3m | Property  taxes \u00a3m | Other  taxes  borne \u00a3m | Taxes  collected \u00a3m | Total tax  contribution \u00a3m | Number of  employees 2 as at  31 March  2022 |\n| United Kingdom   | 315                                            | 302                | 114                    | 1,110               | 1,841                      | 13,424                                       |\n| United States    | 16                                             | 889                | 328                    | 645                 | 1,878                      | 17,332                                       |\n| Ireland          | -                                              | -                  | -                      | -                   | -                          | -                                            |\n| Isle of Man      | -                                              | -                  | -                      | -                   | -                          | -                                            |\n| Luxembourg       | -                                              | -                  | -                      | -                   | -                          | -                                            |\n| Netherlands      | -                                              | -                  | -                      | -                   | -                          | -                                            |\n| Total            | 331                                            | 1,191              | 442                    | 1,755               | 3,719                      | 30,756                                       |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "For 2021/22, our total tax contribution globally was \u00a33,719 million (2020/21: \u00a32,839 million), taxes borne were \u00a31,964 million (2020/21: \u00a31,565 million) and taxes collected were \u00a31,755 million (2020/21: \u00a31,274 million). Our taxes borne have increased in the year primarily due to higher income taxes paid. Taxes collected have increased as a result of higher indirect taxes.\n\nApproximately two thirds of the tax borne by the Group continues to be in relation to property taxes, of which \u00a3889 million are paid in the US across over 1,100 cities and towns in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. These taxes are the municipalities' principal source of revenue to fund school districts, police and fire departments, road construction and other local services.\n\nIn the UK, we participate in the 100 Group's Total Tax Contribution Survey. The survey ranks the UK's biggest listed companies in terms of their contribution to the total UK government's tax receipts. The most recent results of the survey for 2020/21 ranks National Grid as the 19th highest contributor of UK taxes (2019/20: 19th), the 15th highest in respect of taxes borne (2019/20: 11th) and the 3rd highest in respect of capital expenditure (\u00a31,594 million; 2019/20: \u00a31,663 million) on fixed assets (2019/20: 6th). Our ranking in the survey is proportionate to the size of our business and capitalisation relative to the other contributors to the survey.\n\nHowever, National Grid's contribution to the UK and US economies is broader than just the taxes it pays over to and collects on behalf of the tax authorities.\n\nBoth in the UK and the US we employ thousands of individuals directly. We also support jobs in the construction industry through our capital expenditure, which in 2021/22 was \u00a36,446 million, as well as supporting a significant number of jobs in our supply chain.\n\nFurthermore, as a utility we provide a core essential service which allows the infrastructure of the country/states we operate in to run smoothly. This enables individuals and businesses to flourish and contribute to the economy and society.\n\n## Development of future tax policy\n\nWe believe that the continued development of a coherent and transparent tax policy across the Group is critical to help drive growth in the economy.\n\nWe continue to engage on consultations with policymakers where the subject matter impacts taxes borne or collected by our business, with the aim of openly contributing to the debate and development of tax legislation for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n\nTo ensure that the needs of our stakeholders are considered in the development of tax policy we are a member of a number of industry groups which participate in the development of future tax policy, such as the Electricity Tax Forum and CBI Employment Taxes Working Group, together with the 100 Group in the UK, which represents the views of Finance Directors of FTSE 100 companies and several other large UK companies. We undertake similar activities in the US, where the Group is an active member in the Edison Electric Institute, the American Gas Association, the Global Business Alliance, the American Clean Power Association, the Energy Storage Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association.\n\nFeedback from these groups, such as the results of the 100 Group Total Tax Contribution Survey, and consideration of third party reporting frameworks like the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) helps to ensure that we consider the needs of our stakeholders and are engaged at the earliest opportunity on tax issues which affect our business.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn 2021/22, defined benefits pensions and other post-retirement benefits operating costs increased to \u00a3321 million (2020/21: \u00a3302 million) with \u00a366 million related to an increase from the acquisition of WPD in 2021/22.\n\nDuring the year, our pensions and other post-retirement benefit plans improved from a net surplus position of \u00a3715 million at 31 March 2021 to a net surplus of \u00a33,075 million at 31 March 2022. This was principally the result of actuarial gains on plan assets of \u00a30.8 billion (as a result of higher investment returns) and actuarial gains on plan liabilities of \u00a31.6 billion (reflecting higher discount rates from corporate bond yields net of higher expectations for long-term RPI inflation). The acquisition of WPD in June 2021 increased the Group's net pension surplus by \u00a3566 million, but this was offset by the reclassification of National Grid Gas plc's section of the NGUKPS (\u00a3664 million in surplus) at 31 March 2022 to held for sale. Employer contributions during the year were \u00a3300 million (2020/21: \u00a3274 million), including \u00a384 million (2020/21: \u00a388 million) of deficit contributions. As at 31 March 2022, the total UK and US assets and liabilities and the overall net IAS 19 (revised) accounting surplus (2020/21: surplus) is shown below. Further information can be found in note 25 to the financial statements.\n\n## Net pension and other post-retirement obligations\n\n|                       | UK       | US      | Total    |\n|-----------------------|----------|---------|----------|\n| Plan assets (\u00a3m)      | 16,865   | 10,148  | 27,013   |\n| Plan liabilities (\u00a3m) | (14,275) | (9,663) | (23,938) |\n| Net surplus (\u00a3m)      | 2,590    | 485     | 3,075    |\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, we recognised in the statement of financial position pension assets of \u00a33,885 million (UK pensions \u00a32,668 million; US pensions \u00a3732 million; and US other \u00a3485 million) and pensions liabilities of \u00a3810 million (UK pensions \u00a378 million; US pensions \u00a3248 million; and US other \u00a3484 million).\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board has recommended an increase in the final dividend to 33.76p per ordinary share ($2.0929 per American Depository Share), which will be paid on 17 August 2022 to shareholders on the register of members as at 6 June 2022. If approved, this will bring the full-year dividend to 50.97p per ordinary share, an increase of 3.7% over the 49.16p per ordinary share in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2021. This is in line with the increase in average UK CPIH inflation for the year ended 31 March 2022 as set out in our dividend policy. Our aim is to grow the annual dividend in line with CPIH, thus maintaining the dividend per share in real terms. The Board will review this policy regularly, taking into account a range of factors including expected business performance and regulatory developments.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, National Grid plc had \u00a312 billion of distributable reserves, which is sufficient to cover more than five years of forecast Group dividends. If approved, the final dividend will absorb approximately \u00a31.2 billion of shareholders' funds. This year's dividend is covered approximately 1.3x by underlying earnings.\n\nThe Directors consider the Group's capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year when proposing an interim and final dividend and aim to maintain distributable reserves that provide adequate cover for dividend payments.\n\n## New accounting standards\n\nWe did not adopt any new accounting standards in 2021/22. Amendments to certain existing accounting standards were adopted during the year, but these had no material impact on the Group's results or financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nOn 6 April 2022, the UK government announced that ESO will become part of an independent system operator public body, following the Future System Operator consultation. On 11 May 2022, Ofgem approved the Group's request to return \u00a3200 million of interconnector revenues subject to the cap and floor regime to consumers ahead of schedule.

We have maintained our focus on safety, customers, reliability and/uni00A0innovation to continue driving forward the net zero agenda.\n\nWe submitted a technical appeal to the CMA regarding the RIIO-T2 cost of equity and outperformance wedge. The CMA found in our/uni00A0favour on the outperformance wedge, which/uni00A0has since been dropped from the RIIO-T2/uni00A0regulatory framework.\n\nWe have installed 53 T-pylons as part of the route connecting Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to over 6 million homes and businesses. We/uni00A0have completed almost 6.2 miles (10/uni00A0kilometres) of underground tunnelling as part of our London Power Tunnels (LPT2) project and met 100% of our/uni00A0milestones.\n\n## Enable the energy transition for/uni00A0all\n\nWe outperformed this year's proportion of our SF6 Science Based Targets to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030 through a programme of targeted repair, refurbishment and asset replacement. We have been collaborating with suppliers, universities and innovators across the world to trial SF6-free assets. We have switched 10% of our operational fleet to electric as part of the process of going fully electric by 2030.\n\nWe connected over 5 GW of generation to the network as part of our commitment to connect over 15 GW of customer capacity over RIIO-T2 to/uni00A0provide the UK with clean power and flexible/uni00A0storage.\n\nDespite a quadrupling of new connection requests, our teams achieved a Quality of Connection (customer satisfaction) score of/uni00A07.8/uni00A0in 2021/22.\n\n## Deliver for our customers/uni00A0efficiently\n\nOver the year, we have replaced over 900 assets to maintain a safe and reliable network. The network stood up well against the recent storms and although we experienced multiple circuit trips, the majority were returned via the automatic protection Delayed Auto Reclose (DAR) system. No loss of demand occurred through any of the storms, with only 27 MW of Energy Not Supplied against our incentive target of 103 MW.\n\nWestern Link delivers green energy to where it is/uni00A0needed and enables a more efficient electricity system. Due to delays with the complex construction phase, the joint venture agreed to a/uni00A0\u00a315 million payment into Ofgem's redress fund (NGET's share was \u00a310 million) and to return \u00a3143 million to consumers in payments through mechanisms outlined in the price control. This has ensured ET did not benefit from the delay.\n\nWe have delivered \u00a324 million efficiencies with our Evolution programme.\n\n## Grow our organisational capability\n\nThe introduction of SmartWires provides greater control and flexibility of the power flow across our transmission boundaries and the installation of Connectnow is the first Digital Transmission Owner portal in the UK, allowing our customers to understand where to connect and to manage their project portfolios.\n\nOur Deeside Innovation Centre is now operational and enabling the trialling of innovative energy solutions. This will accelerate the deployment of/uni00A0new technologies to facilitate net zero and reduce the cost of maintaining and managing the network.\n\n## Empower colleagues for/uni00A0great/uni00A0performance\n\nIt is over 12 months since any of our 2,500 field and office-based employees suffered an LTI. However, we are disappointed that the frequency of LTIs amongst our contractors has increased above our 0.1 target following 18 contractor LTIs in the year. We are actively working with our contractors to eliminate this gap by ensuring requirements are clear and consistent across all/uni00A0parties.\n\nWe are digitalising our operations in order to better enable our people; for example, our Agile Field Force programme has freed up 20,000 hours of engineer time every year. This enables engineers to focus on using their core skills to maintain and install new/uni00A0assets.\n\nThe first of 53 T-pylons, erected in September 2021 as/uni00A0part of the Hinkley Connection project in the UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn order to migrate to a cleaner energy system, we need to connect increasing amounts of renewable energy from the North Sea and the UK's East Coast. The complexity and scale of the infrastructure investments associated with our East Coast programme will require us to make a step change in how/uni00A0we work with developers, suppliers, environmental groups and local communities so we can find the best local and environmental solutions possible.\n\nWe will reform the customer connections process to be more efficient, connecting our customers more quickly and making full use of the data and products available to drive transparency. We will release capacity for our teams through reduced admin time, using standardisation and by enabling customers to self-serve to ensure all our work adds value.",

We have continued to outperform our targets for/uni00A0customer minutes lost and customer interruptions by 30% and 27% respectively from/uni00A0the underlying performance benchmark, accident rates have reduced to 0.62 accidents per 100 staff, and our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (excluding losses) have continued to get smaller with a 52% reduction since 2014/15. We have also supported almost 26,000 fuel poor customers, leading to estimated annual savings of \u00a314.6 million for/uni00A0these customers.\n\nOur hard work in conducting our business with the highest standards is reflected in WPD winning the Disruptor Award at the Utility Week Awards for our Flexible Power initiative.\n\n## Enable the energy transition for/uni00A0all\n\nWe have several innovative delivery projects underway to drive a fair energy transition for/uni00A0all. In RIIO-ED2, we will build on these foundations to ensure customers are able to/uni00A0connect low-carbon technologies (LCTs) quickly and easily. We have centralised our process for domestic LCTs, offering a next day approval for/uni00A0most EVs and heat pumps.\n\nOur RIIO-ED2 Business Plan includes core commitments which are targets to ensuring that vulnerable customers do not miss the benefits associated with the shift to a smart energy system. This includes offering 600,000 Priority Service Register (PSR) customers a bespoke smart energy action plan, supporting local communities via a Community Matters social initiative and installing solar PV on schools in areas of high economic deprivation.\n\nIn May 2022, Ofgem announced that WPD had agreed to pay \u00a33.7 million for each of the four licences we operate, totalling \u00a314.9 million. This followed the outcome of an investigation into the level of information, advice and services provided to customers on the PSR. We have made changes to our policies and processes to ensure we are fully complying with the expectations Ofgem has clarified in our licence.\n\n## Deliver for our customers/uni00A0efficiently\n\nEven though we had to change some practices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to provide the highest level of service to our 8 million customers. Our hard work is reflected in/uni00A0our excellent performance against the Broad Measure of Customer Satisfaction (BMCS) results, scoring 9.03/uni00A0out of 10 overall.\n\n## Grow our organisational capability\n\nWe have established plans and work programmes to build a 'green recovery' from the/uni00A0effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The nationwide call for evidence to support network investment projects saw WPD receive feedback from more than 200/uni00A0stakeholders, and this helped us target the network investment to the areas that see the most benefit. All 73 projects have been given the/uni00A0go-ahead, each meeting the Ofgem-backed initiative's criteria of enabling net zero and providing a wider social benefit. The successful projects, which will be completed in the next two years, range from installing new substations to reinforcing existing parts of the network. In total, 55% of the projects relate to/uni00A0customers wanting to connect public EV charging hubs in some form and we estimate that customers could connect up to 50% more ultra-rapid EV chargers because of/uni00A0these investments, many at motorway service/uni00A0areas.\n\n## Empower colleagues for/uni00A0great/uni00A0performance\n\nDuring the year, the WPD Chief Executive met up with small groups of colleagues to hear/uni00A0their views on WPD. The sessions were attended by colleagues across various roles and encouraged suggestions to be brought forward to drive an/uni00A0overall performance improvement within the/uni00A0organisation. This direct feedback from colleagues will be crucial in producing ideas, innovations and solutions to the many challenges and opportunities that we will have/uni00A0in/uni00A0the business going forward.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe are determined to achieve a sustainable energy future by delivering a dynamic, innovative/uni00A0and high-functioning energy grid that/uni00A0stands ready to serve many generations to/uni00A0come. Change is already well underway, with unprecedented levels of flexibility and efficiency, and new distribution system operator capabilities already in place. In RIIO-ED2, we will accelerate the rate of this change, placing customers at the heart of/uni00A0a/uni00A0swift and effective transition to a/uni00A0smart,/uni00A0decarbonised energy future.\n\nWorks to improve the overhead network in/uni00A0Droitwich, North Worcestershire, UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will utilise innovative and digitalised solutions to enhance our operations. We will/uni00A0instil a culture across our business that maximises every opportunity to innovate and work smarter for our customers. We have embedded \u00a3723 million of efficiency savings into our RIIO-ED2 Business Plan thanks to/uni00A0our proven track record of innovation development and roll-out. Without this, required investment in RIIO-ED2 would have been \u00a37.4 billion, which would have resulted in increases to customer bills. Instead, by working smarter and embracing a/uni00A0culture of/uni00A0continual innovation, we will deliver our RIIO-ED2 commitments with a/uni00A0budget of \u00a36.7 billion whilst maintaining affordability for/uni00A0our customers.\n\nIn addition, we will deliver an extra \u00a395 million of efficiency savings over RIIO-ED2. We anticipate a 108% increase in the level of load-related schemes, with only an 8% increase in engineering management and support costs. By adopting a 'flexibility first' approach to all load-related investment decisions, we have committed that by 2028 we will avoid over \u00a394 million of network reinforcement costs by/uni00A0operating the existing/uni00A0primary and secondary networks more flexibly.",

There was a continued focus on/uni00A0safety, storm response and the clean energy transition.\n\n## Highlights\n\nWe used lessons learnt throughout the pandemic to help navigate the ever-changing COVID-19 protocols in the region. Colleagues continued to work safely, whether in the field or/uni00A0utilising our hybrid or remote work model. In/uni00A0addition, we found ways to give back and support the communities we serve by assisting/uni00A0with COVID-19 vaccinations and donating hygienic safety products to nonprofit/uni00A0organisations.\n\nNew England faced several challenging storms this fiscal year. Our field crews and emergency response organisation conducted thorough emergency planning and collaborations across divisions, which resulted in our crews safely and efficiently restoring power to our customers. Our restoration efforts were recognised once again as we were awarded EEI Emergency Response Awards for both Tropical Storm Henri and the October Nor'easter.\n\nSafety is a pillar of our daily operations, and we continue to focus on the wellbeing and safety of/uni00A0our workforce and customers alike. We have improved our safety score for near misses and good catches and, as at 31 March 2022, our LTIFR was 0.18.\n\n## Enable the energy transition for all\n\nIn 2021, we worked with the City of Melrose to/uni00A0deploy 15 pole-mounted EV chargers to expand EV adoption, accelerate usage and lower installation costs. This project is the first deployment of elevated, pole-mounted EV chargers by an investor-owned utility in the US.\n\nWe have focused on advancing clean transportation by working with cities such as/uni00A0Beverly on an electric school bus project, incorporating a fully electric-powered backhoe into our fleet, and proposing our largest ever/uni00A0EV programme with Massachusetts regulators.\n\nThe Company also continued to reduce methane/uni00A0emissions from our gas network. We/uni00A0replaced over 170 miles (274 kilometres) of/uni00A0leak-prone gas pipes across New England, improving pipeline safety and reducing greenhouse gas/uni00A0emissions.\n\nIn March 2022, as part of the DPU 20-80 proceeding, we and our fellow Massachusetts gas utilities filed a plan with the Department of Public Utilities that outlines exactly how to get to a decarbonised heating future. We believe our approach will most effectively balance\n\naffordability and equity, safety, reliability, and resilience. Our plan strives to retain customer choice around heating solutions, reduce overall energy costs, increase investment and adoption of energy-efficiency measures, and make provisions for utilising non-pipe alternatives where safe and cost effective.\n\n## Deliver for our customers efficiently\n\nWe aim to provide a fairer, cleaner and more affordable gas service to our customers. The Department of Public Utilities approved our five-year rate plan on 1 October 2021. The plan/uni00A0supports capital investment and provides resources to meet our work plans over the next five years.\n\nWe also received approval of our geothermal demonstration programme, which secured funding for four district geothermal system installations for existing Massachusetts gas/uni00A0customers.\n\n## Grow our organisational capability\n\nIn July 2021, the Company's Massachusetts Phase 3 Electric Vehicle proposal was filed with the DPU to build upon our first two Electric Vehicle Market Development Programs by providing offerings to meet the diverse transportation needs of all the Company's customers, building the infrastructure required to support state-wide EV adoption, and helping to enable the Commonwealth's broader transition to a clean transportation future. The Company is/uni00A0proposing to run the Phase III Program for a/uni00A0period of four years, with a total budget of approximately $278 million.\n\nIn October 2021, we appointed a New England President to our Group Executive Committee. The Committee's wide range of experience will/uni00A0help lead the clean energy transition for all of/uni00A0our communities.\n\nThe sale of our Rhode Island electricity and gas business will serve as a vital step in furthering our strategic vision. To prepare for the sale, we/uni00A0established a transition team of over 250 people across 19 functional areas to set up both the future Massachusetts and Rhode Island businesses for success. The sale has received all/uni00A0required regulatory approvals, including from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. That decision, however, has been appealed to the RI Superior Court by the RI Attorney General. We are confident that the Division's approval of the sale will be upheld and/uni00A0look forward to closing the transaction as/uni00A0expeditiously as/uni00A0possible.\n\nBoston Common Park, Massachusetts, US\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Empower colleagues for/uni00A0great/uni00A0performance\n\nOur colleagues worked to create an equitable impact in our communities. The New England Gas Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Council is a grassroots group of both union and management field employees. The group recently launched two initiatives to recruit and/uni00A0retain employees from diverse backgrounds, including hosting a pipeline career development day at local high schools. By/uni00A0investing in our communities through education and upskilling talent to adapt to the changing energy system, we are/uni00A0tackling our DEI commitments.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nCustomers are always at the forefront of everything we do, and we must consistently deliver a safe and reliable service.

Throughout the various organisational model changes, severe weather events, rate cases and public opposition in our region, we prioritised safety, bold clean energy and climate action plans, and our commitment to the communities we serve.\n\n## Highlights\n\nNew York encountered several challenging storms, but we remained focused on emergency planning and restoration efforts. This year we received an EEI Emergency Response Award and the 2021 ReliabilityOne \u00ae Award for Outstanding Suburban and Rural Service Area Utility in the Northeast as/uni00A0we hit our regulated reliability goals for the 14th consecutive year.\n\nSafety remained one of our top priorities in the/uni00A0region. We continued to use the tools and/uni00A0processes developed at the onset of the pandemic to safely navigate through the various spikes in COVID-19. We have improved our safety score for near misses and good catches, and as at 31 March 2022, our/uni00A0LTIFR was 0.13.\n\n## Enable the energy transition for all\n\nIn New York, we are doing our part to fulfil the clean energy transition. In 2021, we worked with/uni00A0the town of Hempstead, New York, and introduced one of the country's first and largest clean hydrogen demonstration projects. The HyGrid Project located in Point Lookout on Long Island will blend green hydrogen into the existing distribution system to heat approximately 800 homes and fuel a fleet of municipal vehicles.\n\nWe are also working with the New York Power Authority to build the Smart Path Connect project, a $1 billion transmission upgrade that will enable the integration of 1 GW of renewable energy to the grid. In addition, we have proposed nearly $700 million in short-term transmission upgrades in upstate New York that/uni00A0would unlock roughly 2.6 GW of clean energy resources.\n\nThe solid rate case agreements that have been completed for KEDNY, KEDLI and NMPC are essential steps in energy transition. These rate agreements will provide us with the funding needed to create the energy infrastructure and/uni00A0service our New York customers demand and/uni00A0deserve.\n\n## Deliver for our customers efficiently\n\nIn New York, we are serving our customers and communities through our new initiative, Project C. Project C focuses on/uni00A0four key priorities: clean/uni00A0energy and sustainability; workforce development; neighbourhood investment and community engagement; and environmental justice and social equity. By providing grants to non-profits, recreational programmes, and local economic development partners, we will support the revitalisation of communities and small businesses across our service area.\n\nWith the cost of heating increasing this past winter, we collaborated with AARP New York and the Public Utility Law Project (PULP) to make income-eligible customers aware of our Energy Affordability Programme (EAP). Our Consumer Advocates helped seniors with enrolment in EAP and provided information on/uni00A0other no-cost, energy-saving programmes to/uni00A0improve the comfort of their homes.\n\n## Grow our organisational capability\n\nWe play a key role in combatting climate change and providing climate solutions. As part of the lead-up to COP26, we joined forces with government leaders from around the world at Climate Week NYC, where we were the headline partner, to focus on fulfilling and increasing commitments to climate action. Several National Grid leaders contributed to the global conversation on climate change and how to take action.\n\nAnother significant highlight in our region was/uni00A0bringing 900 of our Long Island gas field employees through a gas business enablement go-live. We successfully provided colleagues with tools and applications to meet the needs of/uni00A0our customers, communities and regulators.\n\n## Empower colleagues for great/uni00A0performance\n\nAfter nearly three years of planning, our new Brooklyn, New York office at 2 Hanson Place opened in 2021. This highly anticipated space was built on the Smart workspace strategy, and/uni00A0we ensured it incorporated principles of/uni00A0sustainability and human wellbeing in its design and operations. The building was also designed to WELL and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design building standards, which resulted in an Award of Excellence by the New England chapter of/uni00A0CoreNet Global.\n\nView of Albany, New York, US\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe New York team had a good year, and we/uni00A0are excited about what is ahead.

Its portfolio includes electricity interconnectors, LNG storage and/uni00A0regasification, large-scale renewable generation, conventional generation and competitive transmission. Other activities primarily relate to NGP, the corporate investment and innovation arm of National/uni00A0Grid, as well as UK property, insurance and corporate activities.\n\nDespite ongoing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US and UK, NGV businesses performed well in 2021/22, including commissioning the North Sea Link interconnector between the UK and Norway and the Prairie Wolf Solar Project in Illinois. NGV also successfully secured a seabed lease in the New/uni00A0York Bight offshore auction together with RWE Renewables. In March 2022, National Grid Property completed the sale of National Grid's 50% interest in the St/uni00A0William Homes LLP joint venture to The Berkeley Group plc.\n\nThe safety and wellbeing of colleagues continues to be a key priority across NGV. As at 31 March 2022, NGV's LTIFR was 0.14.\n\n## Enable the energy transition for all\n\nNGV plays an important role for the National Grid Group in developing, constructing, operating and investing in infrastructure to support the energy transition and security of supply in both the UK and the US.\n\nIn the UK, NGV is the leading developer and operator of interconnectors, which are highvoltage subsea cables that enable the UK to share excess power, such as wind, solar and hydro generation, with neighbouring markets.\n\nIn/uni00A0October 2021, NGV commissioned North Sea Link, which at 447 miles (720 kilometres) is the world's longest subsea interconnector. NGV also/uni00A0operates links to Belgium, France and the Netherlands. By 2030, we estimate that 90% of the energy imported by NGV interconnectors will be from zero-carbon energy sources.\n\n## NGV is part of the Northern Endurance\n\nPartnership, a consortium developing CO2 transport and storage technology for the East Coast Cluster (ECC) in the North of England. The ECC, which aims to transport carbon emissions from the Humber and Teesside for safe storage deep under the Southern North Sea, is one of two industrial clusters selected by the UK government to be delivered this decade.\n\nOfgem has agreed to National Grid's offer to make an early payment of \u00a3200 million of interconnector revenues to consumers, via the regulator, as part of the interconnector regulatory regime. The payments will be made over the next two years, to help reduce consumer energy bills.\n\nIn the US, NGV and RWE Renewables successfully secured a seabed lease as part of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's New York Bight auction. Community Offshore Wind, a/uni00A0joint venture between the two companies, will develop the awarded seabed, which has the potential to host 3/uni00A0GW of/uni00A0capacity. NGV's National Grid Renewables business started commercial operations of its 200 MW Prairie Wolf Solar Project in Illinois and began construction on 674 MW of solar and energy storage projects in Texas and Ohio.\n\nNGV is part owner of New York Transco, which started construction of the largest transmission project in New York in 40 years to enable 1 GW of renewable energy onto the system.\n\nNGP had a portfolio which comprised 38 companies and four fund investments at a fair value of $491 million, as at 31 March 2022.\n\n## Deliver for our customers/uni00A0efficiently\n\nIn the UK, NGV's interconnector portfolio comprises 6.4 GW of operational capacity. Together with France's R\u00e9seau de Transport d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (RTE), NGV operates the IFA and IFA2 interconnectors connecting France and Great Britain. IFA, a 2 GW HVDC cable, suffered a major fire in September 2021. Half of the link, representing 1 GW, was safely returned to service the following month. The remaining 1/uni00A0GW is expected to return to service in December 2022. IFA2 is a 1 GW cable stretching 149 miles (240 kilometres). BritNed is an independent joint venture between National Grid and TenneT, the Dutch transmission system operator. It owns and operates a 1 GW HVDC link between Great Britain and the Netherlands. Nemo Link is an independent joint venture between National Grid and Elia, the Belgian transmission system operator. It owns and operates a 1 GW HVDC link between Great/uni00A0Britain and Belgium.\n\nNGV's Grain LNG is one of three LNG importation facilities in the UK. It operates under long-term take or pay contracts with customers and provides importation services of ship berthing, temporary storage, ship reloading and regasification into the National Transmission System (NTS). Grain LNG's road tanker loading facility also offers the UK's transport and off-grid industrial sector a more environmentally friendly alternative to diesel or heavy fuel oil. The facility allows tanker operators to load and transport LNG in bulk across the UK via road or rail.\n\nNGV is a part owner of Millennium Pipeline, which provides consumers in the northeastern US with additional natural gas infrastructure to meet growing consumer demand for cleaner and more reliable energy. It is strategically positioned to serve utility and power plant loads across New York State and into New England.\n\nInside the UK valve hall at NGV's 1GW IFA2/uni00A0interconnector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grow our organisational capability\n\nNGV established a portfolio management function to optimise the existing portfolio and identify future opportunities for growth.\n\n## Empower colleagues for/uni00A0great/uni00A0performance\n\nNGV prides itself on a diverse and inclusive culture, which includes 46% diversity across new hires in 2021/22.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIn the UK, NGV will grow its interconnector portfolio by 1.4 GW in the next two years, with construction underway on the Viking Link interconnector. Developed together with/uni00A0Danish transmission system operator Energinet, Viking Link will be a 475 mile (765/uni00A0kilometre) long subsea link connecting Great Britain and Denmark. NGV will have 7.8/uni00A0GW of operational interconnector capacity when Viking Link becomes operational in 2023/24. Work is also underway to expand Grain LNG's storage capacity from 1.0 million m\u00b3 to 1.2 million m\u00b3 by 2025, further supporting the UK's gas security of supply.",

Examples of how the Directors have had regard to these matters during the year are set out on/uni00A0pages 56 - 59, which together form our section 172(1) statement.\n\nThe Board recognises its responsibilities to each of National Grid's stakeholder groups and to wider society. The Directors endeavour to ascertain the interests and views of our stakeholders and consider these when taking decisions.\n\nThe Board oversees a governance framework that enables decisions to be taken at the right time in the most appropriate forum. We recognise that it is not always possible to achieve each stakeholder's preferred outcome and consideration of each stakeholder group depends on the matter at hand. The Board strives to balance the different priorities and interests of our stakeholders in a way compatible with the long-term, sustainable success of the business and which maintains a standard of/uni00A0business conduct aligned to our values and purpose.\n\n## Our approach to stakeholder engagement\n\nMost engagement with key stakeholders is carried out by management teams and takes place at business level and the Directors engage directly with stakeholders where possible. Reporting mechanisms are/uni00A0in/uni00A0place to/uni00A0collate feedback and developments from such engagement and enable a flow of this information to the Board and Board Committees, to/uni00A0inform decision/uni00A0making.\n\nAn overview of business-level engagement and outcomes is reported to/uni00A0the Board or appropriate Board Committee on a regular basis. The/uni00A0cadence and content of such reports to the Board are considered bi-annually as part of the forward business review by the Chair, Chief Executive and Group General Counsel & Company Secretary, to ensure sufficient consideration is given to pertinent matters and affected stakeholders. One of the Board's objectives is to routinely bring external viewpoints into Board discussions, which have included external speakers, training sessions and organisational deep dives led by colleagues from across the business, during the year.\n\nThe Board has identified the stakeholder groups it considers key and some examples of how we have engaged with these groups, together with the outcomes and impacts of engagement on our business and Board decisions, are set out on pages 57 - 58. These examples are not exhaustive and we have integrated reporting on how stakeholder views are considered throughout this report.

Following extensive oversight by the Board of the investigation into a catastrophic fire at/uni00A0the IFA interconnector site in Sellindge during 2021, three Non-executive Directors visited the site in March 2022. They met with a/uni00A0range of workers on site and heard views on safety practices.\n\nThe annual Grid:voice engagement survey provides insights into what is important to our colleagues and how they are feeling about the Company's strategy and leadership. The results of this survey were provided to the Board and plans put in place to/uni00A0progress any/uni00A0areas of improvement identified. Further information about the/uni00A0Board's employee engagement programme is set out on pages/uni00A096/uni00A0- 97.\n\n## Stakeholder group - Our customers\n\n## How we engaged\n\nBi-annual updates are provided to the Board on UK, US and NGV customers, including progress on deliverables linked to our strategic priorities.\n\nAs recommended by the NY Monitor, the Company produced a/uni00A0supplementary report to its Natural Gas Long-Term Capacity Report for Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island (published in 2020), which analysed gas supply constraints in downstate NY and identified options for meeting future demand. The supplementary report was based on the results of an extensive outreach programme to measure customer and other stakeholder support for the various supply options for future demand. Engagement occurred through multiple channels, including social media and web platforms. Regular reports and analysis were provided to the Board to inform strategy development in this area.\n\nWPD has an established customer panel that meets quarterly, with members who represent a wide range of customers and other key stakeholder groups. This enduring, expert engagement plays an important role in challenging our approaches, helping WPD achieve its purpose of/uni00A0delivering good value and high-quality services for its/uni00A0customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nAn independent investor-perception study following the Investor Day found the Company's critical role at the heart of the energy transition was well understood and there was a high degree of trust that the Company will fulfil this role successfully. The need to maintain the momentum to integrate our ESG reporting and talk more about future opportunities for the network, particularly in the US, was highlighted. Responses have informed our ongoing investor relations communication strategy and we will address key themes at investor events throughout 2022.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the Board proposed, and shareholders approved, an amendment to Company's Articles of Association to enable the holding of hybrid AGMs. This flexibility will enable more of our shareholders to participate in future AGMs, using online facilities. We/uni00A0intend to hold a/uni00A0hybrid AGM for the first time in 2022.\n\nOur unique investment proposition is set out on pages 8 - 9.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nFeedback from our annual Grid:voice survey has led to development of our home-working IT capabilities and of our flexible working policy, following a strong indication of a preference among the workforce to continue with hybrid ways of working.\n\nSpecific indicators are used as a measure of culture in relation to employee perception of safety and leadership. You can learn about how the Board oversees corporate culture and the progress we are making on these indices on page 95.\n\nEmployee engagement and workforce diversity are two of our non-financial KPIs. Further information is on page 27.\n\nRead about our commitments to our colleagues and how we are living our corporate values on pages 65 - 66.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nThe Board spent considerable time discussing the customer viewpoints presented as part of the downstate New York supply analysis together with the report's findings and consideration of the/uni00A0robustness of the report's methodology.\n\nThe Board noted the impact of adverse weather conditions on customers across the network during 2021 and early 2022. Several storms in the UK and the US caused power outages in a number of/uni00A0areas. The Company was able to provide a strong operational response to Storm Henri in New England, due largely to the Company's investment in Rhode Island infrastructure over the past five years. You can read more about our storm response on page 19, in our business unit updates on pages 50 - 55, and in our Safety & Sustainability Committee report on page/uni00A0106.\n\nTo address the challenges of engaging with end customers, who often have little prior knowledge of WPD, an enduring cohort of 96 customers have undergone a programme of research and focus groups over several months, enriching their understanding and ability to offer informed scrutiny of our plans.",

Additional information about specific challenges as they arise, such as those presented by the heightened energy prices in the UK and the related security of supply are included in management reports to/uni00A0the Board to inform discussions.\n\nIn January 2022, the Safety & Sustainability Committee welcomed external speakers from Quanta Services Inc., a major supplier of/uni00A0infrastructure services to the Group in the US.\n\nThe Board receives an annual update on the approach taken to address modern slavery risks across our supply chain and the proposed commitments for the following year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nWe strive to work only with businesses that adhere to our Code of Conduct and continue to work closely with our suppliers and peers to share and build upon existing knowledge and promote best practices within the industry.\n\nWe have worked with Ofgem via the ENA with WPD participation in working groups to facilitate the recovery of Supplier of Last Resort (SoLR) costs for suppliers.\n\nIn response to developments in the UK gas and energy markets, we established an organisation-level Energy Market Risk Committee to monitor and consolidate the risks and impacts of the current market for reporting to the Board.\n\nThe Board considers and approves the Company's Modern Slavery/uni00A0Statement annually. This statement is available at nationalgrid.com/modern-slavery-statement .\n\n## Stakeholder group - Communities, governments and environment\n\n## How we engaged\n\nWe were a principal partner at COP26 in 2021. The Company hosted a number of sessions and events, including the Chief Executive co-hosting the launch of the Green Grids Initiative with the/uni00A0UK government.\n\nOne of the Board's aims is to provide positive advocacy for key public policy and regulatory changes in support of net zero. The Chief Executive and other members of senior leadership have met directly with members of the UK and US governments during the year as part of the Company's ESG outreach to highlight our continuing efforts towards a clean energy transition.\n\nIn response to the situation in Ukraine, the business has established a Crisis Assessment Team to assess the situation on an ongoing basis and additional Board reporting has been implemented to ensure prompt information flows. The Board advises as to actions that may be undertaken quickly, where appropriate.\n\n## Stakeholder group - Our regulators\n\n## How we engaged\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from the business on regulatory/uni00A0matters.\n\nThe NY Monitor attended the Company's Board meeting in June/uni00A02021 to engage in discussion with the Directors about the Company's supplementary report to its Natural Gas Long-Term Capacity Report for Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island (published in 2020). The session covered the culture of the Company's US business, issues of supply and demand in New York and the need for third-party and regulatory support for innovative change. There was a/uni00A0second meeting with the NY Monitor in September 2021, hosted by a/uni00A0subset of the Directors.\n\nThe Company seeks to maintain a collaborative relationship with all/uni00A0its/uni00A0regulators. The Board met with Ofgem senior leadership in March 2022.\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nAs part of enabling the energy transition for all, the US business established independent New York and New England Advisory Boards to provide objective input and external expertise to US senior leaders. The boards will enable the Company to build on existing relationships while creating new relationships, and advance the Company's profile as a socially responsible and purpose-led organisation among our stakeholders in the US.\n\nThe Company was invited and agreed to participate in the Green Grids Initiative's UK secretariat after COP26. Further information on/uni00A0this and our other COP26 activities is on pages 16, 17 and 69.\n\nWPD was the first DNO to develop a Social Contract as a vehicle for/uni00A0delivering social and environmental value for our employees, customers and wider society. Co-created with stakeholders, the Social Contract sets out our ambitions to maximise the positive impact of what we do.\n\nRead about our community programmes on page 62.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcomes and actions\n\nDuring the year, US regulatory matters, the RIIO-ED2 regulatory consultation and our engagement with Ofgem have been considered in depth by the Board. The Board discussed the complexity of the downstate New York supply challenges and confirmed that this would continue to form part of the Board's agenda in 2022.\n\nThe Board noted the Company's engagement with Ofgem on changes to SoLR rules which will improve the viability of suppliers to/uni00A0retail customers.\n\nAs we work to drive progress towards net zero and a secure energy future, the Company has, and will continue to, consult extensively with Ofgem and BEIS on development and implementation of the FSO.

The transactions are aligned to our wider ambition to/uni00A0be at the heart of/uni00A0the energy transition. The decision to acquire WPD, the UK's largest electricity distribution business, increases our exposure to electricity, which is expected to see a high level of asset growth as a part of the UK government's plans to decarbonise the energy system.\n\n## Interests of our colleagues\n\nThe Board has considered the impacts of the integration of WPD on existing and incoming employees and of separation on employees of/uni00A0NECO and GT at every stage. This includes the technological and operational aspects of their work environments and continuity of rewards. The Board oversaw an engagement plan for the integration of/uni00A0WPD employees and the Chief Executive toured key WPD sites in September 2021. The CEO of WPD will lead the UK distribution business as part of the enlarged Group.\n\n## Fostering business relationships with suppliers, customers and/uni00A0others\n\nThe Company expects to provide benefits for customers and suppliers as/uni00A0a result of greater interconnectivity of the network following the onboarding of WPD. In conjunction with the NGG Sale, the Company engaged in dialogue with BEIS in relation to the newly implemented National Security and Investment Act 2021 in the UK.\n\nIn March 2021, we announced our plan to reposition our portfolio through three strategic transactions: the acquisition of WPD, and the sale of NECO and of a majority stake in NGG. The Board has spent a significant amount of time during the year overseeing the progress of these transactions and considering the ongoing implications for our business and stakeholders.\n\nA Transaction Steering Committee (chaired by the Chief Executive) and a Transaction Management Office were established to provide executive-level oversight and a layer of governance over the transaction programmes. Regular reports and updates were provided to the Board on progress, including deep dives and the results of ongoing stakeholder engagement to inform decision-making at all stages.\n\nRead more about our strategic portfolio positioning in our Chair's statement and Chief Executive's review on pages 10 - 14 and our strategy and risk management for climate change on page/uni00A074.\n\n## Impact on community and environment\n\nThe Company recognises the importance of WPD to the communities it/uni00A0serves and has announced its intention to maintain the WPD headquarters in Bristol and offices in other key locations. WPD's community programmes have been maintained and are being integrated into the Group's wider projects. The strategic portfolio repositioning is aligned to the Group's wider ESG strategy. For more information see page 74.\n\n## Maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct\n\nThe Board oversees the process for obtaining the appropriate regulatory approvals required for each of the transactions before they are able to complete. Regular updates on progress were provided to the Board.\n\n## Need to act fairly between members\n\nThe Company endeavours to provide investors with clear and transparent reporting on its plans and progress. The Investor Day in 2021 was an opportunity for investors to hear about the Group's fiveyear plan and to ask questions of a broad group of business leaders. The Company maintains an investment grade credit rating supporting its sustainable dividend policy.",

This involves developing infrastructure such as our work in East Anglia and helping consumers use energy more efficiently. Our WhenToPlugIn app in the UK informs consumers when the electricity in their/uni00A0homes is coming from clean and green energy/uni00A0sources.\n\nWe also partner with charity organisations such as Trussell Trust and Red Cross and encourage employees to volunteer in the community. 1,167/uni00A0National Grid employees have registered to volunteer their time to support our Grid for Good/uni00A0programme.\n\nWe invested \u00a318.3 million during 2021/22 to/uni00A0support communities affected by COVID-19 and recent rises in energy prices\n\nWe are investing more in community support for COVID-19 and rising energy/uni00A0prices\n\n## An energy transition for all\n\nThe technological and environmental benefits of/uni00A0the clean energy transition should benefit everyone, and we will play our role in ensuring that no one is left behind.

In the US, we/uni00A0do this through low-income programmes and/uni00A0energy-efficiency programmes. In the UK, in/uni00A02017, we established a \u00a3150 million Warm Homes Fund designed to support local authorities and others in helping approximately 50,000 households suffering from fuel poverty. During 2021/22, this fund has helped the Fuel Bank Foundation to provide crisis support. We are also supporting Citizens Advice in its work to/uni00A0support those struggling with the rising cost of/uni00A0living, including energy bills.\n\nIn 2020, we also launched the Green Light Signal, a smart light bulb that turns green when electricity in your region is more than 50% low carbon. The/uni00A0bulb and new WhenToPlugIn app/uni00A0are designed to engage customers and communities in the transition to low carbon and build understanding of progress.\n\n## Benefiting communities\n\nWe are supporting opportunity and growth in our/uni00A0communities. We launched Grid for Good in 2020 to achieve social mobility for disconnected young people in the communities we serve. This/uni00A0year the programme has supported 3,972 young people, helping to inspire and develop the skills needed for net zero. In the UK, we support communities affected by our infrastructure\n\nprojects, where grants are available for local projects that bring social, economic or environmental benefits. In addition, as part of/uni00A0capital delivery projects, we work with third-party organisations to provide community benefits at scale.\n\nIn the US, we support the National Grid Foundation, a non-profit charitable organisation. The Foundation awards grants to non-profit organisations focused on educational and environmental challenges. The Foundation currently disburses nearly $4 million a year; for/uni00A02021, this was $3.77 million.\n\nIn 2021/22, we launched Project C for our community to promote and develop our community programmes in New York State. Across Massachusetts, New York and Rhode/uni00A0Island, we provided total funding of/uni00A0approximately $12 million a year through centrally-led programmes in support of charitable/uni00A0organisations.\n\nDuring the year, we recorded over 23,416 hours volunteered by our colleagues in support of/uni00A0a/uni00A0variety of causes.

We also require them to adhere to the Principles of the UN Global Compact, the International Labour Organization minimum standards, the Ethical Trading Initiative Base Code and the US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000.\n\nGroup - \u00a36.7 billion (continuing operations)\n\nIn line with our commitment of/uni00A0reinvestment in infrastructure\n\nOn track to deliver our investment in developing technologies and innovations\n\nWe continue to develop our supply chain standards and have committed to at least 75% of our top 250 suppliers to have active carbon reduction targets by 2030\n\nIn the UK, we are an accredited Living Wage Foundation Employer and paying a real living wage is a requirement for all our suppliers based in the UK.\n\nExpanding the diversity of our supplier base is an/uni00A0important part of our procurement strategy. In/uni00A0the US, we partner in a number of programmes including the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce Pacesetters Program and the New York & New Jersey Minority Supplier Development Council. We are also partners in the Ascend Long Island project, providing specialised programmes to promote minority business growth and job opportunities.",

All RBR commitments embedded into business planning and targets\n\nContinually review the Company culture to ensure it is inclusive\n\nCommitment to a Group Executive Committee diversity ratio of 50% and ambition to achieve the same for Board diversity\n\nThe diversity of our Board is now 53.8%, Group Executive Committee diversity is 53.8%, and the diversity of our Senior Leadership Group is 49.5%\n\nWe have made positive progress in achieving diversity at Board level and good progress on diversity at senior leader level\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe prioritise our responsibilities to our different but interrelated stakeholder groups and are careful to ensure we understand the interests of/uni00A0our stakeholders and reflect them in our decisions. Stakeholder engagement plays an/uni00A0important role in how our Board ensures responsibility in governance. This includes listening to our stakeholders' views, inviting external guests to meetings, and using independent research to bring the voice of the/uni00A0customer and other stakeholders into the/uni00A0Boardroom.\n\n## Highest ethical standards - ethical business conduct\n\nWe regard the potential for bribery and corruption as/uni00A0a significant risk to the business and have established policies and governance that set and monitor our approach to preventing financial crimes, fraud, bribery and corruption, including our Code of Ethics (covering anti-bribery and anti-corruption). We have a Company-wide framework of controls designed to prevent and detect bribery.\n\nOur Code sets out the standards and behaviours we expect from all employees to meet our values of 'do the right thing', 'find a better way' and 'make it happen'. Our Group Ethics, Risk and Compliance Committee oversees the Code of Ethics and associated awareness programmes. We issue this Code and operate an e-learning course for all colleagues so they adequately understand our zero-tolerance approach.\n\nWe also have an Anti-Financial Crimes policy that applies to all colleagues and those working on our behalf. It sets out our zero-tolerance approach to bribery, fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and other corrupt business practices. To ensure compliance with the UK Bribery Act 2010 and other relevant legislation,\n\nwe operate an anti-financial crime risk assessment process across the Company and ensure adequate procedures are in place.\n\nAny cases alleging bribery are referred immediately to the relevant ECC so the members can satisfy themselves that cases are managed effectively, including ensuring any lessons learnt are communicated across the business. We investigate all allegations of ethical misconduct thoroughly, take corrective action and share lessons learnt. We also record trends and metrics relating to such allegations.\n\nEach business function is required to consider its/uni00A0specific risks and maintain a compliance framework, setting out the controls it has in place to detect and prevent bribery. Business areas self-assess the effectiveness of controls and provide evidence that supports reported compliance. Each year, all function heads are asked to certify the compliance in their area, and/uni00A0to provide details of any exceptions. This culminates in the presentation of a/uni00A0Certificate of Assurance from the Chief Executive to the Board (following consideration by the Audit & Risk Committee). You can read more about the Audit & Risk Committee's role, including its ongoing assessment of the adequacy of our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies and processes, on pages 101 - 105.\n\nIn New York, we were the victim of criminal activity where former employees circumvented controls to commit fraud in the procurement of DNY Facilities work. We engaged professional consultants to perform a comprehensive review of our control framework. Whilst our procurement controls were found to be effective, we are implementing recommendations to make improvements to our control framework and Ethics and Business Conduct Program.\n\n## Highest ethical standards human/uni00A0rights\n\nRespect for human rights is incorporated into our employment practices, and values, and is integral to our Code of Ethics. This is vital in maintaining our reputation as a company our stakeholders want to do business with, and our employees want to work for.\n\nAlthough we do not have specific policies relating to human rights, slavery or human trafficking, we cover these issues through related policies and procedures such as our approach to diversity, anti-discrimination, privacy, equal opportunity and, in addition, our Global Supplier Code of Conduct integrates human rights into the way we/uni00A0screen and interact with our supply chain.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nWe have a confidential internal helpline, and an external 'Speak-Up' helpline available at all times in all the regions where we operate. We publicise the contact information to our colleagues and on our external website so concerns can be reported anonymously. Our policies make it clear that we will support and protect whistleblowers and not tolerate any form of retaliation.\n\nPurpose has moved to be the most important cultural aspect in our annual leadership culture survey\n\nIn 2021/22 we have moved our governance to better reflect our RBC/uni00A0priorities\n\nIn 2021/22 purpose has moved to be at/uni00A0the heart of how we do business",

It/uni00A0receives a small grant but relies on volunteers and fundraising, so/uni00A0has struggled to cover the costs of animal care and the services it runs during the pandemic.\n\nWorking in teams and encouraged by TV presenter Tommy Walsh a/uni00A0keen supporter of the charity - our leaders transformed a wild stretch of ground into an attractive wooded garden in just a few hours. They cleared weeds, built features to attract bees, insects and pondlife, laid paths, erected raised beds, planted flowers and fruit saplings, and repaired and painted a playhouse.\n\nTheir work leaves a legacy that will make a difference to hundreds of/uni00A0local school children and others in the neighbourhood for years to come. National Grid has committed to continue its support for the charity and provide opportunities for colleagues to return to undertake further work.\n\n## Engaging our colleagues\n\nWe rely on our colleagues to achieve success for/uni00A0the business. We aim to attract and/uni00A0retain the best people by striving to be recognised as an employer of choice that values/uni00A0diversity.\n\nWe work towards going beyond the main aspects of the employer-employee relationship, to create a culture focused on the value we can add to society.\n\n## Colleague and contractor safety and wellbeing\n\nWe have a fundamental duty of care to ensure our colleagues are kept safe at work, and that their health is not affected as a result of their employment. The health, safety and wellbeing of/uni00A0employees and contractors is our primary concern. Any safety incident is one too many, and we work to improve our performance through effective policies, standards, procedures/uni00A0and training.\n\nWe measure safety performance through a/uni00A0combination of leading and lagging indicators, and LTIFR is one of the core KPIs of the business (see page 27). We take a proactive, risk-based approach to managing health and wellbeing, and have documented standards relating to occupational health and safety, process safety, and wellbeing and health. Incidents are reported to the highest level, and the Safety & Sustainability Committee of the Board undertakes regular deep dives on safety-related topics (see page 106).\n\n## Living wage and gender pay gap\n\nWe believe everyone should be appropriately rewarded for their time and effort. In the UK, we are accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, a/uni00A0commitment which extends to our contractors\n\nVolunteering work at Mudchute Park and Farm, East London, UK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the work they do on our behalf. We also go/uni00A0above the Living Wage requirements and voluntarily pay our trainees the Living Wage. We/uni00A0undertake a Living Wage review each year to/uni00A0ensure continued alignment and increase individual salaries as required, and also promote the commitment to our suppliers.\n\nWe review gender and ethnicity pay gaps annually in both the UK and US, and further information is provided in the RBR.\n\n## Promoting an inclusive and/uni00A0diverse/uni00A0workforce\n\nOur policy is that people who identify as having/uni00A0a/uni00A0disability should be given full and fair consideration for/uni00A0all vacancies against the requirements for the/uni00A0role. Where possible, we make reasonable accommodations and provide additional resources for employees who identify as having a disability. We are committed to equal opportunity in recruitment, training, promotion and career development for all colleagues, including those with disabilities.\n\nThe gender demographic table on the right shows the breakdown in numbers of employees by gender at different levels of the organisation. We have included information relating to subsidiary directors, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Report) Regulations 2013. 'Senior management' is defined as those managers who are at the same level, or one level below, the Group Executive Committee. It also includes those who are Directors of subsidiaries, or who have responsibility for planning, directing or controlling the activities of the Group, or a/uni00A0strategically significant part of the Group, and/uni00A0are employees of the Group. For further, more-detailed information relating to our\n\napproach and performance on gender and ethnic diversity, please see our RBR.\n\nWe continue to be recognised in awards and benchmarks including being listed Outstanding Employer for Race at the UK Ethnicity Awards, recognised in the top 10 for Company and Diversity Team of the Year at the British Diversity Awards and moved from 480 to 187 in the Financial Times special report on Diversity Leaders. We have close partnerships with external best practice organisations and are active members of sector- and industry-wide groups that ensure we are sharing best practice and campaigning at a sector-wide level for greater inclusion for all.\n\n## Gender demographic as at 31 March 2022\n\n|            | Our Board 1   | Senior management 2   | Whole Company 3   |\n|------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Male       | 7             | 110                   | 23,639            |\n| Female     | 6             | 58                    | 7,117             |\n| Total      | 13            | 168                   | 30,756 4          |\n| Male (%)   | 53.8%         | 65.5%                 | 76.9%             |\n| Female (%) | 46.2%         | 34.5%                 | 23.1%             |\n\n- 1.

Total energy consumption was 3,502 GWh (12,606,859 Gigajoules), an increase of 12% on the previous year. Of this, 99% was from non-renewable sources, with no significant change from the previous year. Total energy consumption in the UK was 2,341 GWh and total energy consumption in the US was 1,161 GWh.\n\nOperational energy use was 1,190 GWh (2020/21; 1,748 GWh), our transport energy use was 362 GWh (2020/21; 369 GWh), electricity consumption was 987 GWh (2020/21; 852 GWh) and heating was 163 GWh (2020/21; 156 GWh).\n\nElectricity consumption includes the energy consumed in operating the generation assets in the US. Total energy does not include fuels consumed for power generation on behalf of LIPA, the contracting body, amounting to 19,610 GWh (net of energy required to operate the generation assets), a 21% increase on the prior year. Energy consumption related to power generation can vary greatly year-on-year and is determined by LIPA. We therefore report an energy consumption figure net of power generation allowing us to report underlying energy consumption across our business. For transparency, we/uni00A0have reported energy consumption from power generation as a separate line item. Transport covers company car business travel, and our own operational ground and aviation fleet. In addition to energy consumed, we calculate that system losses accounted for a/uni00A0further 11,117 GWh, of which 51% occurred in the US. This was a 0.3% decrease on the previous year.\n\nNote: 2020/21 energy consumption has been re-stated to account for a minor misstatement following data reconciliation.",

Our RBC sets out a number of ambitious climate-related commitments, the most significant of which is to achieve net zero by 2050. Through this commitment we will reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 80% by 2030, 90%/uni00A0by 2040, and net zero by 2050, from a/uni00A01990 baseline. At the end of 2021/22, we/uni00A0have/uni00A0achieved a 65% reduction.\n\nOur Scope 3 target covers emissions across our entire value chain with a commitment to reduce the carbon emissions by 37.5% by financial year 2034 (from a financial year 2019 baseline). Our interim Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission reduction targets are validated by the SBTi, demonstrating a/uni00A0clear, credible commitment to achieve our longer-term net zero strategy in line with a well below 2\u00b0C pathway. Other commitments, including those relating to reductions in SF6 emissions and increasing the proportion of EVs in our own fleet, are set out in the RBC.\n\nWe will publish our Climate Transition Plan in June 2022 as part of the RBR.\n\nWe are working to reduce our business travel emissions by changing to alternative fuel vehicles and reducing business flights. The response required by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more flexible ways of working and has reduced business travel. We will reduce the energy consumed in our buildings and procure green energy where possible.\n\nOur Scope 1 emissions were 5.3 mtCO2e, a/uni00A012%/uni00A0increase on the prior year (4.7 mtCO2e). Of this, 89% arose in the US and 11% in the UK. The increase resulted mainly from generation emissions exceeding projected levels due to/uni00A0increased LIPA operating hours, required to/uni00A0replace shortfalls in off-island generation and/uni00A0transmission.\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported on a market and location basis:\n\n- \u00b7  market based - 2.2 mtCO2e, similar to the prior/uni00A0year\n- \u00b7  location based - 2.2 mtCO2e, similar to the prior/uni00A0year\n\nApproximately 57% of Scope 2 emissions (location basis) were generated in the UK, with the remainder through US operations. Reduction in Scope 2 emissions was mainly due to a/uni00A0reduction in emissions from line losses, resulting from a reduction in grid electricity carbon intensity.\n\nOur total Scope 3 emissions are calculated as 30.1 mtCO2e for the year, an increase of 4% on the prior year.\n\nWe measure and report in accordance with the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol. 100% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are independently assured against ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on/uni00A0Greenhouse Gas Statements, using an 'Operational Control' approach to determine our/uni00A0GHG emissions organisational boundary. The sources of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions are detailed in the RBR. We have also published a/uni00A0document, 'Our Reporting Methodology', which details the methodologies and protocols used for calculating key responsible business/uni00A0metrics.",

The Board in turn delegates some elements of responsibility to various subcommittees as described below. Our Board members bring a variety of skills and experience to the Board, including expertise in ESG and climate change matters. See page 88 - 89 for an/uni00A0overview of the Board's skills and experience.\n\nIn the year, the Board received regular updates from the Chair of the Safety & Sustainability Committee, providing an overview of matters discussed at the Committee meetings. This included updates on progress against goals and targets for addressing climate-related issues. The Board also receives a CEO report at each Board meeting which informs on how the Company is tracking against performance against metrics and targets and progress is reported through a regular dashboard. Additional updates received by the Board in the year are outlined here:\n\n- \u00b7  The Board was informed that the carbon emission reduction targets that had been set/uni00A0had been verified by the SBTi.\n- \u00b7  The Board was updated on current ESG positioning in the Company, including key strategy enhancements to keep pace with and/uni00A0to choose where to lead as a responsible business, and assurance around the right governance in place to provide a central organisational focus to drive strategy and performance. The Board was also updated on/uni00A0the impact of acquiring WPD on the Company's ESG agenda and opportunities including climate-related matters.\n- \u00b7  The Board discussed various aspects of the US business with US management, which included an update on the significant acceleration of the energy transition following President Biden's election and the Company's key clean energy ambitions in the US strategy.\n- \u00b7  An enrichment session was hosted by the Chief Sustainability Officer and management to provide focus for the Board on the Company's ESG and climate-related commitments, ahead of Board approval of/uni00A0year-end sustainability reporting. The session promoted the understanding of the architecture of the ESG commitments, the flow of approvals at various Committees, key stakeholders that are engaged in the process and to assure that ESG stewardship is/uni00A0well embedded at Board level.\n\nThe Board also reviewed its entire governance framework in the year to ensure the remit of the Committees remained appropriate and well placed to progress the Board's agenda going forward, in particular around tackling climate change and monitoring progress against net zero aims. Three of the Board Committees refreshed their remit and focus, including the Safety, Environment & Health Committee, which/uni00A0became the Safety & Sustainability Committee. Within the business there has been a continuing move towards clearer ownership of climate issues; a Chief Sustainability Officer was appointed in September 2021, providing a/uni00A0single point of accountability across the Group for our overarching sustainability strategy to help deliver the energy transition and ensure we drive our own emissions down to net zero by 2050. The Chief Sustainability Officer attends all Safety & Sustainability Committee meetings and provides regular updates at Board and management level, including holding a Board ESG enrichment session, covering ESG commitments, reporting and developments. The remit of the Board and its Committees under our governance framework is set out on page 91.

This includes reviewing whether appropriate progress is being made against our/uni00A0net zero aims. Progress around GHG emissions was considered and challenged in the year. The remit of the Committee was extended in the/uni00A0year to provide further oversight of climate-related matters including climate scenarios within/uni00A0TCFD and progress against the Company's climate transition plan which they reviewed in the year. The Committee also noted the changes to the Group Climate Change Risk which moved from what was a single strategic risk, to two risks - one strategic and one/uni00A0operational.\n\n## The Remuneration Committee recommends\n\nto the Board the remuneration policy for Executive Directors and the leadership team including approving how ESG targets are incorporated into our incentive arrangements. The Committee also reviews workforce remuneration and monitors related policies, satisfying itself that incentives and rewards are aligned to National Grid's strategy, culture and long-term sustainable success. During the year the Committee considered the remuneration policy to be presented to shareholders for approval at the 2022 AGM and increased the proportion of incentives linked to ESG and progress against climate-related targets.\n\n## The People & Governance Committee\n\noversees a diverse succession pipeline, helping to ensure we have the right people to deliver our strategy and net zero ambition. During the year the Committee approved the appointment of several new Non-executive Directors, taking into consideration skills and experience including climate. Martha Wyrsch, appointed in 2021, brings sound knowledge and/uni00A0experience around climate-related issues through her experience as CEO of a major international gas transmission business, as well/uni00A0as leading the growth and development of Vestas' renewables business in the US, where she spearheaded the expansion of its wind farm portfolio. Anne Robinson joined the Board in January 2022, bringing strong ESG experience and insight into investor perception around climate. Anne and Martha both joined the Safety & Sustainability Committee on appointment and along with the other members received an induction tailored to the Committee including around climate issues. See page 100 for/uni00A0more information around the skills and experience of our Board.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee has oversight over non-financial disclosures and assurance, including our RBR reporting, TCFD reporting and reporting in line with leading ESG frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Global Reporting Index (GRI) and the EU/uni00A0Taxonomy. The Committee received papers in March and May 2022 on the financial reporting and/uni00A0disclosure considerations in relation to climate change.\n\nThe Finance Committee oversees our financing strategy, including the issuance of National Grid plc's \u20ac850 million Green Bond in September 2021. The Finance Committee also considers the financial impact of environmental factors on our credit metrics and relevant considerations with regard to debt investors, pension and insurance strategy.\n\n## Management's role\n\nThe Board delegates to management responsibility for asset investment and maintenance planning, implementation of the net zero strategy and overseeing the development of the RBC. Management is also responsible on a day-to-day basis for the climate-related risks and opportunities faced by the Group and for delivering the roadmaps to achieve the net zero strategy set by the Board. Throughout the year, the Group Executive Committee created a/uni00A0number of sub-committees with delegated responsibility over specialist areas that receive updates on climate-related matters ahead of presentation, where applicable, to the Board and/uni00A0Committees.\n\nThe Safety, Health and Sustainability Sub-Committee reviews and manages Group-wide safety, environment and health tracking/monitoring and related decisions. The/uni00A0Chief Sustainability Officer attends this Committee, providing a link between management and Board discussions around climate-related issues. In the year, the Committee spent time reviewing progress against the Company's climate-related targets and shaped related strategy. In particular, the Committee reviewed potential impacts on our climate strategy and progress towards net zero from external events including the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis.\n\n## The Reputation & Stakeholder Management\n\nExecutive Sub-Committee provides oversight of responsible business policy development and engagement including in/uni00A0relation to the RBR and/uni00A0climate-related disclosures.\n\n## The Ethics, Risk and Compliance\n\nCommittee oversees the implementation of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Group's risk management framework and/uni00A0assessment of principal risks including climate change.\n\nThe Policy and Regulation Sub-Committee agrees and provides strategic oversight of Group/uni00A0public policy priorities and positions.\n\nThe Investment Committee has delegated/uni00A0authority to approve investment\n\ndecisions including those related to our Renewables/uni00A0business.\n\n## Other forums\n\nA TCFD steering group comprising representatives from Group External Reporting, Sustainability, Corporate Strategy, Group Risk and Company Secretariat oversees progress against the TCFD recommendations and the publication of/uni00A0our/uni00A0annual disclosure.\n\n## A Responsible Business steering group ,\n\nchaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer, provides oversight of the integration of responsible business into National Grid including/uni00A0the development of ESG targets and/uni00A0future ESG strategy.\n\n## Business Unit Green Financing Committees\n\nchaired by the Group Treasurer, provide governance over our Green Financing Programme and approve the publication of/uni00A0our/uni00A0Green Financing Report, which provides an analysis of how we utilised the proceeds from/uni00A0our portfolio of Green Bonds and their environmental impact.\n\nOur businesses . Further delegation and responsibility is given to the core operational businesses including the Business Unit Presidents, who are responsible and held accountable for delivering the net zero roadmaps/uni00A0for their businesses.\n\nOur functions.

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\n\n## Our strategy and risk management for responding to climate change\n\nNational Grid has four strategic priorities, as set/uni00A0out on pages 20 - 21, the first of which is to/uni00A0enable/uni00A0the energy transition for all. We have committed to support the decarbonisation of the communities that we serve, migrating to cleaner energy solutions. We have also committed to enabling a fully decarbonised electricity grid, to/uni00A0lead the way on the decarbonisation of gas and to enable the decarbonisation of transport. To/uni00A0support these strategic ambitions, we have/uni00A0recently executed a strategic pivot, via three transactions which will enhance our role in/uni00A0the energy transition. These transactions were/uni00A0the acquisition of WPD, the UK's largest electricity distribution network operator, in June 2021; and the proposed sales of our Rhode Island gas and electricity business in the US and of a/uni00A0majority stake in/uni00A0our UK Gas Transmission business expected to/uni00A0complete during 2022. Upon successful completion of all transactions, the contribution of electricity to National Grid's portfolio will increase to around 70% of the/uni00A0Group.\n\nAcross all of our businesses, we aim to play a/uni00A0leading role in enabling and accelerating the transition to a clean energy system, balancing decarbonisation, affordability and reliability of/uni00A0supply. Working closely with governments, other stakeholders, subject matter experts, and/uni00A0partners around the world and through our work for COP26, we focus on the technical and commercial solutions that will help achieve net zero for the energy sector. The biggest impact we can have is in enabling the economy-wide clean energy transition, but we must also\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreduce/uni00A0our own impact on the environment and/uni00A0strengthen our resiliency to risks that we have less control over. To accomplish this, our/uni00A0RBC commitments to reduce Scope 1 (direct emissions from our operational activities), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from our purchase and use of electricity) and Scope 3 (other indirect/uni00A0emissions from our value chain activities) emissions align with the requirements of the Paris Agreement and SBTi. These commitments, along with our overall suite of environmental sustainability initiatives, are reviewed in accordance with our quarterly business reviews, incorporating the risk/uni00A0and opportunities management processes detailed below, and reported accordingly to the/uni00A0Group Executive Committee and Board.\n\nCarbon pricing is one of the tools we use to support the delivery of our emissions reduction targets. We participate in traded carbon markets where our operations are covered by these frameworks, have regulatory incentives to reduce/uni00A0SF6 and methane emissions that are underpinned by a carbon price, and have applied an internal carbon price of $60/\u00a345 per/uni00A0tonne (set in 2017) in investment decision making. Additionally our latest UK regulatory agreements apply a price of \u00a3241/tonne.\n\nWe've found that a carbon price alone is unlikely/uni00A0to drive the changes needed to meet our/uni00A0net zero goals. As important are policies and commitments, such as those we have to remove and reduce SF6 leakage on our networks, and replace our fleet with electric vehicles. We are currently reviewing our approach to investment decision making to ensure we have the right mix of approaches to meet our commitments.\n\n## Case study Innovation for net zero\n\nWith funding from Ofgem's Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), we are/uni00A0delivering three innovation projects to help deliver a net zero electricity network.\n\n- \u00b7  The Sustainable Electrical Gas Insulated Lines (SEGIL) project will investigate the feasibility of an SF6-free Gas Insulated Line (GIL) solution to provide cost competitive, high-capacity transmission connections over 2000MVA to increase available network capacity for new offshore wind generation. The project will look at the options to replace SF6 with alternative low-carbon footprint gases as a viable means of GIL insulation.\n- \u00b7  The Super Conductor Applications for Dense Energy Transmission (SCADENT) project will develop an understanding of the barriers, opportunities, and benefits of modernising existing electricity infrastructure by replacing conventional cables with the use of High Temperature Superconductor (HTS) cable technology. This will increase network capacity, delivering time, cost, and carbon savings with reduced energy losses and wider environmental benefits including reduced disturbance to local communities caused by construction activities.\n- \u00b7  The Eye in the Sky Project, which utilises satellite data to improve grid resilience in emergency situations, will investigate new satellite data analytics solutions that can help GB networks to improve the visibility of infrastructure and assets, response in emergency and risk assess effects of climate change. Novel uses of satellite data and digital platforms can significantly improve network planning, modelling and forecasting capabilities, and improve the response to climate change effects like flooding, strong wind, snow storm or wildfire and provide warning to the networks for better planning and resource allocation during extreme weather events.\n\n## Identifying and assessing the impact of climate-related risks and /uni00A0opportunities\n\nThe scale of ambition and speed of change required to meet net zero emission targets, along with the changes in weather patterns, present both risks and opportunities to our business. These risks and opportunities, which are informed by our physical and transition risk scenario analysis and our horizon scanning processes, are built into our business planning and investment decision processes where we assess the degree of exposure to climate-related financial risks and opportunities. For our regulated businesses, our/uni00A0plans to address these are formulated with and agreed to/uni00A0by our regulators. Our management is incentivised through our target setting and remuneration policy to deliver the actions necessary to achieve our net zero objectives. This year, we agreed new ESG-related targets for our long-term incentive programme as detailed on page 113. We also launched a suite of/uni00A0internal climate change e-learning modules to/uni00A0help all employees learn more about climate/uni00A0change and our role in the energy transition. To/uni00A0accompany this, we conducted extensive pre-/uni00A0and post-COP26 employee engagement/uni00A0campaigns.\n\nSee page 75 for detail on our scenario modelling and page 79 for further detail on/uni00A0the/uni00A0significant risks and opportunities we identified and our/uni00A0response.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change and enterprise risk management\n\nClimate change is considered as part of our ERM process and has been one of our GPRs since autumn 2019. The ERM process is the framework through which the Group identifies, assesses, prioritises, manages, monitors and reports risks. This process is described on page 28 and includes the identification of a series of Group-wide controls and actions to mitigate the climate change principal risk (this is further described on page 30).\n\nHistorically, the climate change risk at the GPR level was managed through one broad risk covering both physical and transitional impacts of climate change on our business. In December 2021, the Executive Ethics, Risk & Compliance Committee agreed to split the climate change GPR into two distinct elements: adaptation and mitigation child risks. This has enabled greater alignment to our strategic objectives. The adaptation activity, absorbed within the 'significant disruption of energy' risk's control framework, will help ensure we continue to 'deliver for our customers efficiently', and the new standalone mitigation risk is aligned to our strategic objective, 'enable the energy transition for all'. This has generated greater oversight, focus and adoption of two distinct and proportionate control frameworks in line with the new Group risk appetite - mitigating downside risk, and maximising opportunities, where applicable.\n\n## Original Group climate change principal risk\n\nThere is a risk that we fail to identify and/or deliver upon actions necessary to address the physical and transitional impacts of climate change on our business and demonstrate our leadership of climate change within the energy sector.\n\n## 1. Climate change adaptation risk\n\nThe adaptation risk relates to the physical impact of climate change to our assets across the Group. This adaptation element of the original climate change risk is managed as part of the 'significant disruption of energy' GPR, wider resilience activity and associated internal controls.\n\n## 2. Climate change mitigation risk\n\nThe mitigation risk relates to our Group-wide strategy for climate change including our commitments of achieving net zero, and the role our Group plays in driving the energy transition. This is now managed as a standalone GPR.\n\nWe have further developed our risk and opportunity horizon scanning to assess critical trends to the energy transition. With our senior stakeholders and/uni00A0supported by external risk experts, we identified key indicators and metrics which are measured on a monthly basis versus thresholds. These are analysed against our current strategy and business plans for their potential impact and plausibility. Emerging risks are managed under our risk management framework with results reviewed by senior leadership (detailed further on page 29).\n\n## Integration of climate change into our overall risk management\n\nConsistent with the Group's overall approach to risk management and internal control, climate change risk management activities take place through all levels of our organisation. Our risk governance model drives an effective 'top-down, bottom-up' approach which allows the Group Executive Committee to define and cascade the GPRs to each business area; and in parallel, all business areas identify and escalate the operational risks that could impact their business model/uni00A0and objectives. The disclosure on page 28 provides further detail.\n\nThe Group's Risk Taxonomy supports all levels of the business to categorise any climate change risk into one of our four taxonomy groups: strategic, operational, financial and compliance; sub-categories beneath these four groups allow the business to select a more granular taxonomy grouping with an assigned risk appetite. The individual business unit or Group Function Risk Committees oversee, discuss and challenge new and existing climate change risks using the ERM framework and scoring methodology to ensure each risk has an appropriate inherent, current and target score for likelihood, financial and reputational impact. Where current risk levels are outside of agreed target scores and our risk appetite (based on the taxonomy), the business area implements actions and internal controls to close the gap.\n\nTo support accountability for both aspects of climate change risk, each business unit and applicable Group functions are currently in the process of considering, and where necessary, adopting an individual adaptation and mitigation child risk. As WPD is new to the Group, we are still in the process of/uni00A0integrating WPD into our ERM processes and will report back on our progress with respect to WPD's climate change risk management next year.\n\n## Our climate-related scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis to 2050 and beyond guides our strategic and financial planning with respect to climate change. Our scenarios consider the potential physical impacts to the Group of average global temperature increases of 2\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C. We also consider potential transitional impacts of/uni00A0scenarios of average global temperature increases of 1.5\u00b0C in accordance with the Paris climate agreement.\n\n## Transitional scenarios modelled\n\nPhysical scenarios modelled\n\n## Slow progress\n\n- \u00b7 Decarbonisation progress is made but too slow to meet net zero targets\n- \u00b7 Increase in distributed generation and local solutions where local authorities compensate for lack of overall national progress\n- \u00b7 System becomes increasingly unequal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Orderly transition\n\n- \u00b7 Reaches most net zero targets through an orderly/uni00A0approach\n- \u00b7 Governments pursue suite of solutions for large-scale and consumer options\n- \u00b7 Coordinated pathway between key market players e.g. orderly reduction in natural gas\n- \u00b7 Increased investment in renewable electric generation and networks\n- \u00b7 Gas network evolution to allow H2 clusters/uni00A0and/or clean gas blending\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acceleration\n\n- \u00b7 Reaches 2030 net zero targets to be on track for/uni00A02050\n- \u00b7 Electrification of heat and transport at fast pace\n- \u00b7 Accompanied by large-scale investments (network,/uni00A0storage)\n- \u00b7 Increased grid scale and interconnection with smart homes and end-use electrification\n- \u00b7 Faster gas demand reduction",

We developed the following stretching, plausible alternative futures for our society by using different assumptions across variables, including (but not limited to) technology, policy, consumer behaviour, competition and science. We tested the resilience of our business strategy against these different transition scenarios, whilst focusing our physical risk scenarios on the climate change hazards which present the greatest physical risk to/uni00A0the Group's operations.\n\n## Physical modelling\n\nThe climate hazards that we tested in our 2 degree and 4 degree scenario analysis are summarised below. The climate hazard data is sourced from the/uni00A0national climate assessments (NCA4 in the US, and UKCP18 in the UK). These assessments include data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, NOAA Physical Sciences Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Met Office, Environment Agency and academic literature.

Therefore, the above highlights the potential changes under a/uni00A04/uni00A0degree/uni00A0scenario for both the UK and the US. The changes outlined will still occur under the 2 degree scenario but there will be more intense and higher frequency of/uni00A0occurrence/uni00A0under 4\u00b0C.\n\n## Physical insights\n\nIn assessing the physical impacts of our scenarios, we grouped our portfolio of assets into 12 asset types to assess vulnerability to these hazards. For our 2 degree scenario, the climate data was not yet available in the UK national climate assessment chosen for this analysis, but based on the US findings under this/uni00A0scenario, we can assume similar impacts in/uni00A0the UK, as outlined below. Note, vulnerability to hazards does not mean that risks will be realised. Whether vulnerability translates into risk depends on the exposure (location) of individual assets relative to projected changes in climate hazards, as well as any site-specific resilience measures in place. Although to a lesser degree, our analysis has identified consistent risks that exist today, e.g. flooding, consistent with our wider risk management we are implementing necessary responses to those risks, e.g. flood defences, to ensure reliable operation of our assets and sufficient resilience today as well as/uni00A0into the future.\n\nMost hazards are projected to increase in frequency in the future, with high temperatures and coastal flooding of particular concern. In/uni00A0most cases the level of risk is greater in a/uni00A04\u00b0C/uni00A0scenario than a 2\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## The hazards that we consider are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCoastal flooding\n\nHigh and low temperatures\n\nRiver flooding\n\nHeatwaves\n\nHigh winds\n\nLightning\n\nFreeze-thaw cycles\n\nHigh winds and high precipitation",

We do know that climate change will lead to increased rainfall, wind speeds, and coastal flooding/storm surges due to sea level rises, so this may make future coastal storms more damaging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisks from high temperature and heatwaves will increase significantly over time for many asset types, particularly overhead lines for transmissions and distribution.\n\nOur risk assessment shows the risk to our existing asset portfolio only. If the distribution and types of assets change, then the cumulative picture of risk will change too.\n\nThe insights from our physical risk scenario modelling show that all scenarios will result in physical impacts to the Group's assets across consistent areas of our operations; however, the impacts are most material in a 4\u00b0C scenario.\n\nWe are continuing to progress our physical risk analysis to inform our strategic planning and investment choices. Over the next year, we aim to implement a higher resolution assessment of key risks identified, particularly where risk is extremely localised, e.g. flood-related risk and coastal areas which are exposed to multiple hazards. We will consider the interdependencies between hazards to better understand the resiliency of asset criticality and prioritisation of actions to reduce risks. We also aim to add socio-economic data into the model, to understand where communities at greater socioeconomic risk, like environmental justice communities, and at-risk assets are coupled. The next version of our risk assessment will also incorporate National Grid Renewables and WPD. For further detail on our assessment of the physical impacts of our scenario modelling, please refer to the Climate Change Risk Tool case study below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Case study: Climate Change Risk Tool\n\nWe have developed an innovative Climate Change Risk Tool (CCRT) which allows each business to make more tailored use of the scenario analysis. The CCRT is available to all, so offers a/uni00A0simple way for employees such as asset owners, strategy managers and senior leaders to access the information they need for their particular interest area and at the right level of detail.\n\nThe CCRT gives a UK and US geographical overview of climate change risk and allows users to/uni00A0filter information focused to their business area, specific asset types and to a grid square level of 12km in the UK and 7km in the US.\n\nThe hazards that we consider are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe CCRT shows the changing climate change risk profile for 2030, 2040, 2050 and 2070. An/uni00A0example of the results from the CCRT showing the changing risk profile of high temperatures on our UK Electricity Transmission assets under a 4 degree climate scenario is shown on the right. The CCRT shows that as we progress out to 2070, there will be an increased frequency of/uni00A0high temperature as a hazard in the UK, i.e. the number of days per year when the maximum daily temperature is above 30\u00b0C (shown on the-left hand graph and map). We can then see on the right-hand graph and map the level of risk this translates for our ET assets across the network and over time.\n\nRisks from river and coastal flooding are significant for all asset types now and in future climates. By the 2070s, almost all assets by the coast may be at high risk from coastal flooding. In coastal areas, assets can be exposed to increases in occurrence of coastal flooding and high temperatures in the/uni00A0future. For some asset types, most of the infrastructure is located in coastal areas, such as terminals and converter stations in the UK,/uni00A0and LNG/CNG facilities and generation assets in the US. Generation assets on Long Island are highlighted for the particular risk of/uni00A0coastal flooding.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our analysis, we do not make a judgement on the likelihood of any one scenario relative to others; and by design, the analysed scenarios do not encompass all possible future pathways and their associated risks. There are limitations within the scope of our modelling, e.g./uni00A0available data across other sectors, but to minimise this impact we have utilised a wide range of resources and compared our results with external/uni00A0scenarios.\n\n## Transition insights\n\nWhilst current global climate policies and actions suggest a lower than 4\u00b0C scenario, a 4\u00b0C scenario was still modelled in line with our approach to scenario modelling outlined above. The transition impact to the Group is most significant in scenarios resulting in a lower degree of warming given the increased action required. The following five transition insights are therefore most relevant to a 2\u00b0C (or lower) scenario. However each still applies, albeit to/uni00A0a lesser extent, to a 4\u00b0C scenario as well.\n\n## Insight and factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nUrgent collective action required across society To reach net zero requires new policies and technology development.

Further detail on the transition risks and opportunities identified in our scenario analysis, including estimated qualitative and quantitative impacts where applicable, can be found on pages 79 - 82.\n\n## How we manage our climate-related risks\n\nAs part of our ERM process, risk owners and other key stakeholders establish internal controls to manage the risk within appetite. Regular risk reviews consider the effectiveness of individual controls as well as the collective strength of the internal control framework which determines the financial and reputational impact, and likelihood of the risk to materialise. Where current risk levels are outside of agreed target scores and our risk appetite, remedial or continuous improvement plans will be agreed to mitigate the/uni00A0current risk score.\n\nThe controls for our new climate change principal risk (mitigation) have evolved in line with our strategy and regulatory frameworks. They include controls on strategic oversight and governance (for example, Board and Group Executive Committee sign-off on strategy and oversight of delivery against net zero action plans), business unit roadmap and operational plans to deliver net zero targets (that are aligned to Group's strategy) and investment plans\n\n(providing leadership to structural changes, e.g./uni00A0bringing to scale new technologies). Controls related to the climate change risk are also reflected throughout other relevant risks, for/uni00A0example regulatory outcomes; political and societal expectations; and significant disruption of energy.\n\nThe significant disruption of energy risk and controls demonstrates how we are adapting as an organisation to manage the impact of climate change to our assets. Our key climate adaptation controls include the following:\n\n- \u00b7  Fit for Future of Electricity Strategy: a/uni00A0corporate strategy that considers the future electricity business, including our network resilience and changing environment, and the steps to ensure our business remains resilient in the future, such as enhanced design standards, and investments on asset hardening and flood protection.\n- \u00b7  Engineers Governance forums: Chief Engineers and Engineering Duty Holders meet to provide guidance and data-sharing on/uni00A0key topics such as resilience.\n- \u00b7  Resilience and Asset Management Business Management Standards (BMS): sets out minimum requirements and framework for resilience capability and managing asset risk to ensure each business unit is prepared for the next disruptive event, including the changing environment.\n- \u00b7  Organisational Resilience Competency Framework: to guide, measure and where applicable, heighten our resilience response across the Group under different climate change scenarios.\n- \u00b7  Business Continuity and Crisis Management: ongoing development of a new business continuity software application to ensure a/uni00A0consistent view across the Group, and internal crisis management tool to respond more effectively to incidents, drive consistency, and/uni00A0identify and track actions.\n\nThe quality of assurance over key controls has/uni00A0been enhanced following roll-out of a new control testing methodology, that integrates the/uni00A0first line and second lines of defence.\n\nEnergy supply structure will shift There will be a shift to renewables power, notable offshore wind and solar.

Risk owners across the Group have the ability to view assurance of their controls in real time, using newly developed PowerBI/uni00A0dashboards.\n\nAs outlined above, with regard to our greenhouse gas emissions, where/uni00A0specific actions are identified to achieve our strategy, drive desired/uni00A0behaviours and manage our risks, we set SMART targets for those/uni00A0accountable. Performance against those targets is published transparently, principally through the RBR and the results contribute to the assessment of remuneration for those/uni00A0accountable. For the most material performance measures, an external assurance opinion is received over the/uni00A0accuracy of preparation; a/uni00A0copy of this opinion can be found on our/uni00A0website.\n\n## Risk/opportunity\n\n## Potential impact\n\n## Our response\n\n## 1. Transition Risk &/uni00A0Opportunity\n\nRetaining customer buy-in will be/uni00A0key: cost transparency and scrutiny on Network Operators is likely to increase as there will be a/uni00A0focus on the impact of transition costs on customers' bills. Whilst National Grid can support the progression towards an affordable transition, there is a risk that customers and/or regulators may perceive that too little is being done to manage pressures on affordability, resulting in damaged reputation and damaged regulatory relationships.\n\n## Business:\n\nGroup-wide\n\nTimeframe:\n\nShort, medium and long term\n\n## Likelihood:\n\nModerate\n\n## Measurement indicators:\n\n% of NG transmission/distribution costs on customer bills, customer trust survey, feedback through the fair transition plan.\n\nThe reputation of our business has wide implications to our operations; affecting our regulatory negotiations and the resulting regulatory returns and incentives of the frameworks within which we operate. Our reputation can affect our cost of doing business, from customer feedback, employee retention, productivity, supplier relationships, and ultimately our share price. All/uni00A0have impacts that can move in/uni00A0either way, depending on our perceived success in enabling the fair and affordable energy transition.\n\nDue to the nature of the risk/ opportunity, and the degree of external variables affecting the matter, it is difficult to meaningfully quantify the risk. However, if not managed effectively, it could undermine the corporate strategy and materially impact our financial/uni00A0performance.\n\nBeing at the 'heart of a clean and fair transition' is our purpose and our regulatory strategy team has a strong focus on affordability for/uni00A0consumers, working with regulators to minimise impacts to customer bills and to introduce affordability mechanisms. We will also advocate for anticipatory investment to/uni00A0minimise the costs to/uni00A0consumers and will use our CCRT to/uni00A0inform our/uni00A0investment decisions to ensure the resilience of/uni00A0our/uni00A0assets.\n\nAn example of our focus on affordability for customers is our/uni00A0recently launched Expanded Solar-For-All programme in the/uni00A0US, where nearly 160,000 National Grid upstate New York electricity customers will benefit from new solar-energy bill credit, thanks to a joint offering from National Grid and the New/uni00A0York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The Expanded Solar-For-All programme, approved by/uni00A0state regulators in January 2022, will automatically provide monthly credits to income-eligible customers enrolled in National Grid's Energy Affordability Programme.\n\nThe programme is designed to deliver the benefits of community solar to low-income customers, who are often shut out of renewable energy sources due to cost. Community solar is a/uni00A0large array of solar panels at an offsite location that allows customers to access solar power without installing panels on their homes. Developers build and operate the community solar projects, and energy delivery companies like National Grid purchase and distribute the credits generated by the projects to/uni00A0participating customers.\n\nThe bill credits would grow over three years as the programme expands, with customers receiving monthly discounts. In Expanded Solar-For-All's first phase, National Grid anticipates providing $240 million in total bill credits during the 25-year lifetime of the programme. A proposed second phase would further expand the programme, doubling the total anticipated bill/uni00A0credits to $480 million over the programme's lifetime. The second phase will be contingent on approval by state regulators.\n\nThe Expanded Solar-For-All programme brings to life two pillars of/uni00A0Project C, National Grid's commitment to the communities where we work and live: clean energy and sustainability, and environmental justice and social equity.\n\n## Our significant climate-related risks and opportunities and our strategic response\n\nGuided by our scenario modelling, strategic planning and risk management approaches articulated above, the climate-related risks and opportunities that pose a potentially significant financial or reputational impact are detailed below, along with our basis of measuring the risk/opportunity and/uni00A0our strategic response to each risk/opportunity that underpins our resilience assessments. To assess the relative materiality, we established scope of impact, timeframe and likelihood for each risk and opportunity using internal analysis, market data and input from subject matter experts across our business. Refer to the subsequent section for further information on measurement indicators, including our performance against them. We assessed which businesses would be impacted against whether there was a risk that could materially affect our ability to meet business objectives and/ or, is of material importance to stakeholders. The timeframes we have used to assess the climate-related risks and opportunities are short: up to 2025, medium: from 2025 to 2030 and long-term: from 2030 to 2050. Our 'likelihood' assessment is an indicative estimate of the probability for material financial impacts with reference to the following categorisation:\n\n- \u00b7  Low: Very unlikely to unlikely\n- \u00b7  Moderate: About as likely as not to occur\n- \u00b7  High: Likely to very likely to occur",

Transition Risk &/uni00A0Opportunity\n\nUrgent collective action is required: with its central role as/uni00A0the backbone of the energy sector, National Grid can play a/uni00A0crucial role in the transition. As/uni00A0a/uni00A0result, public focus will increase on our Company, increasing reputational risk.\n\nBusiness:\n\nGroup-wide\n\nTimeframe:\n\nShort, medium and long term\n\nLikelihood:\n\nModerate\n\nMeasurement indicators:\n\nGHG emissions, Climate/uni00A0Transition Plan, customer feedback\n\n## 3. Transition Opportunity\n\nElectricity use and share of final demand will increase: with/uni00A0the transition pivoting energy needs from fossil fuels to cleaner gas and electricity, the/uni00A0Group will deliver a larger share of society's needs in the/uni00A0future. This will increase investment opportunities as/uni00A0growth is across transmission and distribution electricity/uni00A0networks.\n\n## Business:\n\nET, ED, NY, NE, NGV, ESO\n\nTimeframe: Short, medium and long term\n\nLikelihood: High\n\nMeasurement indicators: EU Taxonomy KPIs, green capex forecasts, GHG emissions\n\nThe reputation of our business has wide implications to our operations; affecting our regulatory negotiations and the resulting regulatory returns and incentives of the frameworks within which we operate. Our reputation can affect/uni00A0our cost of doing business, from employee retention, productivity, supplier relationships, customer feedback, cost of/access to finance and ultimately our share price. All have impacts that can move in either way, depending on our perceived success in enabling the energy/uni00A0transition.\n\nDue to the nature of the risk/ opportunity, and the degree of/uni00A0external variables affecting the matter, it is difficult to meaningfully quantify the risk. However, if/uni00A0not managed effectively, the matter could undermine our corporate strategy and materially impact our financial performance.\n\nSensitivities have been run versus our business plan to investigate the impact of the/uni00A0scenarios and we will continue to monitor triggers to/uni00A0capital expenditure.\n\nWe estimate that the Orderly Transition or Acceleration scenario would result in an increase over the Slow Progress scenario of between 0.5% to 1.0% in underlying operating profit CAGR over the period to 31 March 2031. Capital expenditure increases may include expanding electricity networks, natural gas leak reductions and investment and expansion of renewable generation operations, but these are expected to be within our regulatory regime.\n\nBeyond 2030, and in line with/uni00A0our scenario modelling, the/uni00A0trends towards greater electrification, driven by expanded renewables generation and investment into decarbonising our gas networks is/uni00A0expected to continue and may/uni00A0accelerate.\n\nTo date, we have endeavoured to take account of this by/uni00A0being at the heart of a fair, clean and affordable future, working with governments, policy makers and regulators to/uni00A0shape net zero strategy. Accordingly, we have positioned ourselves as 'The Energy Transition Company' acting as a/uni00A0principal sponsor of COP26, and our ESO business has set an ambition to operate a/uni00A0zero-carbon system by 2025, with the goal to run 100% carbon free energy 24/7/365 by 2035. We will continue to focus on enabling the transition, including working in partnership with our regulators and other stakeholders to develop investment plans in line with the net/uni00A0zero commitments of their jurisdictions, whilst managing the costs to consumers.\n\nWe have developed roadmaps and track progress against key milestones for each of our business units which include the actions, conditions and assumptions that will support the delivery of our emissions reduction targets. These plans are consolidated into a group roadmap which is/uni00A0presented in our Climate Transition Plan, which we've published alongside this year's Responsible Business Report.\n\nOur acquisition of WPD positions National Grid for this increase in electricity use across transmission and distribution. We are also continuing to invest in both onshore/uni00A0renewables via National Grid Renewables and in/uni00A0our/uni00A0interconnector portfolio, which will form an important part of UK decarbonisation.\n\nAcross our businesses, we are also heavily investing in the infrastructure required to support the decarbonisation of transport and during 2021 in the US we delivered 1,684 EV charging ports in our jurisdictions, a company record for a/uni00A0calendar year.\n\nWe are also carrying out critical studies and pilots exploring how to decarbonise our gas networks, for example the HyGrid project described in Transition Risk 6 and the FutureGrid project, which is/uni00A0testing the possibility of converting the NTS in the UK to transport/uni00A0hydrogen.\n\nIn the UK, we are continuing to work with the Department for Transport and the Office of Zero Emissions Vehicles to ensure that the underlying network infrastructure is in place, ahead of need, to support the successful delivery of Project Rapid. We welcomed the Transport Decarbonisation Plans commitment to publish an Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Strategy and establish a Delivery Body to progress the grid upgrades required to meet future ambitions.\n\nWe also continue to engage with key stakeholders from across all modes of transport through our 'ask, not tell' engagement principles to understand the main barriers and potential future demand and infrastructure requirements for each sector.",

Our capital investment forecast to 2026 contains c.\u00a31.6bn relating to/uni00A0renewables.\n\nOur ESO business is investing to ensure it is able to operate the system safely and securely at zero carbon whenever there is sufficient renewable generation online and available to meet the total national load. This year, the ESO agreed to contracts with five parties, worth \u00a3328 million over a six-year period, in a/uni00A0world-first approach to managing the stability of the electricity/uni00A0system.\n\nWe are also supporting the accelerated development of electricity grids worldwide. At COP26 we joined the UK and Indian governments to launch the Green Grids Initiative, One/uni00A0Sun One World One Grid (GGI-OSOWOG), aiming to accelerate global expansion and modernisation of energy grids. This is an ambitious plan backed by over 80 countries and looks to harness the full potential of renewable resources globally, through much greater interconnection of electricity grids, so electricity can be moved from where it's generated to where it's/uni00A0needed. The GGI will help make this happen by bringing together a global coalition of stakeholders, including governments and businesses, to speed up/uni00A0the expansion of/uni00A0energy grids across regions and continents. We are playing a leading role in this as a member of the GGI.\n\nOur NGV and NGP businesses actively monitor and participate in/uni00A0emerging growth opportunities and will continue/uni00A0to do so in the future. During the year, National Grid Renewables invested \u00a3199 million into renewable generation assets via the Emerald joint venture. Further to this, NG Renewables invested \u00a3223 million in the offshore wind seabed lease awarded in the New York Bight. During the year, NGP, our venture capital business that invests in energy technology startups, made 13 new investments bringing the total portfolio value to $491 million across 38 investments. Example investments include: TS Conductor, a California-based company whose technology replaces legacy materials in high-voltage electricity transmission lines with a next-generation conductor that doubles the lines' capacity without/uni00A0the need to retrofit towers or other infrastructure; and/uni00A0Risilience, a UK-based startup that helps companies manage their transformation to net zero emissions.\n\nWe also continue to invest in our interconnector portfolio and,/uni00A0once Viking Link becomes commercially operational in 2023/24, NGV will hold 7.8 GW of interconnector capacity and the focus will switch to multi-purpose interconnectors, which will/uni00A0increase interconnection and facilitate the construction and expansion of/uni00A0wind farms in the North/uni00A0Sea.",

For further information, see page 181.\n\nWe experience significant costs as/uni00A0a result of asset damage and operational interruptions due to major storms (2021/22: \u00a3163 million 2020/21: \u00a3150 million). We therefore continue to invest in storm hardening across the Group, with a/uni00A0further \u00a336 million invested in the/uni00A0year.\n\nWe are in the process of expanding our scenario modelling to forecast the likely financial implications of/uni00A0a/uni00A02 and 4 degree scenario over/uni00A0the/uni00A0long term.

More/uni00A0details can be found in our Vision Report\n\nhttps://www.nationalgrid.com/us/fossilfree .\n\nWe will continue to engage in key regulatory proceedings and/uni00A0processes in New York and Massachusetts to maximise recovery on our gas business assets. These include the ongoing DPU 20-80 'Future of Gas' proceeding in Massachusetts and a/uni00A0KEDNY/KEDLI depreciation study that will be submitted to the/uni00A0New York PSC in advance of our rate/uni00A0case filing in 2023.\n\nAn example of our work in this area is the $741 million of investment our New York business has committed to in the five year capital investment forecast to FY26. This investment covers a range of storm hardening measures, upgrades and repairs to our infrastructure to make it less susceptible to/uni00A0storm damage. These include inspection and maintenance, minor storm hardening, vegetation management, flood mitigation, side tap fusing, and multi-value transmission reliability.\n\nIn the UK, our ESO business has undertaken Mapping Impacts and Visualisation of Risks (MIVOR) of extreme weather on system operation to evaluate the impacts of extreme weather events on system operation up to 2050 under RCP 4.5.

We have a commitment to reduce our impact by achieving net zero for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050, with interim targets of an 80% reduction by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2040, from a/uni00A01990 baseline. Alongside this, we have a/uni00A0Scope 3 emissions reduction target of a/uni00A037.5% reduction by FY 2034 from an FY 2019 baseline year. This target includes all of our Scope 3 emissions. Our GHG emissions reduction targets are science-based and approved by the SBTi.\n\nNumerous underlying metrics support and complement this goal as part of our broader sustainability ambition, including reducing our energy consumption, enhancing the natural value of our landholdings, recycling and/or reusing our recovered assets and reducing our office waste.

        "page_content": "## Chair's statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to present to you the 2021/22 Corporate Governance Report, my first as Chair of the Company.\n\n## The year in review\n\nThere has been no shortage of opportunities for engaged governance by the National Grid Board. The Company had a full agenda coming into the fiscal year: overseeing performance amidst a lingering pandemic and then the safe return to work; ensuring that our provision of service is consistent with society's expectations of us; advancing our agenda of change as we make commitments to reach net zero; seeing through several major transactions; and supporting an evolving Group culture of accountability, agility and performance. The foregoing promised a busy year. Over the summer of 2021, a crisis in the retail energy markets in the UK began to unfold. Leading up to COP26, there were increasing pressures on both sides of the Atlantic for more rapid decarbonisation of energy. Then the threats of war became a stark reality. Ukraine was invaded and, almost overnight, energy supply security became the dominant theme. Our stakeholders have to be assured that we can identify and manage all of these risks. At the same time, we/uni00A0have to help balance aspirations regarding transformation with the exigencies of current delivery. All of these responsibilities are our job as board members, along with ensuring that we have a qualified, engaged, diverse workforce to succeed amidst an era of great change.\n\nMy tenure as Chair commenced as directors were nearing or had completed their nine-year terms. Identifying suitable qualified replacements who could quickly come up to speed and yet/uni00A0bring fresh perspectives was essential. Fortunately, a well-vetted business plan was already in place and the change in board composition was orderly. We were able to quickly review Committee remits and composition and to refine the responsibilities and ownership of the Committees where much of the Board's work is/uni00A0undertaken.\n\nNevertheless, one thing I've observed in my years as a Non-executive Director is that operationally urgent matters can easily overtake consideration of truly important matters in a busy board agenda. So last summer, our Board took the time for what I believe was a critical set of conversations namely coming to agreement on what were the big strategic questions that National Grid was\n\nlikely to face in the next several years. We asked ourselves, what topics would be worthy of the Board's time? Why were they important? How would we get the most salient information? Which external and internal resources would be available to shape our perspectives? These questions may appear simplistic. But in my experience, effective stewardship starts by making sure that a board spends time on the matters that really count. I/uni00A0hope to use this report as a means to share with you some of the issues we are tackling in our Board discussions.\n\nNone of the foregoing has any meaning unless we cast a critical eye on our own performance. We have adopted board goals and we retained an independent advisor to help us assess our group effectiveness as well as the effectiveness of each director; see page 97 for further detail. These honest conversations on how we are doing are foundational to our being the kind of/uni00A0board which you can entrust the stewardship of your Company.\n\n## Board composition\n\nAs you will have noted, several distinguished Board members reached the end of their terms in the year. Sir Peter Gershon, previous Board Chair until I assumed the role when he stepped down on 31 May 2021, is/uni00A0a distinguished businessman and advisor to government, known for his laser-like focus on productivity and performance. Dr. Paul Golby, a/uni00A0member of the Royal Academy of Engineering, has deep, relevant experience across the power sector, and contributed immeasurably to all the technical and strategy decisions the Company has made during his tenure. Mark Williamson, with a/uni00A0long career in finance, has wisely counselled on our financial and controls framework, as well as being the trusted Senior Independent Director, and Nicola Shaw, a/uni00A0key member of the management team in/uni00A0the role as UK Executive Director since 2016. All four retired from the Board in 2021. Jonathan Dawson, who will leave the Board at the AGM, has been the independent voice for the alignment of strategy and reward. In addition, Amanda Mesler, who has been a member of our Board for the last four years, has decided not to stand for re-election. Amanda was a great supporter of the investments in technology that have proved invaluable over these last several years. On behalf of my Board colleagues, I express my appreciation to all/uni00A0of/uni00A0them.\n\nNevertheless, from this loss comes opportunity. We have been fortunate to have recruited five new directors who bring fresh perspectives and diverse experience to the Board. Ian Livingston, former Chief Executive of BT, comes with the battle scars of industry transformation and expertise in finance. Tony Wood, a sitting CEO/uni00A0and a member of the Royal Academy of Aeronautical Engineering, brings the perspective that safety, productivity and innovation are not to/uni00A0be traded off, but must be driven apace in lock-step. Martha Wyrsch has worked directly in/uni00A0the energy sector in all its aspects - power, natural gas, and renewables, regulated and unregulated. She brings wisdom and practical advice to the boardroom.\n\nAnne Robinson, an/uni00A0active executive in one of the/uni00A0largest asset/uni00A0management companies in the world, has/uni00A0substantial business and transactional experience and, in her current role, the most relevant background in ESG that we could imagine. Iain Mackay, who is joining the Board upon election at this AGM, is a sitting CFO with/uni00A0experience in industry prior to joining the fast-paced world of pharmaceuticals. These new/uni00A0Directors, along with those who continue to/uni00A0serve, bring strategic thoughtfulness, engagement, constructive challenge,\n\nindependence and gravitas to our deliberations. As a group, they demonstrate our continued commitment to diversity on our Board and within/uni00A0National Grid's organisation overall.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWhilst virtual engagement has become the norm over the past two years, it has been a great pleasure to resume in-person engagement in recent months. One can get an authentic sense of what is going on within an organisation or with society at large by meeting people, listening to how individuals and groups have fared, and seeing first-hand the challenges on the ground. In recent months, Board members have undertaken site visits. We have also had virtual/uni00A0and in-person engagement sessions throughout the year with employees. Page 96 provides more detail.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nLast year I was one of the many individuals affected by COVID-19 travel restrictions and was/uni00A0unable to participate in the 2021 AGM in person. Given the situation at the time, we did not encourage attendance by any shareholder. For/uni00A0our 2022 meeting, we revert to business as usual but with another option. I'm pleased to share that we are offering the opportunity for you to participate in a 'hybrid AGM'. You will be able to/uni00A0join the meeting online and yet be able to participate in live voting and the Q&A session, as/uni00A0if you were in the room. Please note, too, that/uni00A0we are putting to vote for the first time our Climate Transition Plan this year. The discussion of this resolution should illuminate National Grid's resolve to move to net zero and to provide metrics by which we can all track progress. Further details on this are outlined in the Notice/uni00A0of Meeting for the AGM and on the Company's website.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nYour Board will continue to focus on the key issues, challenge the Group's leadership, and collectively seek to make wise decisions. In an ever-changing world, we pledge to you that whatever lies ahead, we have the best interests of your Company, its customers, and its people central to our deliberations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaula Rosput Reynolds Chair",

All Committee changes were effective 1 September 2021.\n\n## Committees:\n\nThe Safety & Sustainability Committee (previously the Safety, Environment & Health Committee) expanded its remit to increase focus on sustainability strategy and related external disclosures. This allows the Committee to have the in-depth discussions required on these topics with Board members best placed to provide insight and overview, enabling the Committee to review specific safety- and sustainability- related risks and providing a greater oversight of related Group Principal Risks. The Committee report is on page 106.\n\n- The Audit & Risk Committee (previously the Audit Committee) repositioned to give a greater focus to risk with increased time now spent reviewing principal, emerging and child risks in relation to the Company's risk management and controls processes. The Committee report is on page 101.\n- The People & Governance Committee (previously the Nominations Committee) expanded its remit to focus further on wider succession within the organisation as well as core governance issues such as the workforce engagement programme for the year. The Committee report is on page 99. All Committee compositions were reviewed and revised to ensure a suitable spread of skills and experience that complement the revised remit of our/uni00A0Committees, details of which can be found in each Committee report.\n\nGovernance processes: our review extended to refreshing the Board Governance document to ensure this reflected the wider Committee remits and/uni00A0clear Chair and CEO roles. We moved from eight scheduled Board meetings annually to six meetings made possible through reviewing our cadence of reporting and Board pack materials with an efficiency programme introduced to ensure that reporting is as effective and concise as possible. This allows greater time at Board meetings to focus on goals, priorities and strategic topics, enabling quality discussion to deliver our strategy. The Board will continue to review its framework annually to satisfy itself that it continues to be best aligned to the Company's purpose and strategy.\n\nGroup Executive Committee: supports the CEO's decision making. To do this, the roles of the overall Committee/uni00A0and supporting sub-committees were refreshed to provide a more optimal way to communicate and understand key business information - specifically, having the right people discussing the most relevant topics in the sub-committees, enabling better decision making at the top of the/uni00A0organisation.\n\n## Board composition and roles\n\nOur Board comprises of a Non-executive Chair (independent on appointment), two Executive Directors (CEO and CFO), and 10 independent Non-executive Directors, as at the date of this report. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the Chair and CEO, reflected in the Board Governance document available on our website. A list of our Directors' biographies can be found on pages 88 and 89.\n\nOur Chair sets Board meeting agendas and ensures the Board receives accurate, timely and clear information to monitor, challenge, guide and take sound decisions. She is responsible for promoting a culture of open debate between Executive and Non-executive Directors. Our Chair also facilitates effective communication with shareholders and other stakeholders and promotes high standards of corporate governance, ensuring Directors understand the views of the Company's shareholders and other key stakeholders, and their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act.\n\nOur Chief Executive is responsible for the executive leadership and day-to-day management of the Company, to ensure the delivery of the strategy agreed by the Board.\n\nOur Chief Financial Officer is responsible for providing strategic financial leadership to the Company and for the day-to-day management of the finance function.\n\nOur independent Non-executive Directors are responsible for contributing sound judgement and objectivity to Board deliberations and the overall decision-making process, providing constructive challenge, and monitoring the Executive Directors' delivery of the strategy within the Board's risk and governance structure.\n\nOur Senior Independent Director provides a sounding board for the Chair and serves as a trusted intermediary for the other Directors, as well as/uni00A0shareholders, as required. She meets with the Non-executive Directors (without the Chair present) when necessary and at least once a year to appraise the Chair's performance and communicates the results to the Chair and People & Governance Committee.\n\nOur Group General Counsel & Company Secretary has responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of the Company's governance framework. All/uni00A0Directors have access to her advice.\n\n## Independence and time commitment\n\nWe monitor and note potential conflicts of interest that each Director may have and recommend to the Board whether these should be authorised and/uni00A0if any conditions should be attached to such authorisations. Directors are reminded regularly of their continuing obligations in relation to conflicts and review and confirm their external interests at least annually. This is then used to consider whether each Director continues to be independent. Following due consideration, the Board determined that all Non-executive Directors continued to be effective and independent in both character and judgement in their roles. The table below sets out Director attendance at Board meetings during the year to 31 March 2022.\n\n| Director              | Attendance   | Director        | Attendance   | Director          | Attendance   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds | 10/10        | Ian Livingston  | 5/5 2        | Martha Wyrsch     | 4/4 2        |\n| John Pettigrew        | 10/10        | Amanda Mesler   | 10/10        | Former Director   |              |\n| Andy Agg              | 10/10        | Anne Robinson   | 2/2 2        | Sir Peter Gershon | 2/2 3        |\n| Jonathan Dawson       | 10/10        | Earl Shipp      | 9/10 1       | Nicola Shaw       | 4/4 3        |\n| Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Esperdy       | 10/10        | Jonathan Silver | 9/10 1       | Paul Golby        | 4/4 3        |\n| Liz Hewitt            | 9/10 1       | Tony Wood       | 4/4 2        | Mark Williamson   | 8/8 3        |\n\n- Board Chair\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## How the Board monitors culture\n\nThe Board plays a significant role in monitoring and assessing both the culture of the Group and its alignment with the Company's purpose, values and strategy.\n\nThe People & Governance Committee also plays a key role in keeping momentum in relation to management development and succession. This year, focus has been on executive development in particular. Although not all Board members sit on the People & Governance Committee, they have access to all Committee papers and regularly attend the People & Governance Committee meetings. The Chair reports back to the full Board following each meeting, which also provides the opportunity for full Board input and to ensure it is monitoring culture effectively.\n\nThere has been a vast amount of change both within the organisation and externally over the last few years. The importance of creating the right culture throughout the Company, to ensure our colleagues are embracing positive and inclusive behaviours and values in everything we do, has never been more important.\n\nThe Board assesses the Company's culture and/uni00A0the progress being made from two key data/uni00A0sources:\n\n- \u00b7  lagging indicators from the Grid:voice survey and the Spencer Stuart culture diagnostic; and\n- \u00b7  leading indicators taken from the culture change activity underway across the/uni00A0organisation.\n\nThe full Board joined the People & Governance Committee to discuss with Spencer Stuart matters including the context, backgrounds and updates to the work that the Company had been undertaking to identify and cultivate senior talent. The full Board reviewed the assessments undertaken against the methodology used to assess the talent pipelines.\n\n## Grid:voice employee survey\n\nOur Grid:voice survey this year provided a set of/uni00A0strong results, with improvements in a number of areas including the 'Safe to Say' scores, which are six points higher than the high performing norm. This has demonstrated that there is an open culture within the organisation where individuals feel that they are able to express their views, opinions and concerns. The Board also monitors areas that are not as strong performing as others and tracks progress. Consideration in the year was also given to WPD's results, the first year that these had been included. There is focus required in this area to work to align the results with the rest of the organisation and the Board will monitor to ensure progress is achieved.\n\nThe biggest impact on colleague engagement and culture is line managers and the tone that is set from the top of the organisation. Recognising this, the Company's 'leadership index' sets expectations for leadership behaviour, and provides actionable insight for leaders to focus development that has a positive impact on their immediate team. 2022 was the third full 'leadership index' that has been created and demonstrated positive progress with a reduction in the number of leaders scoring below our target levels. This has highlighted the positive and significant impact our individual leaders across the organisation can have on their own/uni00A0behaviour.\n\n## Culture diagnostic\n\nThe culture diagnostic work has shown a clear shift towards our desired culture and in particular indicated that the characteristic of 'Caution' had moved downwards and 'Purpose' had moved upwards, demonstrating a significant step forward over the last 12 months. The strongest culture traits for the Group are now 'Purpose', 'Caring' and 'Order'.\n\n## Leading indicators of change\n\nIn addition to the quantitative data, the Board also monitors leading indicators of change. Throughout the year this has been through the results of the organisation's 'Living our Values Everyday' campaign, 'Untapped AI' personal development coaching activity and through the 'Team Effectiveness' facilitation programme.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOur culture diagnostic work will continue to progress with the next goal in this area to move the characteristics of 'Results' further up and move 'Order' down. The/uni00A0challenge will be to maintain the changes made around 'Purpose' and 'Caution', whilst focusing organisation-wide and everyday action change on becoming more 'Customer' and 'Performance' orientated. The Board will continue to spend considerable time on culture/uni00A0and monitor the progress in this area.\n\nOne of the Board's goals for 2022/23 is to ensure laser-like focus is on management succession, including a focus on continuous culture improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information on culture, please see page/uni00A065.\n\nMembers of the Board visited the IFA interconnector site at Sellindge in March 2022. Following a catastrophic fire at the site in September 2021, the Board and Committees have had oversight of the investigation into the root cause. The site visit consisted of a tour of the facility and an overview of the damage and reparations. It/uni00A0also provided the opportunity for Board members to hear directly from employees and contractors on site.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance overview continued\n\n## Board engagement\n\nEngagement is key to the Group's long-term success and the Board directly and indirectly engages with key stakeholders, ensuring it understands their interests and takes them into account in Board decision making. You can read the Board's section 172(1) statement on page 56.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThroughout the year we continued with our 'Full/uni00A0Board Employee Voice' approach, utilising and enhancing existing colleague engagement methods and communication channels to ensure meaningful engagement across all locations. The/uni00A0programme, overseen by the People & Governance Committee, monitors the effectiveness of the programme and reviews the/uni00A0chosen mechanism under the Code at least annually. The variety of engagement is a great way of building and maintaining trust and communication whilst providing our people with/uni00A0an appropriate forum to influence change.\n\nIn the year we shared a selection of short videos of our new Non-executive Directors with our colleagues to help familiarise them with their/uni00A0Board.\n\n## Board engagement programme\n\nSmall sessions These sessions make up the majority of the Board engagement programme in/uni00A0the year. They consist of around 10 individuals in attendance and a different subset of Board members. Attendees are coordinated by HR and are diverse across our workforce. Some of the sessions are open discussion with no set agenda whilst others have recommended topics; for example, in May 2022, our employees discussed our Climate Transition Plan and the new Remuneration Policy ahead of these going to/uni00A0the AGM for shareholder vote.\n\n## Employee Resource Groups (ERG) and\n\nhigh-potential employees The Chair met with/uni00A0multiple ERG leads and participated in a/uni00A0'learning from leaders' session with the 'Women in National Grid' (WING) ERG. Our/uni00A0high-potential employees also had the opportunity to meet with the Board and share their views. This was a great opportunity for the/uni00A0Board to meet our high-potential employees informally and reconfirmed the need to actively support their career development, a topic very/uni00A0much on the People & Governance Committee's agenda for the year ahead.\n\nVirtual 'town hall' Our Chair and CEO hosted/uni00A0a/uni00A0virtual town hall in January 2022 with/uni00A0a/uni00A0cross-section of the US workforce. Discussions included community engagement, diversity and inclusion, the clean energy transition and gas supply. This was one of the first opportunities for some of our colleagues to meet our Chair since she had been in role.\n\nCommittee focused These included an Audit/uni00A0& Risk Committee virtual session in January 2022 with US finance colleagues and/uni00A0a/uni00A0Finance Committee discussion with colleagues from the Pension, Tax, Financial Planning and Treasury teams in July/uni00A02021.\n\nEngineering dinner Earl Shipp and Tony Wood attended a dinner in March 2022 to recognise engineers involved in world-leading Energy Transition projects including T-Pylons, the/uni00A0UK's new nuclear power station and the Storm Eunice response. The event provided the opportunity for individuals to discuss a range of/uni00A0topics including SF6, engineering capability and the strategic direction taken by the Board.\n\nSite visits It was really positive for Directors\n\nto/uni00A0be able to get back out on site following the COVID-19 pandemic, and this year saw optional visits scheduled around Board meetings. These/uni00A0vital engagement forums provided the opportunity for smaller groups of the Board to hear views from and see the workforce in action and included the IFA interconnector at Sellindge, the London Power Tunnels and WPD's control/uni00A0centre.\n\n## Feedback and decision making\n\nFollowing all engagement, the Board takes the time to discuss the views of the workforce and takes these into consideration throughout wider Board discussions, a topic on each Board agenda going forward. Following feedback in the external Board evaluation this year, a set of 'ground rules' were/uni00A0re-established by the Board to increase transparency around engagement and to ensure that following any non-scheduled engagement events, views heard are captured and reported back to the boardroom or the CEO/CFO, where/uni00A0appropriate.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe People & Governance Committee reviewed/uni00A0the engagement mechanism at its/uni00A0March 2022 meeting and agreed that the current approach remained the most appropriate mechanism. The variety of sessions provides a/uni00A0valuable link between our colleagues and the Directors, and we look forward to hearing more from our employees this year. As the world and priorities continue to evolve, we will continue to keep the overall approach under review and updated and refined as required.\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining good communications with existing and potential shareholders. The Company has a comprehensive investor relations programme where a range of/uni00A0key investors are met with in person or virtually at/uni00A0small meetings and larger investor roadshow/uni00A0events. The Board Chair also engages with large shareholders and the Remuneration Committee Chair engages specifically on remuneration practices.\n\nManagement also hosts webcasts for both our/uni00A0half-year and full-year results and takes questions from investors and analysts to ensure an open dialogue with the market. Presentations given to/uni00A0analysts and investors covering the Group's results, along with all results and other regulatory announcements as well as further information for/uni00A0investors, are included on the investor relations section of our website at nationalgrid.com/investors .\n\nFurther information on our engagement with our retail shareholders is set out on page 97 under Annual and General Meetings of shareholders.\n\nCapital Markets Day In November 2021 we hosted our first Capital Markets Day. This was a/uni00A0hybrid event giving investors the opportunity to/uni00A0engage online or in person with key members of the Group Executive Committee and National Grid leaders. As part of this, we held a number of 'teach in' sessions to support investors' knowledge of our business units and key strategy areas for the Group. The Capital Markets Day videos are on our website at nationalgrid.com/investors.\n\n'Grid Guide to...' Throughout the year our investor series continued. The series consists of/uni00A0short, virtual sessions covering our ambitions and progress across a range of ESG themes. Some of the key sessions of the 2021/22 programme included:\n\n- \u00b7  May 2021 - Grid Guide to...

        "page_content": "## Annual and General Meetings of shareholders\n\nIn April 2021, we held a General Meeting to seek approval from our shareholders for the acquisition of WPD. We also announced our intention to sell a majority stake in UK Gas Transmission and the sale of NECO at this time. This meeting took place behind closed doors due to COVID-19 restrictions; however, shareholders were invited to submit questions in advance of the meeting and were answered in a/uni00A0shareholder webcast. In/uni00A0July 2021, our Annual General Meeting (AGM) took place in London. We also facilitated the ability for shareholders to view the meeting remotely, register and ask any questions both in person or virtually. Voting levels were largely consistent with previous years, despite the disruption caused by COVID-19 restrictions in place. All resolutions were passed at the meeting in line with the Board's recommendations.\n\nThe pandemic has clearly demonstrated the efficiency of virtual and hybrid meetings and allows for greater levels of engagement and participation by individuals. A resolution to/uni00A0amend our Articles of Association to allow for/uni00A0hybrid AGMs was approved in 2021. Our 2022 AGM in July will be conducted in the hybrid format.\n\nThe Notice convening the 2022 AGM will be made available to shareholders in advance of the meeting. This will provide shareholders with the appropriate time to consider matters. The results of the proxy votes on each resolution will be collated independently by the Company's registrar and will be published on the Company's website after the meeting.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive investor relations programme throughout the year. Please visit our website to keep up to date as events are announced at nationalgrid.com/investors. Materials from recent seminars and access to/uni00A0our educational videos and podcasts can also/uni00A0be found/uni00A0online and on our social media/uni00A0channels.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n## 2021/22 external Board/uni00A0evaluation\n\nOur annual evaluation provides the Board and its/uni00A0Committees with an opportunity to consider and reflect on the quality and effectiveness of their decision making, and for each member to/uni00A0consider their own contribution and performance. In accordance with the Code, which outlines in the Provisions that the Company should undertake an externally facilitated evaluation every three years, the 2021/22 Board evaluation was conducted externally. In May 2021, National Grid engaged Independent Board Evaluation (IBE) to facilitate this year's Board evaluation.\n\nFollowing initial briefings in October 2021, the evaluation began with Board and Committee observations in November 2021. This was supplemented with Director and management interviews. Results were fed back to the Chair in/uni00A0December 2021 and then presented to the Board in January 2022. The Board agreed the set of actions outlined below in March 2022.\n\nNational Grid confirms neither the principal consultant nor IBE has any connection with the/uni00A0Company, individual Directors nor the Company Secretary.\n\n## Findings of the Board evaluation\n\nThe Board has been through significant change Findings of the evaluation take into account the\n\nover the past year, as noted in the evaluation. appointment of a new Chair with effect from 31 May 2021 and a/uni00A0number of changes amongst the Non-executive Directors. The/uni00A0Board views these changes as positive. The/uni00A0review noted that National Grid is underpinned by robust governance and compliance. Succession planning, culture and strategy were identified as key areas of focus for/uni00A0the year ahead, with opportunity for Board materials to be further streamlined.\n\n## Board Committees' effectiveness\n\nEach Board Committee was included as part of/uni00A0the evaluation and each Committee received a/uni00A0detailed report. IBE noted that the Committee structure had also been through a period of change, which has refocused the remit of each Committee. The Chair has engaged on feedback with each Committee Chair and, following the Board agreeing its action plan and goals in March 2022, each Committee will set an outline of key areas of focus for 2022/23.\n\n## Performance of the Chair\n\nAs part of IBE's evaluation, in line with the Code, each individual Director's effectiveness was evaluated, including our Chair's performance. Detailed feedback was shared directly with the Senior Independent Director, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Esperdy. An overview of the findings was shared during a/uni00A0private session between Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Paula. The Board recognised in its feedback that Paula had led the Board effectively during a period of significant change whilst outlining vital key strategic priorities for the business.\n\n| Focus area Board actions for 2022/23                                                                                                                                                             |                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| \u00b7  Finalise Board strategic topics for 2022/23 and ensure agendas align.                                                                                                                         | Strategy                        |\n| \u00b7  Strengthen focus on talent and succession at all levels.

Member of the Nominations Committee until 1 September 2021.\n- 3.   Became a member of the Committee on appointment to the Company on 1 September/uni00A02021.\n\n## Year in review\n\nOn appointment, I requested Justine Campbell, Group General Counsel & Company Secretary to/uni00A0undertake a full review of the appropriateness of the Board Committee structure, terms of reference for the respective committees and overall effectiveness. The outcome of that review/uni00A0was to update the remits of the various committees. Notably, the Safety, Environment and Health Committee was repurposed as the Safety & Sustainability Committee, the Audit Committee as the Audit & Risk Committee and the Nominations Committee was repurposed as the People & Governance Committee. All were with effect from 1 September 2021. With respect to the latter Committee, the subject of this letter, let me simply restate the obvious: people make all the difference. So we formed a committee that looked not just at the process of governance but its content. To read further about the Committee refresh and governance framework, see page 90.\n\n## Board composition\n\nSir Peter Gershon, our prior chair, was kind/uni00A0enough to appoint me to chair of the Nominations Committee when I joined the Board in January 2021. Having the opportunity to chair both this Committee and the Board allows for me/uni00A0to ensure there is alignment across our governance practices and to ensure robust oversight of succession. Sir Peter recognised that the Board would have quite a bit of turnover in membership due to a substantial number of directors reaching the limits of their terms and that I/uni00A0should be the one leading the process of identifying new directors. In the year we recruited a number of new directors from diverse backgrounds and experiences, four of whom were seated earlier in the financial year and/uni00A0one who will join the Board ahead of this AGM. All Board members participated in the recruitment and it was encouraging how much agreement there was as/uni00A0to the talent we needed. There was also a/uni00A0unanimity of view/uni00A0that we were seeking seasoned senior professionals who were confident in their capabilities, independent in their thought processes, curious about our business, and invested in a commitment to a/uni00A0net/uni00A0zero future. Collectively, they bring vitality and energy to the boardroom, gracefully balancing support and challenge. Because such a large cohort of directors has come on board at/uni00A0one time, we will/uni00A0seek to stagger terms so that we don't encounter the same 'cliff' of retirements in the future as we experienced this/uni00A0year.\n\n## Management development and/uni00A0succession\n\nIn my first meeting as Board Chair, we began by exploring what were the most important things we needed to accomplish as a Board. From that/uni00A0discussion, we adopted goals for our work. One area that stood out was the need for a more robust process of reviewing management development and executive succession, a key responsibility of this Committee. We worked with our Chief Executive to review the succession pipeline for many of the key roles in the Company, to discuss development plans to our\n\nemerging leaders, and to identify where we need to introduce new skills and experience into the organisation. In its first year, the Committee has focused on executive development in particular. However, we have also reviewed the results of the culture survey, reviewed the demographics of/uni00A0our workforce and turnover, and used our engagement sessions to learn more about the temperament and issues of the wider workforce.\n\nIn line with our expanded remit, the Committee considered our workforce engagement mechanism and agreed to continue with our chosen method of enhancing existing Board engagement sessions. We discuss the learnings of these engagement sessions at every Board meeting, discussing whether we have the pulse of the organisation. We also have a schedule for/uni00A0the year to ensure we are meeting with organisations on both sides of the Atlantic, in/uni00A0offices, depots, and on the front line. At year/uni00A0end, the Committee considered whether these small and larger engagements remain appropriate and effective for us to stay in touch with all levels of the organisation and at this time we are agreed that they do; however, we will continue to challenge and review effectiveness in/uni00A0this area. See pages 96-97 for an overview of/uni00A0Board engagement activity through the/uni00A0year.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)\n\nIn 2021, the Company appointed its first senior executive with a remit specifically tied to diversity and inclusion. Natalie Edwards, our Global Chief Diversity Officer, has met with us to review the global DEI strategy, which includes a/uni00A0clear set of/uni00A0DEI commitments which will provide clarity and direction for the organisation. The work of the team in engaging with the workforce has been exemplary and we anticipate having Natalie meet with us frequently given the importance of this agenda. We also welcome the/uni00A0FCA's new listing rule requirements around diversity and inclusion reporting. These will apply for our next year's report; however I'm happy to/uni00A0report that/uni00A0we are already in compliance with these/uni00A0measures.\n\n## Culture and accountability\n\nHigh-performing organisations are characterised by, among other things, clarity on goals and performance. To this end, the Board had an/uni00A0independent consultant review our board effectiveness and gather feedback on each of us/uni00A0as a contributor. Through this process, we are seeking to model the very culture that we seek to strengthen in the organisation. We/uni00A0are actively engaged with the Remuneration Committee and the Board as a whole in ensuring/uni00A0that there are clear objectives for the organisation and leaders so that we both monitor progress and measure outcomes. See page 95 to read more about how/uni00A0we as a Board monitor the culture of the/uni00A0Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaula Rosput Reynolds Committee Chair",

We/uni00A0currently have 33% female direct reports  to/uni00A0the CEO. |\n| The Board aspires to meet and ultimately exceed  the Parker Review target for FTSE 100 boards to  have at least one Director from a non-white  ethnic minority by 2021. | We currently have two Directors from  a/uni00A0non-white ethnic minority.                                                                                            |\n| The Board aspires to achieve 50% diversity*  on/uni00A0the Board.                                                                                                       | We currently have 54% diversity on the Board.                                                                                                                        |\n\n- * Diversity of the Board is defined, in this context, as female and non-white ethnic minorities.\n\nOur Policy determines that:\n\n- \u00b7  all Board appointments and succession plans are made on merit and objective criteria, in the context of the skills and experience that are needed for the Board to be effective and to guard against 'group think';\n- \u00b7  we will only engage executive search firms who have signed up to the UK Voluntary Code of Conduct on Gender Diversity; and\n- \u00b7  we will continue to make key diversity data, both about the Board and our wider employee population, available in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nIn the year, the Committee will review the Policy and associated objectives to consider if these remain appropriate and update as necessary to ensure these remain relevant and stretching. Report on progress against our objectives (as set out above) will continue to be outlined in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nExamples of the initiatives to support inclusion and diversity throughout our Company are set out/uni00A0on/uni00A0page 66.\n\n## Appointments, skills and the talent pipeline\n\nThe Board has a wide range of skills and experience and considers this when appointing new Directors. Skills such as ESG and climate change have been given greater focus in recent years to/uni00A0reflect the evolving strategy of the Company. The graph to the side provides an overview of the breadth of skills and experience currently on the Board. The Committee took account of these, as/uni00A0well as level of experience required and diversity, when considering appointments in the year. The/uni00A0appointments of Ian, Tony, Martha and Anne followed a transparent and thorough process, outlined/uni00A0below.\n\n- \u00b7  Russell Reynold Associates and MWM Consulting were appointed jointly as the search firm for each appointment made throughout the year. There are no connections between the search firms, the Company and its individual directors. They reviewed our requirements and developed specific criteria for candidate selection alongside the requirement for broader Non-executive Director characteristic requirements, including deep engineering expertise, transformational experience and strong credentials in the future of energy and ESG considerations.\n- \u00b7  Individual role profiles were created and a short list of candidates presented for consideration to the Chair of the People & Governance Committee.\n- \u00b7  Preferred candidates met with members of the Board, who reported back to the People & Governance Committee.\n- \u00b7  Leading candidates were identified and the People & Governance Committee recommended these for approval by the Board.\n\nThe Committee discussed the talent pipeline regularly, giving focus to ensuring development opportunities also reached further into the organisation and identified those less advanced in their careers but with long-term potential. A Future Leaders Programme was highlighted to the Committee and would be built into the regular talent updates. The programme focuses on less senior colleagues, enabling a wider group of potential future talent to enjoy a structured development programme, using digital tools as well as tailored support.\n\nAt senior management level, the Committee approved the appointment of Ben Wilson as Chief Strategy & External Affairs Officer, Stephen Woerner as President, New England, and Will Serle, who joined the Company as Chief People & Culture Officer. Phil Swift also joined with the integration of WPD as President, WPD. All four individuals joined the Group Executive Committee. Alison Kay, interim Chief Strategy & External Affairs Officer, Andy Doyle, Chief People & Culture Officer; and Badar Khan, President, US, stepped down in the year.",

Ian Livingston and Jonathan Silver joined the Committee effective 1 September 2021.\n- 2. Paul Golby was unable to attend the additional Committee meeting on 6 July 2021 due to a prior commitment and stepped down from the Board effective 26 July 2021.\n\n## Committee financial experience\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the Chair, as a/uni00A0chartered accountant with significant board-level financial and audit experience, is suitably qualified and has recent and relevant financial experience. The Committee as/uni00A0a/uni00A0whole is deemed to have competence relevant to the sector in which the Company operates.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee was satisfied that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the/uni00A0necessary information for shareholders to/uni00A0assess/uni00A0the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy. This/uni00A0was recommended to the/uni00A0Board at its meeting in May 2022.\n\n## Statement of Compliance with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) Order\n\nThe Company confirms that it has complied with/uni00A0The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use/uni00A0of/uni00A0Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 (Article 7.1), including with respect to the Audit & Risk Committee's responsibilities for agreeing the audit scope and fees and authorising non-audit services.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe work of the Audit & Risk Committee has/uni00A0never been more important: investors, regulators and other stakeholders require ever more informative and reliable reporting, not just of the results and financial position, but of resilience, risk management and the Company's environmental, social and governance (ESG) position and progress. The Committee also oversees and evaluates the Company's approach and controls relating to the prevention/uni00A0and detection of fraud and bribery, including overseeing the effectiveness of whistleblowing mechanisms.\n\nIn September 2021, the Committee's remit was/uni00A0expanded to have an increased delegation from the Board in relation to risk. We have spent significant time updating the reporting cadence of risk matters, working closely with the Chief Risk Officer to support effective oversight of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Company's principal, emerging and child/uni00A0risks and associated enterprise riskmanagement processes.\n\n## Review of the year\n\nI'm delighted to be writing to you following my/uni00A0first full financial year as Audit & Risk Committee Chair.\n\nDuring the year, we met four times as part of the/uni00A0standard schedule of Committee meetings. After the virtual world we endured in 2020/21, it/uni00A0was great to be able to meet in person again. Following the public announcement of the federal investigations into allegations of fraud and bribery by former National Grid employees in our US business, the Committee met four extra times in the year to provide oversight of the/uni00A0internal investigations. We also endorsed management broadening the scope of its investigations to receive assurance that the now substantiated allegations of fraud and bribery were isolated incidents and National Grid's controls are appropriate and continue to operate/uni00A0effectively to mitigate future instances.\n\nThe Committee also received updates on the successful go-live of the new enterprise resource planning (ERP) and general ledger system in the UK and we continued our oversight of ESG reporting and assurance matters. In particular, we have discussed the rapid market and regulatory developments in this space and management's strategies to respond to these/uni00A0changes.\n\nIt is vital that the Committee goes the extra mile/uni00A0by spending additional time on significant matters that present themselves each year. Nonetheless, we must ensure a laser-like focus on regulatory and compliance matters within our/uni00A0remit. We maintain an extensive and detailed agenda focusing on the audit, compliance and risk processes within the Company, working closely with management, the external auditor, Corporate Audit and the Finance and Legal teams. Key matters of business considered during/uni00A0the year are set out on page 103.\n\n## Engagement\n\nIn October 2021, we had a roundtable session giving Committee members the opportunity to engage with key management personnel in the UK and US, and this doubled as an induction session for Jonathan and Ian, whom I was glad to welcome to the Committee. We also held a/uni00A0virtual question and answer session with members of the US Finance, Risk and Global Internal Audit teams in January 2022. We are looking forward to returning to the US later in 2022 when I hope to host a similar in-person session. These were key parts of the wider stakeholder engagement focus for the Board which is detailed on pages/uni00A096-97.\n\n## Transactions\n\nWe have performed an active role monitoring the progress of the various transactions across the Group. We received regular updates relating to the integration of WPD's financial reporting and risk and controls framework into the Group and we had an informative session with the CEO and CFO of WPD in November 2021, who provided an overview of the business. We were regularly kept up to date on the Company's strategic portfolio transactions, including updates from management in relation to the accounting issues/uni00A0linked to the UK Gas/uni00A0Transmission (NGG) and NECO sales.\n\n## Thank you\n\nI would like to thank Committee members, the/uni00A0management team and Deloitte for their commitment throughout an extremely busy year and for their contribution, support and integrity provided in support of the Committee's work. A/uni00A0sincere thank you must go to Doug King, who has completed his fifth and final statutory audit for National Grid. He has been a pleasure to work with and we are extremely grateful for his constructive challenge and professionalism over the past five years.\n\nLiz Hewitt Committee Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee challenged the reasonableness of the duration of the cash flow forecast used  in/uni00A0the test and reviewed the key assumptions, including the cash flows, discount rate and terminal value. The Committee also  received Deloitte's audit conclusions over both the impairment work and the execution of management's impairment SOX  controls. The Committee concluded that the judgements taken and estimates made by management were supportable and  should be disclosed as areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty. |\n| Proposed disposal  of/uni00A0a majority stake  in/uni00A0the UK Gas  Transmission  business | \u00b7  During the year, the Committee oversaw the judgements and accounting for the proposed sale of a majority stake in UK Gas  Transmission. In/uni00A0particular, the Committee reviewed management's judgement on the date the business qualified as held for  sale and a/uni00A0discontinued operation. Based upon management's analysis versus the criteria outlined in IFRS 5, the Committee  was satisfied the judgement was appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Useful life of gas  assets in the context  of climate change                                | \u00b7  Consistent with prior years, the Committee reviewed and concurred with management's judgement that, notwithstanding the  regulatory and legislative commitments to net zero in the jurisdictions that we operate in, there will be a role for our gas  networks beyond 2050 in a range of possible scenarios and that nothing suggests that our gas asset lives should be  shortened at this point. The Committee also agreed with management that the additional disclosures and sensitivities  previously added to the notes to the financial statements should be retained, along with the disclosures of the matter as a key  judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty.                                         |\n| Application of the  Group's Exceptional  Items Framework                                    | \u00b7  In March 2022, the Committee approved revisions to the Group's Exceptional Items Framework (Framework) to include  a/uni00A0disclosure section, reflecting the latest guidance and recommendations from the FRC following its October 2021 Thematic  Review into Alternative Performance Measures. This update also reflected transactions that had occurred since the previous  update to the Framework in September 2020.  \u00b7  Throughout the year, the Committee considered papers from management setting out how the Framework had been applied  to certain events and transactions over the period, as set out in Note 5 to the financial statements.                                                                    |\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n## Going concern and viability\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Group's going concern statement, viability statement (as set out on/uni00A0page 153 and pages 33-35 respectively) and the supporting assessment reports prepared by management. During 2021/22, there has been continued review of the Group's viability and going concern with support of the Finance Committee. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis such that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operation for at least 12 months from the date of signing the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Statutory reporting framework policy\n\nThe Board has responsibility for effective management of risk for the Group including determining its risk appetite, identifying key strategic and emerging risks, and reviewing the risk management and internal control framework. The Committee, in supporting the Board to assess the effectiveness of risk management and internal control processes, relies on a number of Company-specific internal control mechanisms to support the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts and the financial reporting process. This includes both the Board and Committees receiving regular management reports to/uni00A0include analysis of results, forecasts and comparisons with last year's results, and/uni00A0assurance from the external auditor.\n\nWith the regulatory environment evolving quickly, the Committee is kept fully informed of all new legislation, FRC advice and best practice and/uni00A0the requirements of the Code and Disclosure and Transparency Rules. During 2021/22, the Committee has been kept up/uni00A0to/uni00A0date with changes to legislation and regulatory reviews and has had oversight of the potential impacts.\n\nThe Committee and Board receive, in advance of/uni00A0the full-year results, a periodic SOX report on management's opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. This report concerns the Group-wide programme to/uni00A0comply with the requirements of SOX and is received directly from the/uni00A0Group SOX and Controls team.\n\nIn relation to the financial statements, the Company has specific internal mechanisms that govern the financial reporting process and the preparation of/uni00A0the Annual Report and Accounts. The Committee oversees that the Company provides accurate, timely financial results and implements accounting standards and judgements effectively, including in relation to/uni00A0going concern and viability. Our financial processes include a range of system, transactional and management oversight controls. Our businesses prepare detailed monthly management reports that include analysis of their results, along with comparisons to relevant budgets, forecasts and the previous year's results. Monthly business reviews, attended by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), supplement these reports. Each month, the CFO presents a consolidated financial report to the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Audit & Risk Committee report continued\n\n## Risk management and internal/uni00A0control\n\n## Risk management\n\nRisk management is the responsibility of the Board and is key to achieving our strategic priorities. The system of risk management is established by the Board, which sets risk appetite and maintains the system of internal controls to manage risk within the Group. The/uni00A0Audit & Risk Committee has delegated responsibility from the Board for the oversight of the Group's systems of internal control and risk management. This includes policies, compliance, legislation including compliance with SOX and the UK Bribery Act 2010, appropriateness of financial disclosures, procedures, business conduct and internal audit. As part of the framework across the Group, National Grid's values - 'do the right thing', 'find a better way' and 'make it happen' - continue to communicate and promote a culture of integrity across the Group. During the year, the Board reviewed the principal risks facing the Group (as/uni00A0set out on pages 28 - 32). The Committee provided oversight and reviewed the risk management process to ensure that processes are in place to/uni00A0manage risk appropriately.\n\n## Internal control and risk management/uni00A0effectiveness\n\nWe continually monitor the effectiveness of our internal control and risk management processes to make sure they continue to be effective, robust and remain fit for purpose. Controls are in/uni00A0place to reduce either the likelihood or impact of any risk once it has occurred. Following the/uni00A0review over the year the Committee recommended to the Board that the processes/uni00A0had the correct authority, expertise and independence and provided sufficient assurance/uni00A0to the Company.\n\nThis review includes financial, operational and/uni00A0compliance controls. The Committee also monitors and addresses any business conduct issues or compliance issues. The Certificate of/uni00A0Assurance (CoA) process operates via a/uni00A0cascade system and takes place annually in/uni00A0support of the Company's full-year results.\n\nThe Company has a Chief Risk Officer who leads on the Group's risk management processes. Corporate Audit also supports the Group's risk management and internal control processes. They maintain an independent and objective approach to evaluate and enhance process developments. The Global Head of Audit appointment is a matter reserved for the Committee and has responsibility for the internal audit function, attends all Committee meetings and has access to the Committee Chair as/uni00A0necessary.\n\nAt each of the Committee's meetings, progress of the internal audit process is reviewed including significant outstanding actions. The Committee also has regular private meetings with the Global Head of Audit. The Committee notes timelines and where actions are overdue, challenges these. Corporate Audit is responsible for developing the audit plan including engaging in major change programmes across the business.\n\nThe Committee Chair signed the updated Corporate Audit Charter in December 2021 following agreement from the Audit & Risk Committee and Safety & Sustainability Committee in November 2021 and December 2021 respectively. The Committee also received the results of the Internal Quality Assessment that took place in 2021/22.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing the/uni00A0relationship with the external auditor. The Committee Chair meets with the external auditor prior to each meeting and outside the meeting cycle on a/uni00A0regular basis.\n\n- \u00b7  Deloitte is the external auditor to the/uni00A0Company.\n- \u00b7  Appointed in 2017 following a formal tender/uni00A0process.\n- \u00b7  Reappointed at the 2021 AGM for the year/uni00A0ended 31 March 2022.\n- \u00b7  The Committee was authorised by shareholders to set Deloitte's remuneration at/uni00A0the 2021 AGM.\n- \u00b7  Current lead Audit Partner is Doug King and/uni00A02021/22 was the fifth and final year of/uni00A0his/uni00A0term.\n\nChris Thomas has been selected as Doug/uni00A0King's successor and will oversee the statutory audit for 2022/23. The Committee has/uni00A0spent significant time with both Doug and Chris during 2021/22 to make sure the succession is/uni00A0seamless; this included Chris attending a number of Committee meetings in the year alongside Doug.\n\nFollowing consideration of the auditor's independence and objectivity, the audit quality/uni00A0and the auditor's performance, the Committee was satisfied with the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of Deloitte and recommended to the Board its reappointment for the year ended 31 March 2023.\n\nA resolution to reappoint Deloitte and give authority to the Committee to determine its remuneration will be submitted to/uni00A0shareholders at the 2022 AGM. In accordance with the CMA Order Article 4, the Committee believes that a/uni00A0competitive tender no later than 2026 is in the/uni00A0best interests of the Company given the independence, objectivity and performance of Deloitte to date and to ensure the appropriate time and planning required to execute a/uni00A0comprehensive tender process. This approach is in line with current regulation that requires a/uni00A0tender every 10 years.\n\n## Effectiveness, quality and performance\n\nAs part of the Committee's responsibilities, consideration is regularly given to the effectiveness of the external auditor to verify that/uni00A0the quality, challenge and output of the external audit process is sufficient. Throughout the year the Committee also looks at the quality of the auditor's reports and considers its response to accounting, financial control and audit issues as they arise. To maintain high levels/uni00A0of quality the Committee reviews and challenges, where appropriate, the external audit/uni00A0plan prior to approval.\n\n## Audit quality reports received by the Committee\n\n## External auditor Insights Report\n\nOn an annual basis, the Committee receives a/uni00A0report summarising the financial reporting and/or internal control areas that, based on the results of the most recent audit, Deloitte considers management should prioritise during the/uni00A0year ahead. This year, the report included management's responses to the/uni00A0recommendations, along with an update on prior year recommendations.\n\n## Management survey\n\nManagement undertook a survey in FY22 that sought views from over 100 key stakeholders involved in the external audit/uni00A0process across the/uni00A0Company. The questions comprised of the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7  The external auditor's performance; key/uni00A0performance indicators included:\n- -  planning and scope;\n- -  robustness of the audit process;\n- -  independence and objectivity;\n- -  quality of delivery;\n- -  quality of people and service; and\n- -  understanding of the Company.\n- \u00b7   National Grid's commitment to the/uni00A0audit.\n\nManagement, the external auditor, and/uni00A0the Committee discussed the results of the survey, which showed that the external auditor's score had remained consistent with the prior year. Deloitte agreed to put in place an action plan for/uni00A0areas of improvement.\n\nIn March 2022, the Committee received the FRC's Audit Quality Review Inspection Report of Deloitte for the audit of the Company's financial statements for 2020/21. The Committee noted there were no key findings from the review and three areas of good practice highlighted by the/uni00A0FRC.\n\nThe Committee also regularly engages and receives the views of senior management and/uni00A0members of the Finance team in forming conclusions on auditor effectiveness.\n\nMeetings are held around each scheduled Committee meeting between Committee members and the external auditor, without management being present to encourage open and transparent feedback. This additional time outside of the formal meeting environment helps us to monitor the independence, quality and effectiveness of the external audit functions.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7  reviewed the quality of audit planning, including approach, scope, progress and level of fees;\n- \u00b7  reviewed the outcome of recommendations from the Deloitte Insights Report;",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7  held private meetings with Deloitte without management present;\n- \u00b7  held meetings with the UK Partner and US/uni00A0Partner;\n- \u00b7  confirmed that the Deloitte external audit process had been delivered effectively; and\n- \u00b7  met with, and approved the appointment of, and transition plan for, Chris Thomas, the new lead Audit Partner who will take over for the 2022/23 audit year.\n\n## Auditor independence and objectivity\n\nThe independence of the external auditor is essential to the provision of an objective opinion on the true and fair view presented in the financial statements.\n\nThe Committee considered the safeguards in/uni00A0place, including the annual review by Corporate Audit, to assess the external auditor's independence. The external auditor reported to/uni00A0the Committee in May 2022 that it had considered its independence in relation to the audit and confirmed that it complies with UK regulatory and professional requirements, SEC regulations and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards and that its/uni00A0objectivity is not compromised. The Committee took this into account when considering the external auditor's independence and concluded that Deloitte continued to be independent for the purposes of the external audit and confirmed that this recommendation was free from third-party influence and restrictive contractual clauses.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn line with the FRC's Ethical Standard and to maintain the external auditor's objectivity and independence, we have a policy governing Deloitte's provision of non-audit services.\n\nThe cap on the total fees that may be paid to the/uni00A0external auditor for non-audit services in any/uni00A0given year is 70% of the average audit fees paid in the last three financial years.\n\nThe provision of any non-audit service by the external auditor requires prior approval. A subset of services where, due to their nature, we believe there is no threat to the auditor's independence or objectivity qualify as pre-approved. These services must have a value under \u00a3250,000 (increased by Committee approval during the year from \u00a350,000) and be reviewed in advance by the CFO. These services are/uni00A0limited to:\n\n- \u00b7  audit, review or attest services. These are services that generally only the external auditor can provide, in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. They include comfort letters, statutory audits, attest services, consents and assistance with review/uni00A0of filing documents; and\n- \u00b7  other areas, such as provision of access to/uni00A0technical publications.\n\nManagement presents a list of all non-audit work/uni00A0requests to the Committee to ensure the Committee is monitoring all non-audit services provided. Non-audit service approvals during 2021/22 principally related to comfort letters for/uni00A0debt issuances and refreshes of debt issuance programmes.\n\n## External auditor fees\n\nThe amounts payable to the external auditor, Deloitte, in the past two years were:\n\n## Statutory auditor's fees (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal billed non-audit services provided by Deloitte during the year ended 31 March 2022 were \u00a31.0 million, representing 5% of total audit and non-audit fees. In 2020/21, non-audit services totalled \u00a32.8 million (14% of total audit and non-audit fees).\n\nFurther information on the fees paid to Deloitte for audit, audit-related and other services is provided in Note 4 to the financial statements on/uni00A0page 162.\n\nTotal audit and audit-related fees include the statutory fee and fees paid to Deloitte for other services that the external auditor is required to perform, such as regulatory audits and SOX attestation. Non-audit fees represent all non-statutory services provided by Deloitte.",

Mark Williamson joined the Committee effective 1 September 2021 and stepped down from the Board effective 31 December 2021.\n- 4.   Paul Golby stepped down from the Board effective 26 July 2021.\n\n## Review of the year\n\nI'm pleased to present to you my first report as Chair of the Safety & Sustainability Committee. After a review undertaken earlier in 2021, we refreshed our remit. In addition to health and safety, we agreed to increase monitoring of sustainability-related issues including external climate-related disclosure requirements. You'll note our new name, the Safety & Sustainability Committee, with effect from 1 September 2021.\n\nTo ensure we are well positioned to advise the Board on these wider strategic considerations, given the rapidly changing external environment\n\nand growing societal expectations, the Committee welcomed new members. We/uni00A0thus have a/uni00A0refreshed composition, providing significant experience across engineering, safety, and process-focused industries as well as in-depth knowledge of the energy transition, climate change and stewardship of environmental and sustainability matters.\n\nDespite the widening of our remit, we have not lost/uni00A0sight of the health considerations we have customarily monitored. We saw continuing COVID-19 impacts being felt in both the UK and US through most of the year. Towards the end of the fiscal year, we monitored the gradual and safe return to the workplace for those who have been working from home. It is appropriate to/uni00A0recognise everyone's perseverance and forbearance throughout the last two years. In/uni00A0particular, the/uni00A0contributions of our front-line workers, who/uni00A0continued to work in the field through the pandemic, were exemplary. They have done a/uni00A0marvellous job designing, implementing and complying with numerous protocols to keep themselves healthy and thus protecting our customers as well. Our numbers of sickness within the workforce were low and productivity was maintained throughout. Nevertheless, the prolonged pandemic took an emotional toll on the entire organisation and the Committee has been briefed on the strengthening of the support the Company offers through various employee assistance programmes.\n\n## Safety, wellbeing and asset/uni00A0protection\n\nSafety is always our number one priority. We monitored both process and personal safety at every meeting and requested 'deep dives' into selected events where we felt our independent oversight would be of value. Whilst we have continued strong progress on our leading safety indicators, our lagging (LTIFR) safety performance has been challenging to sustain through the pandemic. This is a key area of focus and one that we will continue to track as a Committee. The integration of WPD also progressed throughout the year and we familiarised ourselves with WPD's measurement programme and how it would be aligned with National Grid's. In January 2022, Phil Swift, President of WPD, provided us with an overview of the safety management of WPD, including lessons learnt that were being shared between National Grid and WPD. Overall, we are mindful of the amount of organisational change ongoing. Given this backdrop, we have reviewed safety performance and progress; we will continue to challenge the organisation to keep its strong safety focus. You can see some of our key safety results at page 27.\n\nIn September 2021, there was a fire at one of our/uni00A0interconnectors at Sellindge, where we own and operate HVDC facilities across the English Channel. We are grateful that no one was injured in this incident, in part due to the excellent training and quick thinking of our operators on duty at the time. The damage to the facility and the potential risk to human life were thoroughly reviewed by the Committee; we convened an additional meeting in December 2021 to receive a report from the Group Chief Engineer on the status of the investigation and a further update was/uni00A0provided\n\nin/uni00A0January 2022 following the completion of the investigation. Lessons learnt have already been communicated throughout the organisation and/uni00A0will influence our practices going forward.\n\nThroughout the year, several significant storms in/uni00A0the UK and the US highlighted that we have to/uni00A0redouble our preparedness. The storms saw large swathes of customers disconnected from power for, in some cases, significant periods of/uni00A0time. Our people worked tirelessly to restore service to every last disconnection safely and securely. The emergence of extreme weather has potential impacts on our assets and our workforce. We will continue to provide oversight of the Company's efforts to adapt to extreme weather and to ensure our safety processes are robust and resilient to withstand whatever may come our way.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe second priority of this Committee is sustainability. In line with the Committee's expanded remit, we considered the Company's TCFD strategy through the year and are pleased to report that the Company has fully aligned its disclosures with the TCFD Recommended Disclosures. See pages 70 - 83 for further information. Whilst the Audit & Risk Committee focuses on the financial aspect of TCFD, we spent time considering the climate scenario analysis and the/uni00A0Company's wider climate strategy and commitments. We also received, for the first time this year, the Company's Climate Transition Plan for review. At/uni00A0the 2021 AGM, shareholders approved our first ever climate resolution, outlining our targets for net zero and our commitment to bring the Company's climate transition plan to a vote at the 2022 AGM. This/uni00A0plan will provide the opportunity to review our metrics and data in/uni00A0this area.\n\nWe also continued to review the Company's wider sustainability strategy and performance. National Grid's Responsible Business Report/uni00A0provides additional insights into our organisational aims and ambitions, and our performance against our net zero targets and wider sustainability strategy. We convened an/uni00A0ad-hoc Committee meeting in March 2022 to/uni00A0specifically consider our external reporting obligations in relation to sustainability and reviewed and commented on the initial drafts of these. We also brought the entire Board together for a separate session to undertake a/uni00A0thorough review of the aims, ambitions and measures to ensure that these commitments are embedded in the Board's stewardship.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAs we navigate these changing and challenging times, we will continue to ensure we are having the right discussions and challenging the progress and pace at which we are moving. It is sure to be another busy year and I look forward to providing you with a further update on our progress.\n\nEarl Shipp Committee Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mark Williamson stepped down from the Board effective 31 December 2021.\n- 2.   Liz Hewitt joined the Committee and Jonathan Silver stepped down from the Committee effective 1 September 2021.\n\n## Review of the year\n\nThis year we met on four scheduled occasions to undertake our responsibility as a Committee of monitoring the financial risk of the Group, focusing on the key areas within our remit: Treasury, Tax, Pensions and Insurance.\n\nDespite continued challenges presented by the pandemic, we engaged directly with a number of/uni00A0the finance professionals in the Company. Jonathan Silver and I met with a cross-section of/uni00A0members in the Treasury, Tax, Pensions and Financial Planning teams in Massachusetts. As/uni00A0most organisations are now back in offices, we will continue to arrange separate engagement sessions.\n\n## Transactions\n\nIt has been vital to continue our focus on the Group's financing strategy, which is supporting the portfolio repositioning of the Group. We received regular updates during 2021/22 on the/uni00A0progress of the ongoing transactions. As a/uni00A0Committee we've been/uni00A0particularly interested to/uni00A0hear about the progress of WPD colleague integration into key departments such as Treasury, Tax, Pensions and Insurance; I'm pleased to report the integration continues to progress well.\n\nWe've monitored progress of the sale of a/uni00A0majority stake in UK Gas Transmission throughout the year, including a review of the engagement with credit rating agencies and of the UK Gas Transmission derivative book ahead of the launch of the sale process. We have also continued to monitor progress on the sale of NECO to PPL.\n\n## Financial risk appetite\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed the Group's financial risk appetite and took the opportunity to evaluate how financial risk was managed in line with the Board's refreshed risk appetite framework.\n\n## Treasury\n\nIt has been another busy year for the Company in terms of bond issuances. I'm delighted that National Grid continues to attract strong investor demand in the market at both holding and operating company levels. The issuances we've seen have typically had large orderbooks and tight spreads. We continue to contribute to the Group's Green Financing commitments and in August 2021 National Grid plc issued a dual tranche \u20ac1.5 billion bond across 7/uni00A0years and 12/uni00A0years; the 7-year tranche was issued in a/uni00A0green format.\n\nIn March 2022, we received a presentation from one of our core global banking partners that provided a macro market update and included key updates on the external view of National Grid's bond issuances and impacts of/uni00A0the conflict in Ukraine and retail energy crisis.\n\nThroughout the year, we monitored the actions of the credit rating agencies. As noted above, we still have significant transactional activity ongoing and hence closely monitor our gearing, which will be reduced as asset proceeds are used to restore ratings headroom.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe fire at one of our interconnectors at Sellindge pushed significant focus on insurance for the Committee and has had an impact on the Company's approach to renewals for 2022/23, whilst market conditions have continued to harden. The Head of Insurance has spent significant time with the Committee providing updates on the claims process whilst I've worked with my fellow Committee Chairs on implications of safety and/uni00A0accounting.\n\n## Tax\n\nFollowing President Biden's election, we've stayed abreast of the US congressional tax proposals and potential impacts on the Group. In November 2021, we invited KPMG to update us on the key expected outcomes but indeed, at/uni00A0the time of writing, congressional action is still a/uni00A0moving/uni00A0target.\n\nIn the UK, with the increase in the minimum statutory rate, we have reviewed the changes that arise in the current year deferred taxes and/uni00A0the exceptional charge to remeasure the opening deferred tax liabilities going forward.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn the UK, pension investments are managed by/uni00A0independent Trustees. However, it is the Committee's duty to ensure funding is adequate to meet obligations. As the funding positions of the various defined benefit schemes improve, it/uni00A0allows the Trustees to reduce investment risk to/uni00A0everyone's benefit. This year, we oversaw the transfer of WPD's pension arrangements to National Grid and Trustee appointments will be refreshed in 2022/23. During the year, we invited Mercer to provide external expertise to the Committee on the UK pension landscape. We also received detail on the Pension Schemes Act 2021 and the/uni00A0potential implications this had on the Group.\n\nIn the US, pension investments are overseen by/uni00A0an internal fiduciary committee comprising senior leaders with appropriate levels of financial experience. Over the course of the year, we have/uni00A0worked to ensure the transition of pension and/uni00A0other retiree benefits of our Rhode Island colleagues as they move across to PPL. There has also been further de-risking of our pension and retiree welfare investments in light of the improvement to funding positions in recent years.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nGiven the impact of geopolitical events on energy markets and inflation in the broad economy, we continue to monitor the Group's risk appetite. We regularly review stress tests and seek to bring our expertise from other sectors of the economy to foster a holistic view/uni00A0of financial markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se Esperdy Committee Chair",

Martha Wyrsch was appointed to the Committee and Earl Shipp and Jonathan Silver stepped down from the Committee effective 1 September 2021.\n- 3.    Mark Williamson stepped down from the Board effective/uni00A031 December 2021.\n\n## Dear shareholders,\n\nThis is my first letter since becoming Chair in/uni00A0January 2022. Firstly, I would like to thank my predecessor Jonathan Dawson for his strong stewardship of the Remuneration Committee over the last nine years and all his help in ensuring a smooth transition of the Chair.\n\nThis year has presented a full agenda for the Board and Remuneration Committee. An ambitious business plan to deliver against the/uni00A0backdrop of an increasingly dynamic and demanding external context presented several important considerations for remuneration, particularly in the context of the new Remuneration Policy.\n\nWith the COVID-19 crisis a persistent and dominant theme at the start of the year, the/uni00A0Company maintained its position of no/uni00A0employees furloughed, no compulsory redundancies, and no pay/uni00A0reductions.\n\nIn November 2021, the world turned its attention to/uni00A0COP26 and the necessity and urgency of a/uni00A0net zero future for all intensified - further underscoring the importance of the Company's Climate Transition Plan and net zero strategy, a/uni00A0key area we focused on in our Directors' Remuneration Policy review this year.\n\nIn the final months of the financial year, the effects of higher gas prices, exacerbated by the tragic world events in Ukraine, presented serious affordability challenges for both consumers and businesses. The recent announcement of the early return of \u00a3200 million of interconnector revenue to UK consumers over/uni00A0the next two years and a plan to deliver \u00a3400 million of sustainable cost efficiencies per annum by 2024, with \u00a3140 million delivered to-date, demonstrate the Company's commitment to doing its part to support and enable a more affordable energy future for/uni00A0consumers.\n\nDespite these challenges, the Company delivered strong operational performance this year, reflecting substantial investment and a/uni00A0focus on delivering a clean, fair, and affordable energy/uni00A0future.\n\nIn March 2021, the Company announced the acquisition of WPD, the UK's largest electricity distribution business, and the sale of our US Rhode Island business. In/uni00A0March 2022, the Company announced the sale of a 60% equity stake in the UK Gas Transmission business. These/uni00A0transactions are a/uni00A0significant evolution of/uni00A0the Group's strategy and a major pivot towards electricity. The impact of the portfolio changes on financial results and performance outturns for/uni00A0the year are shown in greater detail in the/uni00A0implementation section of our remuneration/uni00A0report.\n\nThis year also presented the opportunity to review our Directors' Remuneration Policy (last/uni00A0approved in 2019) and examine how it might evolve. As we undertook this review, we sought to ensure that the best interests of all of/uni00A0our stakeholders today and over the next few years are properly addressed.\n\nTo do this, we set out to/uni00A0answer several key/uni00A0questions:\n\n- \u00b7  What are the right performance measures that/uni00A0clearly link the Company's performance and long-term strategy to value creation?\n- \u00b7  How can we better reflect the strategic importance of the Company's net zero strategy in remuneration?\n- \u00b7  How can we create flexibility/uni00A0given the increasingly dynamic external/uni00A0context?\n\nOver the last several months, the Committee and I have valued the engagement and collaboration of many of our major shareholders. The key elements of our new Remuneration Policy are summarised on page 113 and details are available on pages 124 - 128. Our Remuneration Policy proposal will be subject to/uni00A0a binding vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\nOur Directors' Remuneration 2021/22 report is/uni00A0structured to cover three key areas:\n\n- 1)  Remuneration at a glance\n- 2)  2021/22 implementation report\n- 3)   2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy and implementation\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes during the year\n\n## Salary, pension and benefits\n\nOur review of Executive Directors' salaries this/uni00A0year considered external market factors alongside wider workforce pay increases. The Committee has awarded salary increases of/uni00A03.75% to John Pettigrew and 6.5% to Andy Agg, both effective 1 July 2022. These changes are compared to an average increase of 4% across the UK wider workforce.\n\nOur previous Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) disclosed a three year plan to bring Andy Agg's base salary to a level broadly equal to the market median for his role. Andy's increase this year is the last installment to align his base pay.\n\nAs set out in our DRR last year, we acknowledged expectations from our shareholders to align Executive Directors' pension contribution rates with the majority of/uni00A0the UK wider workforce and have set out an approach to progressively do so. To that end, the pension allowances of John Pettigrew and Andy Agg were reduced to 12% of salary as of 1 April 2022, in line with pension contribution levels in the UK wider workforce, representing a material reduction in/uni00A0their fixed remuneration levels.\n\n## Annual Performance Plan (APP)\n\nThe APP for 2021/22 was based on financial performance measures (60%), operational measures (20%) and individual objectives (20%) that reflect key business and operational performance goals.",

        "page_content": "## Financial performance (60%)\n\nThe Company has again had a successful year, delivering strong financial results while investing in the net zero energy transition. In parallel, we saw the solid execution of a complex set of portfolio transactions to integrate WPD, progress on the agreement to sell the US Rhode Island business, and the sale of a majority stake in the UK Gas Transmission business.\n\nFormulaic outturns from the financial portion of the APP were 89.0% of the maximum based on achievement of 78.0% of maximum for Group Underlying EPS and 100% of maximum for Group RoE. APP outcomes are determined by/uni00A0financial results, with technical adjustments to/uni00A0targets including currency adjustments, unbudgeted pension costs and scrip dividend dilution, all in line with past practice.\n\n## Operational performance (20%)\n\nThe Committee allocated 10% of the operational portion of the 2021/22 APP to ensure strong execution of the portfolio transactions and a/uni00A0focus on value delivery for shareholders. Over the year, we announced the sale of a 60% equity stake in the UK Gas Transmission business, effectively managed regulatory and legal processes, and demonstrated solid progress on/uni00A0the initial integration of WPD into the Group. In this context, the Committee has set the performance outturn for the transactions at 10/uni00A0out of 12 which is 83.33% of the maximum.\n\nESG measures make up the remaining 10%\n\nof/uni00A0the operational portion of the 2021/22 APP. These measures reflect quantifiable environmental emissions and diversity targets aligned to key commitments set out in our RBC. The outturn for the ESG portion of the APP was/uni00A06 out of 8 which equates to 75% of the maximum, reflecting solid delivery of SF6, CO2 and methane emission reductions, and/uni00A0progress on DEI goals.\n\n## Individual objectives (20%)\n\nPerformance against individual objectives resulted in outturns of 80% and 85% of the/uni00A0maximum for John Pettigrew and Andy/uni00A0Agg/uni00A0respectively.\n\nTaking all the elements of performance together, the overall APP awards to the Executive Directors on the Board on 31 March 2022 were 85.2% of the maximum for John Pettigrew and 86.2% of the maximum for Andy Agg.\n\nThe details of the 2021/22 APP are further outlined on pages 114 - 116.\n\nIn reaching its overall decisions on the APP, the Committee considered the strong performance and delivery throughout the year across financial, operational, and individual objectives and determined no discretion was required to the APP formulaic outcome.\n\n## Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP)\n\nThe measurement period of the 2019 LTPP ended on 31 March 2022 and consisted of two measures - Group Value Growth and Group RoE. As discussed in last year's report, the weighting of performance measures for the 2019/uni00A0LTPP is one third Group RoE and two thirds Group Value Growth.\n\nThe formulaic vesting outcome of the 2019 LTPP/uni00A0was 74.22% of the maximum. The Committee reviewed whether there were any factors which might cause it to reduce the/uni00A0vesting levels and concluded after careful consideration that the vesting levels fairly reflected business performance and shareholder experience over the performance period.\n\nAs communicated in our DRR last year, we took the decision, given the timing and complexity of/uni00A0the portfolio transactions, to disclose the performance targets for the 2021 LTPP in this year's report. Note the 2021 LTPP award reverts to equal weighting of Group RoE and Group Value Growth performance measures. More details are set out on page 117.\n\n## Single figure and shareholding\n\nThe 2021/22 total remuneration single figures for/uni00A0John Pettigrew and Andy Agg are \u00a36.5 million and \u00a33.5 million respectively. These outcomes reflect strong, consistent short-term annual performance delivery in 2021/22 and longer-term value creation. The 2019 LTPP outcome makes up nearly \u00a34 million of the overall single figure for John Pettigrew and nearly \u00a32 million for Andy Agg. The value of the 2019 LTPP award is driven by the material share price growth of over 30% over the three-year performance period which in addition to dividends resulted in a total shareholder return (TSR) of 52%. These outcomes also reflect the heavy weighting/uni00A0on long-term share-based pay in our reward/uni00A0structure.\n\nIn last year's DRR, we set out an intent to review our post-employment shareholding requirement. As part of our Policy review, the Committee has/uni00A0concluded no changes are required. This/uni00A0decision considers an in-employment shareholding requirement (CEO: 500% of salary and other Executive Directors: 400% of salary) which is at the top end of market practice, and a/uni00A0post-employment shareholding requirement (200% of salary), which is in line with market practice. The Committee felt strongly it would be/uni00A0in the interest of shareholders to preserve the Executive Directors' shareholding requirements levels to ensure strong alignment with the shareholder experience.\n\n## Our 2022 Policy renewal\n\nDuring the year, the Committee conducted a/uni00A0review of the Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy, considering:\n\n- 1)   alignment to our business strategy and wider stakeholders (incentive measures and target-setting);\n- 2)   alignment to our talent strategy (quantum and market practice); and\n- 3)   corporate governance requirements.\n\nHaving discussed these proposals with a/uni00A0number of our shareholders and governance bodies, the Committee proposes to/uni00A0make the following key changes to the Remuneration Policy, subject to their approval by/uni00A0shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Financial and operational performance measures:\n\n- \u00b7  Retain Group RoE in both the APP and LTPP to ensure the efficiency of annual operational delivery and the quality and sustainability of long-term shareholder value/uni00A0creation.\n- \u00b7  Replace Group Value Growth in our LTPP with a three-year cumulative Underlying EPS measure. We believe a more recognised and commonly used measure will simplify remuneration and enhance transparency for/uni00A0both shareholders and employees, and create strong alignment to the Company's investor proposition.\n- \u00b7  Retain an in-year earnings measure - i.e. Underlying EPS in our APP to ensure we continue to incentivise and reward strong operational delivery.\n\nWhilst we recognise our short-term (APP) and long-term (LTPP) financial measures are similar, we believe these are the right measures to support delivery of the business strategy and the/uni00A0resultant creation of shareholder value.\n\nThe combination of annual and long-term earnings and returns measures act together to/uni00A0incentivise strong operational delivery in-year, together with long-term sustainable growth. As/uni00A0such, financial measures have been designed to incentivise different elements of performance in the short-term (APP) and the long-term (LTPP). See pages 129 - 130 for a further overview of our financial performance measures for 2022/23.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance\n\nOur 2022 Policy expands the focus of ESG and incorporates further measures aligned to targets set out in our RBC.\n\n- \u00b7  Broaden and simplify ESG measures in the APP to reflect key elements of our responsible business strategy - customers, colleagues and DEI.\n- \u00b7  Introduce net zero transition measures aligned/uni00A0to:\n- i)  quantitative reductions in our Scope 1 emissions; and\n- ii) the enablement of the net zero transition.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration report continued\n\nFinally, we recognise the value of some flexibility in the Policy to better adapt to business and market changes. As such, our new Policy provides greater flexibility to:\n\n- \u00b7  enable the Committee to set appropriate financial, strategic, and ESG measures and/uni00A0weightings in respect of each APP/ LTPP/uni00A0award; and\n- \u00b7  provide for the possibility of a one-year additional maximum incentive level of up to/uni00A050%, to be used only in exceptional circumstances (e.g. recruitment).\n\nNo material changes would be made to performance measures without prior consultation with major shareholders.\n\n## Other matters\n\nWhen taking remuneration decisions in relation to Executive Directors, the Committee takes into consideration remuneration data across the industry (through market benchmarking) and our wider workforce (e.g. CEO pay ratio, gender and ethnic pay gap data, and colleagues' views on executive pay) to ensure decisions are fair, equitable, and aligned to performance in line with the Company's values.\n\nFair and equitable reward is at the heart of National Grid's values. Within the UK, National Grid continues to be an accredited real living wage employer by the Living Wage Foundation. Our UK mean gender base pay gap of -1.6% (median of 2.4%) has shown a strong trend since 2018 in closing the pay gap between genders working in comparable roles. Across the/uni00A0US, our mean gender base pay gap continues to/uni00A0improve from 13.5% in 2021 to 12.6% this year. Additional gender and ethnic pay gap data is reported in our Responsible Business Report (RBR).\n\n## Payment to past Directors\n\nNicola Shaw stood down from the Board on 26 July 2021 and stayed with the Company until/uni00A0after the conclusion of the RIIO-T2 CMA appeal process and continued as Chair of the Company's subsidiaries, National Grid Electricity Transmission plc and National Grid Gas plc. She/uni00A0was deemed to be a good leaver given her/uni00A0overall long-term strong performance and contribution to the business. She remained in active employment until 31 October 2021, after which she was not eligible for 2021/22 APP and/uni00A0received salary and benefits until her final employment date of 30 April 2022, as per the terms of her contract. Her APP was pro-rated for/uni00A0her period of active employment for/uni00A02021/22. Her 2019 LTPP will vest at the normal vesting date in July 2022, subject to performance conditions and is pro-rated for time served to/uni00A0the/uni00A0final employment date of 30 April 2022, in/uni00A0accordance with the plan rules.\n\nDetails of Nicola Shaw's remuneration in relation to the period 1 April 2021 to 26 July 2021 (qualifying service as an Executive Director) and 27 July 2021 to 31 March 2022, are presented in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table on page 114. All payments are in accordance with her service agreement, the Directors' Remuneration Policy and in line with our June 2021 Corporate Governance disclosure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank shareholders for their input and engagement this year. We continue to aim to maintain an open dialogue on remuneration matters and welcome your further comments and feedback. We respectfully ask for your support at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLord Ian Livingston Committee Chair",

These outcomes reflect strong annual performance delivery in 2021/22 and longer-term value creation as evidenced in the 2019 LTPP outcome. The single total figures of remuneration are in large driven by the heavy weighting on long-term share awards which make up to two-thirds of total remuneration, and nearly 80% of variable pay. The 2019 LTPP performance is driven in part by the impact of share price growth of 31.6%, yielding a Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 52% over the three-year performance period in addition to long-term business performance delivery.\n\nThe 2021/22 total single figures represent an achievement of 79.4% for John Pettigrew and 75.7% for Andy Agg of the total maximum opportunity for/uni00A02021/22. This is line with last year's outcomes which were 81.8% for John Pettigrew and 83.9% for Andy Agg of the total maximum opportunity for/uni00A02020/21.\n\n## Alignment of remuneration with our business strategy\n\nWe align our performance linked elements of remuneration (APP and LTPP) through our strategic priorities, our RBC commitments, and our vision of a/uni00A0clean, fair and affordable energy future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Our vision and values                                                                   | Our strategic priorities               | Our RBC commitments                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Our vision is to be at the heart  of a clean, fair and affordable  energy future.       | Enable the energy   transition for all | The  environment Our  people Our  communities |\n| Every day we do the right  thing, find a/uni00A0better way, and  make it/uni00A0happen. | Deliver  for    customers efficiently  | The  economy Our  governance                  |\n\n## Key principles of our remuneration strategy\n\n- \u00b7  Reward delivery of the Group's strategy in a matter that is simple, transparent, and aligned to shareholders' interests\n- \u00b7  Attract, motivate, and retain senior executives with market-competitive reward\n- \u00b7  Align performance measures to the way National Grid earns its returns for shareholders, with targets set to incentivise stretching financial and operational performance in line with shareholder expectations\n- \u00b7  Reflect and underpin the Company's vision, values, and contribution to society\n\n## How we achieve this in practice\n\n- \u00b7  Alignment of APP and LTPP performance measures to core financial and non-financial KPIs\n- \u00b7  Heavy weighting towards share-based long-term pay to reflect the nature and duration of National Grid's businesses and asset lives\n- \u00b7  A mandatory two-year holding period for APP share awards and vested LTPP awards\n\n\u00b7  A very high minimum shareholding requirement for senior executives (500% for the CEO - equivalent to nine times the after-tax salary)\n\n- \u00b7  A post-employment shareholding required for all senior executives\n\n## Our 2022 Remuneration Policies are aligned to our business strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnable the energy transition for all\n\nDeliver for customers efficiently\n\nGrow our organisational capability\n\nEmpower colleagues for great performance\n\nAddition of net zero measures in/uni00A0LTPP aligned to commitment set/uni00A0our in our RBC\n\nFinancial measures strongly aligned to incentivise operational excellence and long-term value creation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreased flexibility to better adapt measures to align to critical priorities that underpin short/ longer-term/uni00A0performance\n\nEmphasis on Company culture and/uni00A0DEI in APP",

Details on her financial, operational and individual objective assessment can be found on page 115 - 116.\n\nLTPP : The 2019 LTPP is due to vest in July 2022. The average share price over the three months from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 of 1,098.09 pence has been applied and estimated dividend equivalents are included. The 2020/21 LTPP figures have been restated to reflect the actual share price on vesting and all dividend equivalent shares. As the vesting share price of 930.43 pence was higher versus the estimate of 855.04 pence (and the additional dividend equivalent shares added for the dividend with a record date of 4 June 2021 with a dividend rate of 32.16 pence per share), the actual value at vesting was circa \u00a3296,000, \u00a382,000 and \u00a3138,000 higher than for the estimate published last year for John Pettigrew, Andy Agg and Nicola Shaw, respectively. Nicola Shaw's 2019 LTPP will vest at the normal vesting dates 1 July 2022 subject to performance conditions and is pro-rated for time served to the date of 30 April 2022 in accordance with plan rules.\n\nImpact of share price change: The 2019 LTPP awards were granted on 28 June 2019 with a share price of 834.11 pence. The impact of share price change for the 2019 LTPP, comparing share price at grant versus the average share price for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 of 1,098.09 pence, is an increase of 263.98 pence (31.6%) per share compared with an increase of 2.1% for the 2018 LTPP performance period (excluding dividends).\n\n## Total pension benefits\n\nAndy Agg, John Pettigrew and Nicola Shaw received a cash allowance in lieu of participation in a pension arrangement. There are no additional benefits on early retirement. The values of these benefits received during this year, are shown in the single total figure of remuneration table.\n\nJohn Pettigrew has also accrued defined benefit (DB) entitlements; he opted out of the DB scheme on 31 March 2016 with a deferred pension and lump sum payable at his normal retirement date of 26 October 2031. At 31 March 2022, John Pettigrew's accrued DB pension was reduced to \u00a385,409 per annum and his accrued lump sum was \u00a3256,225. These figures reflect a permanent change in John Pettigrew's pension entitlements going forward. No additional DB entitlements have been earned over the financial year, other than an increase for price inflation due under the pension scheme rules and legislation. Under the terms of the pension scheme, if John Pettigrew qualifies for ill-health requirements, or is made redundant, a pension may be payable earlier than his normal retirement date. A lump sum death in service benefit is also provided in respect of these DB/uni00A0entitlements.\n\n## 2021/22 Annual Performance Plan\n\nAPP awards reward delivery against annual financial, operational and strategic performance targets and goals. For 2021/22, financial measures represent 60% of the award, operational measures 20%, and individual objectives the remaining 20% of the maximum. Payment of the APP award is made in shares (50% of the award) and cash (50% of the award). Shares (after any sales to pay associated tax) must be retained until the shareholding requirement is met, and in any event for a minimum of two years after receipt.\n\nFor financial measures, threshold, target and stretch performance levels are set by the Committee for the performance period and pay out at 0%, 50% and 100% of the maximum calculated on a straight-line basis. Operational measures have been assessed on a four-point scale (not met, partially achieved, achieved and over-achieved) based on quantitative targets set at the beginning of the year by the Committee. Target and stretch performance levels for the individual objectives are also predetermined by the Committee for the performance period, and an assessment of the performance relative to the target and stretch performance levels is made at the end of the performance year on each objective. Executive Directors have a maximum opportunity of 125% of base salary.",

Investment in critical infrastructure remained strong, with capital investment (continuing) of \u00a36.7 billion driving asset growth of 8.7%. The businesses delivered solid earnings and returns, in particular in our UK Electricity and Gas Transmission and Metering businesses. The financial performance outcomes of the 2021/22 APP awards are summarised in the tables below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Measure                 | Weighting  (% of APP)   | Threshold  Target   | Stretch   | Outcome  (% of max)                          |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 30%                     | 72.0                    | 75.0                | 78.0      | Group Underlying EPS (pence per share) 78.0% |\n| Group RoE (%)           | 30%                     | 76.7 10.2% 11.4%    | 10.6%     | 9.8% 100.0%                                  |\n| Total financial outturn |                         |                     |           | 89.0%                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Denotes an 'alternative performance measure' as described on pages 268 - 279\n\nNotes : Underlying EPS: Technical adjustments have been made to increase the performance range (each of the threshold, target and stretch) by 1.6 pence to reflect the net effect of/uni00A0currency adjustments, US pension assumptions, and scrip issuance. Financial targets were set to include the impacts of the portfolio transactions, specifically the addition of/uni00A0WPD to the Group. Group underlying EPS of 76.7 pence includes 11.4 pence from UK Gas Transmission discontinued operations, and excludes timing and major storm costs as outlined on page 271 in the Financial Results.\n\nNicola Shaw: The total financial outturn for Nicola was 96.3% of maximum based on performance against equally weighted measures (20% each) of UK RoE (outcome of 100% of max), UK underlying operating profit (outcome of 100% of max) and UK regulated controllable costs (outcome of 88.9% of max). Technical adjustments were applied to UK/uni00A0operating profit for the impact of CPI on revenues. The UK outturn is based on an equal weighting of the UK Electricity Transmission and UK Gas Transmission and/uni00A0Metering businesses.\n\n## APP - Operational performance\n\nThe operational measures (20%) of the 2021/22 APP were weighted equally between two key objectives - 1) effective completion of the Group portfolio transactions (10%); and 2) quantifiable ESG measures to reduce factors relating to Scope 1 direct carbon emissions and improve employee diversity.\n\nOperational measures were assessed on a four-point scale (not met, partially achieved, achieved and over-achieved) based on quantifiable targets where possible and qualitative outcomes to reflect a balanced assessment of performance. All ESG measures were evaluated against quantifiable targets which are aligned to our RBC commitments.\n\n| Measure                                    | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Assessment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Outcome                      |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Transactions  (10%)                        | Effective management to the satisfaction of  the/uni00A0Board:  \u00b7  WPD transaction \u00b7  Sale and separation of UK GT  \u00b7  Separation of RI                                                                                                                          | WPD: New operating model design, embedded culture and values, maintained  business continuity and performance.

Performance is assessed at the end of the financial year by the Board and Remuneration Committee. The CEO completed a self-evaluation which was shared with members of the Board for their comments. The Chair compiled these comments, and based on these comments, proposed a scoring for each of the goals. The CEO undertook the same process for the other Executive Directors and presented his recommendations to the Committee in May 2022. The table below sets out the 2021/22 individual objectives together with associated performance commentaries and the Committee's assessment of the performance outcome for each of the Executive Directors:\n\n## Individual objectives and performance summary - John Pettigrew\n\nOutcome\n\n## Execute on the announced portfolio repositioning and deliver results on organisational streamlining\n\n- \u00b7  Successful execution of the strategic pivot to electricity; purchase of WPD\n- \u00b7  Effective management of divestitures and transition of WPD into the Group whilst ensuring solid business performance/continuity\n- \u00b7  Progression and development of the Company's long-term strategic blueprint\n\n## Demonstrate substantial progress in modernising how the Group works, enhancing a culture of accountability\n\n- \u00b7  Demonstrated progress in shifting the Group's culture, with a strong focus on DEI and positive employee satisfaction results\n- \u00b7  Made progress to improve bench strength of senior leadership group and Group Executive team\n\n## Raise the level of engagement with the public, communities and government\n\n\u00b7  COP26 and Capital Markets Day - repositioned National Grid across key stakeholder groups as a critical part of the energy transition\n\n- \u00b7  Strengthened governmental, public and community relations, and key relationships in particular at the local level\n\n## Individual objectives and performance summary - Andy Agg\n\nOutcome\n\n## Successfully execute the portfolio repositioning\n\n- \u00b7  Effectively managed financing strategy and credit ratings approach for the acquisition of WPD\n- \u00b7  Strong execution of portfolio repositioning; divestment of 60% stake in UK Gas Transmission, 50% stake in St William Homes LLP\n- \u00b7  Successfully ensured the mitigation of all stranded costs resulting from the portfolio transactions\n\n## Demonstrate progress in the Group-wide and Finance transformation programmes\n\n- \u00b7  Strong leadership across the Group driving in-year delivery and progression of \u00a3400 million of cost efficiencies per annum by the end of 2023/24\n- \u00b7  Delivered solid progress against key transformation milestones, advanced key process and technology enabled efficiencies\n- \u00b7  Improved talent, succession potential, and capabilities within the CFO function\n\n## Deliver enhanced investor engagement programme\n\n- \u00b7  Successfully engaged investors on the five-year investor framework and strategic pivot to electricity with positive feedback/sentiment\n- \u00b7  Increased transparency of our responsible business strategy yielding positive engagement and external ESG company ratings\n\n## Individual objectives and performance summary - Nicola Shaw\n\nOutcome\n\n## Successfully execute on UK businesses priorities\n\n- \u00b7  Effectively managed UK businesses to deliver on track mid-year financial performance for first year of RIIO-T2\n- \u00b7  Successfully implemented operating model to stand up separate Electricity and Gas Transmission UK businesses\n\n## Deliver a successful Competition & Markets Authority outcome\n\n- \u00b7  Led process to submit all RIIO-T1 reopeners with Ofgem\n- \u00b7  Managed and executed the CMA process effectively; with a positive result on the out-performance wedge\n\n## Grow National Grid's positioning on the UK's net zero future\n\n- \u00b7  Established East Coast asset investment strategy to facilitate connection of 40+ GW of offshore renewables by 2030\n- \u00b7  Fostered strong relationships with key stakeholders to lay the groundwork for the development of net zero investment roadmap\n\n## 2019 Long-Term Performance Plan award\n\nThe 2019 LTPP that will vest on 1 July 2022 was structured as outlined below in consideration of the transition to RIIO-T2 in the UK during the performance period. The financial measures and weightings of the 2019 LTPP below are the same for all Executive Directors.\n\n- \u00b7  Group RoE over a two-year period (2019/20 - 2020/21) determines one third of the award\n- \u00b7  Group Value Growth over the three-year period (2019/20 - 2021/22) determines two thirds of the award\n\nThe outturns of the 2019 LTPP reflect solid business performance over the three-year period, and are summarised below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Performance measure     | Weighting   | Threshold   20% vesting   | Maximum   100% vesting   | Actual   % of maximum   |\n|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Group RoE 33.33%        |             | 11.0% 11.1%               | 12.5%                    | 22.67%                  |\n| Group Value Growth      | 66.67%      | 10.0% 12.7%               | 12.0%                    | 100.00%                 |\n| Overall vesting outcome |             |                           |                          | 74.22%                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs disclosed in last year's DRR, the Group Value Growth measure in 2019 includes an upward adjustment versus the reported measure to reflect the value added from the sale of the residual interest in the UK Gas Distribution business and to adjust for the revised timing of UK cash tax payments. The Committee decided not to reflect upward adjustments to Group RoE or Group Value Growth for prior years (+0.3% in 2019/20 and +0.2% in 2020/21) resulting from the revisions described in note 1F to the consolidated financial statements in 2020/21 into the 2019 LTPP.\n\n65%\n\n85%\n\n80%\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2019 LTPP Vesting\n\nThe 2019 LTTP vesting reflects both the final performance outturn and the impact share price and dividends from the time of issue to vesting date. For the 2019 award, the share price appreciation represents a material proportion of the total vesting value. The 2019 LTPP awards were granted on 28 June 2019 with a share price of 834.11 pence. Comparing the share price at grant versus the average share price for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 of 1,098.09 pence, yields a share price gain for the 2019 LTPP of 263.9 pence (31.6%) per share in addition to estimated dividend yield of 148.7/uni00A0pence per share.\n\nThe amounts due to vest under the 2019 LTPP for the performance period that ended on 31 March 2022 which are included in the 2021/22 single total figure table on page 114, are shown in the table below. The current share price valuation is an estimate based on the average share price over the three months from 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 of 1,098.09 pence and the proposed dividend with record date of 6 June 2022, subject to shareholder approval, is included. The total value of awards vesting and dividend equivalent shares are subject to a two-year holding period.\n\n|                | Shares  awarded   |   Performance  outcome  (% of maximum) | Vested shares  based on  performance   | Face value of the  award at grant (\u00a3'000s)   |   Share price  appreciation (\u00a3'000s) |   Dividend  equivalent shares  (\u00a3'000s) | Total  value (\u00a3'000s)   |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| John Pettigrew | 431,969           |                                  74.22 | 320,607                                | 2,674                                        |                                  846 |                                     477 | 3,997                   |\n| Andy Agg       | 213,999           |                                  74.22 | 158,830                                | 1,325                                        |                                  419 |                                     236 | 1,980                   |\n| Nicola Shaw\u00b9   | 190,739           |                                  74.22 | 141,566                                | 1,181                                        |                                  374 |                                     211 | 1,765                   |\n\n## Assessment of National Grid shareholder returns\n\nThe figure below outlines National Grid plc's 10-year annual TSR performance against the FTSE 100 Index since 31 March 2012 and illustrates the growth in value of a notional \u00a3100 holding invested in National Grid on 31 March 2012, compared with the same invested in the FTSE 100 Index. The FTSE 100 Index has been chosen because it is a widely recognised performance benchmark for large companies in the UK and it is a useful reference to assess relative value creation for National Grid shareholders. Over the last 10-year period, National Grid's relative TSR is 194% versus the FTSE 100 at 82% demonstrating sustainable long-term value for our shareholders. Over the more recent three-year performance period for the 2019 LTPP, National Grid's relative TSR was 52% versus the FTSE 100 relative TSR of 13%, which underscores the strong alignment of our Remuneration Policy with the value delivered for our shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nData source: Datastream by Refinitiv\n\nNotes: The TSR level shown at 31 March each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for the 30-day period up to and including that date. It assumes dividends are/uni00A0reinvested.\n\n## 2021 Long-Term Performance Plan\n\n## 2021 LTPP performance conditions\n\nAs disclosed in last year's DRR, we reverted to equal weighting for Group RoE and Group Value Growth, measured over the entire three-year performance period, for the 2021 LTPP. Below are the performance ranges for the two measures in the 2021 LTPP. As noted, setting of targets was delayed to enable proper consideration of the portfolio transactions for WPD, UK Gas Transmission, and the US Rhode Island businesses.\n\n| Performance measures   | Weighting   | Threshold  20% vesting   | Maximum  100% vesting   |\n|------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Group RoE              | 50%         | 9.75%                    | 11.00%                  |\n| Group Value Growth     | 50%         | 9.25%                    | 11.00%                  |\n\nNotes : Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight-line basis. The calculation for the Group RoE measure will reflect the updated methodology from 2021/22 going forward as outlined on page 277 of the Annual Report.",

The following table shows the position of each of the Executive Directors in relation with the shareholding requirement and the number of shares owned by the Non-executive Directors, including connected persons. The/uni00A0shareholding is as of 31 March 2022 and the salary used to calculate the value of the shareholding is the gross annual salary as/uni00A0of 31 March 2022.\n\nJohn Pettigrew continues to meet his shareholding requirement. Andy Agg, who was appointed the CFO in 2019, has not yet met his shareholding requirement and is expected to do so in 2023. The projections assume on-target performance/vesting outcomes. They will not be allowed to sell shares,/uni00A0except for covering associated tax liabilities, until their individual shareholding requirements are met. Non-executive Directors do not have a/uni00A0shareholding requirement.\n\nFurther shares have been purchased in each of April and May 2022 on behalf of each of John Pettigrew and Andy Agg via the Share Incentive Plan (an/uni00A0HMRC tax-advantaged all-employee share plan), thereby increasing the beneficial interests by 25 shares (12 in April and 13 in May) for John Pettigrew and 24/uni00A0shares (12 each in April and May) for Andy Agg. There have been no other changes in Directors' shareholdings between 1 April 2022 and 19 May 2022.\n\nThe expected vesting dates for the conditional share awards subject to performance conditions are 1 July 2022, 3 July 2023 and 1 July 2024 for the 2019 LTPP, 2020 LTPP and 2021 LTPP respectively.\n\n| Directors                    | Share ownership  requirements   (multiple of salary)   | Number of shares   owned outright (including  connected persons)   | Value of shares   held as a multiple   of current salary   | Number of options   granted under   the Sharesave Plan   | Conditional share awards  subject to performance  conditions (LTPP 2019,  2020, and 2021)   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Executive Directors          |                                                        |                                                                    |                                                            |                                                          |                                                                                             |\n| John Pettigrew               | 500%                                                   | 1,052,126                                                          | 1,097%                                                     | 4,219                                                    | 1,235,754                                                                                   |\n| Andy Agg                     | 400%                                                   | 216,807                                                            | 353%                                                       | 4,316                                                    | 646,787                                                                                     |\n| Non-executive Directors      |                                                        |                                                                    |                                                            |                                                          |                                                                                             |\n| Liz Hewitt                   | -

The Executive Directors have acknowledged that if they breach their post-employment shareholding requirement for any reason, the Company may enforce at its discretion one or more of the following processes: to request they repay to the Company an amount equivalent in value to the shareholding requirement that has not been met; the Company may withdraw/vary the vesting of any future shares granted under the LTPP; the Company may publish a public statement in a form, as the Company may decide that the Director has failed to comply with the post-employment shareholding requirement. Executive Directors are reminded annually, when employed, of the post-employment shareholding requirement. At termination, the minimum shareholding requirement is confirmed to the Director and checks are made by/uni00A0the Company at the 12-month and 24-month anniversary of leaving and at the financial year-end 31 March to ascertain if their post-employment shareholding requirement has been met.",

As of 31 March 2022, Nicola Shaw continues to meet her in-employment shareholding requirement.\n\n## Shareholder dilution\n\nThe Company has a number of multiple all-employee share plans that provide employees the opportunity to become shareholders. These plans include Sharesave and the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) in the UK and the 401(k) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan in the US.\n\nWhere shares may be issued or treasury shares reissued to satisfy incentives, the aggregate dilution resulting from executive share-based incentives will not exceed 5% in any 10-year period. Dilution resulting from all incentives, including all-employee incentives, will not exceed 10% in any 10-year period. The Committee reviews dilution levels against these limits annually and under these limits the Company, as at 31 March 2022, had a headroom of 3.9% and 7.8%/uni00A0respectively.\n\n## CEO pay ratio\n\nWe have disclosed our CEO pay ratios comparing the CEO single total figure of remuneration to the equivalent pay for the 25th quartile, median, and 75th quartile UK employees (calculated on a full-time equivalent basis), as well as the median Group-wide pay ratio.\n\n## CEO Pay Ratios 2021/22 to 2018/19\n\nUK\n\nGroup-wide\n\n| Year                | Method   | 25th percentile pay ratio   | Median pay ratio   | 75th percentile pay ratio   | Median pay ratio   |\n|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n| 2021/22             | Option A | 135:1                       | 105:1              | 81:1                        | 76:1               |\n| 2020/21             | Option A | 104:1                       | 81:1               | 62:1                        | 54:1               |\n| 2019/20             | Option A | 111:1                       | 86:1               | 66:1                        | 53:1               |\n| 2018/19 - voluntary | Option A | 96:1                        | 76:1               | 58:1                        | 48:1               |\n\nNotes: Following the completion of the WPD acquisition in June 2021, this year's CEO pay ratio includes circa 6,600 UK WPD employees in the data set. Salaries as at 31 March 2022 and estimated performance-based annual payments for 2021/22 have been annualised for part-time employees to reflect full-time equivalents. Performance payments have not been further adjusted to compensate where new employees have not completed a full performance year. The comparison with UK employees is specified by the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 (as amended). US employees represent approximately 56% of our total employees. Our median pay ratio on a Group-wide basis is 76:1, calculated on the same basis as the UK pay ratios and at an exchange rate of $1.348:\u00a31.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio has increased to 105:1 at the UK median. The increase is explained by the increase in the CEO's single total figure of remuneration primarily due to the impact of the 2019 LTPP performance driven in part by the impact of share price growth of 31.6% over the three-year performance period and strong long-term business performance delivery. For reference, the impact of share price change for the 2019 LTPP, comparing share price at grant versus the average share price for the period 1 January 2022 to 31 March 2022 of 1,098.09 pence, for each Executive Director is an increase of 263.98 pence (31.6%) per share excluding the dividend (versus an increase of 2.1% for the 2018 LTPP). This year the 2019 LTPP vesting represents circa 61% (last year 54%) of the CEO's single total figure of remuneration. Excluding estimated 2019 LTPP vesting, our UK median pay ratio is 40:1 (last year 39:1). On a Group basis, the median pay ratio has increased to 76:1. The lower Group median pay ratio reflects the higher level of wages in the regions of the US where we operate as compared with the UK. Nearly 56% of our employees are US-based. Excluding estimated 2019 LTPP vesting, the Groupwide median pay ratio is 29:1.\n\nThese results highlight a key feature of our remuneration strategy to weight Executive and senior leadership compensation more heavily towards longer-term performance share based reward. Across the wider workforce, employee compensation is largely focused on in-year annual delivery.\n\nThe 2021/22 base pay and total pay including benefits for the CEO versus UK workforce is shown below.\n\n## 2021/22 Base pay and benefits - CEO, UK wider workforce\n\n| Pay and benefits data   | CEO remuneration   | UK employee 25th percentile   | UK employee 50th percentile   | UK employee 75th percentile   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Base salary             | \u00a31,047,115         | \u00a336,598                       | \u00a342,054                       | \u00a355,726                       |\n| Total pay and benefits  | \u00a36,505,511         | \u00a348,038                       | \u00a361,834                       | \u00a380,297                       |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\nStatement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2021/22 continued\n\nFlexibility is provided to adopt one of three methods for calculating the ratios. We have chosen Option A, which is a calculation based on the pay of all UK/uni00A0employees on a full-time equivalent basis, as this option is considered to be more statistically robust. The ratios are based on total pay and benefits inclusive of short-term and long-term incentives applicable for the respective financial year 1 April - 31 March. The reference employees at the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile have been determined by reference to pay and taxable benefits as at the last day of the respective financial year, 31 March, with estimates for the respective APP payouts and performance outcomes of the LTPP and dividend equivalents.\n\nMost employees are eligible for a performance-based annual payment. Our principles for pay setting and progression in our wider workforce are the same as for our executives - mid-market approach to total reward sufficiently competitive to attract and retain high-calibre individuals without over-paying and providing the opportunity for individual development and career progression. The pay ratios reflect how remuneration arrangements differ, as/uni00A0accountability increases for more senior roles within the organisation, and in particular the ratios reflect the weighting towards long-term value creation and alignment with shareholder interests for the CEO.\n\nWe are satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with our wider pay, reward and progression policies for employees. The median reference employee falls within our collectively bargained employee population and has the opportunity for annual pay increases, annual performance payments and career progression and development opportunities. The CEO received a pay increase of 2.3% in 2021/22 in line with the increase budget awarded across the UK employee population (no increase was granted in 2020/21).\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe chart below shows the relative importance of spend on pay compared with other costs and disbursements (dividends, tax, net interest and capital expenditure). Given the capital-intensive nature of our business and the scale of our operations, these costs were chosen as the most relevant measures for comparison purposes. All amounts exclude exceptional items and remeasurements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.  The dividend figure for 2020/21 has been restated at \u00a31,742 million (from \u00a31,738 million) to reflect the actual value of dividends paid.\n- 2.   2020/21 payroll costs, tax, net interest and capital investment have been re-presented to reflect the classification of the UK Gas Transmission business as a/uni00A0discontinued/uni00A0operation.\n- 3.

She is not eligible for any benefits.\n\nOther emoluments: In accordance with the Company's expenses policies, Non-executive Directors receive reimbursement for their reasonable expenses for attending Board meetings. In instances where these costs are treated by HMRC as taxable benefits, the Company also meets the associated tax cost to the Non-executive Directors through a/uni00A0PAYE settlement agreement with HMRC and these costs are included in the table above. For 2020/21 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, most of the NEDs did not incur travel-related expenses.\n\nThe total emoluments paid to Executive and Non-executive Directors in the year was \u00a314.2 million (2020/21: \u00a311.7 million).\n\n## Percentage change in Remuneration (Executive Directors, Non-executive Directors, employee average)\n\nIn line with the revised Shareholder Rights Directive (2019), we have included percentage change in salary/fee, bonus and benefits for each of the Directors compared to prior years. The regulations cover employees of the Parent Company only and not across the Group, and since we have very few people employed by our Parent Company (National Grid plc), we have voluntarily chosen a comparator group of all employees in the UK and the US to provide a representative comparison. In line with the regulations, we shall build this information to display a five-year history.\n\n2020/21\n\n2021/22\n\n|                         | Benefits Bonus   | Benefits Bonus   | Benefits Bonus   | Benefits Bonus   | Benefits Bonus   | Benefits Bonus   |\n|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Executive Directors     | Salary           |                  |                  | Salary           |                  |                  |\n| John Pettigrew          | 1.3%             | -4.7%            | 15.4%            | 1.7%             | -8.8%            | 7.8%             |\n| Andy Agg                | 4.9%             | 40.6%            | 17.7%            | 6.5%             | -31.6%           | 15.9%            |\n| Nicola Shaw             | 1.3%             | 1.1%             | 38.8%            | 1.7%             | 18.3%            | -33.1%           |\n| Non Executive Directors |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |\n| Jonathan Dawson         | 0.5%             | 37.1%            | n/a              | -3.0%            | 417.6%           | n/a              |\n| Therese Esperdy         | 0.4%             | -100.0%          | n/a              | -0.8%            | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Sir Peter Gershon       | 0.5%             | -5.5%            | n/a              | -83.3%           | -85.0%           | n/a              |\n| Paul Golby              | 0.5%             | -87.5%           | n/a              | -68.5%           | 213.8%           | n/a              |\n| Liz Hewitt              | 334.8%           | -100.0%          | n/a              | 14.5%            | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Amanda Mesler           | 0.5%             | -100.0%          | n/a              | 1.6%             | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Paula Rosput Reynolds   | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | 2816.8%          | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Earl Shipp              | 0.5%             | -100.0%          | n/a              | 8.6%             | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Jonathan Silver         | 14.3%            | -100.0%          | n/a              | -4.2%            | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Mark Williamson         | -8.6%            | -100.0%          | n/a              | -29.2%           | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Ian Livingston          | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Tony Wood               | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Martha Wyrsch           | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Anne Robinson           | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              | n/a              |\n| Employee median         | -8.49%           | 1.65%            | -5.52%           | 2.8%             | 6.1%             | 40%              |\n\nNote: For Nicola Shaw, the 2021/22 data reflects the salary, benefits and bonus paid for the complete year as presented in the single total figure of remuneration table.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\nStatement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in 2021/22 continued\n\nFor 2021/22, the percentage change data for salary/fees reflects that, other than for Andy Agg, the salary/fee increases for Directors were 2.3% in line with the wider workforce increases. For 2020/21, the percentage change data for salary/fees reflects that, other than for Andy Agg, there were no salary/ fee increases for Directors. In contrast, the majority of managers and all those covered by trade union agreements were eligible to receive an annual salary increase during/uni00A02020/21. The average salary increase budget for the UK and the US employees, subject to performance review, was 2.3% and 2.5% respectively in 2020/21.\n\nBudgets vary for employees covered by collective agreements depending on arrangements agreed with the respective trade unions. The Committee takes account of the general salary increase budgets available for managers/non-unionised employees when reviewing Directors' salaries/fees.\n\nFurther alignment between Executive Director pay and arrangements available to the wider workforce is evidenced by the approach that all employees have the opportunity to receive a bonus which is linked to either a combination of individual and Company/business performance measures, or Company/ business performance measures only, thus enabling employees as well as the Executive Directors to benefit in the Company's success annually.\n\n## Payments for loss of office and payments to past Directors\n\nNicola Shaw stood down from the Board on 26 July 2021 and stayed with the Company until after the conclusion of the RIIO-T2 CMA appeal process and continued as Chair of the Company's subsidiaries, National Grid Electricity Transmission plc and National Grid Gas plc. She remained in active employment until 31 October 2021, after which she was not eligible for 2021/22 APP and received salary and benefits until her final employment date of/uni00A030 April 2022 as per the terms of her contract. Her APP is pro-rated for her period of active employment for 2021/22, i.e. 1 April 2021 to 31 October 2021. Her 2019 LTPP will vest at the normal vesting date of July 2022 subject to performance conditions and is pro-rated for time served to the termination date of 30 April 2022 in accordance with the plan rules.\n\nDetails of Nicola's remuneration in relation to the period 1 April 2021 to 26 July 2021 (qualifying service as an Executive Director) and 27 July 2021 to 31 March 2022 is disclosed in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table on page 114. All payments are in accordance with her service agreement, the/uni00A0Directors' Remuneration Policy (and in line with our June 2021 Corporate Governance disclosure) and subject to applicable tax withholdings.\n\nThe Committee agreed to grant good leaver treatment for Nicola's in-flight LTPP awards given her overall long-term strong performance and contribution to the business. Nicola's awards under the 2020 LTPP will be pro-rated for completed months held since the award date until 30 April 2022. These awards will vest at the same time as other participants, subject to performance measured at the vesting date and any discretion the Committee may decide to exercise at the time of vesting, in line with our Directors' Remuneration Policy. These shares will be subject to the two-year post-vesting holding requirement and post-employment shareholding requirement.\n\nThere have been no payments made to past Directors during 2021/22.\n\n## External appointments and retention of fees\n\nExperience as a board member of another company is considered to be valuable personal development, which in turn is of benefit to the Company. The/uni00A0table below details the Executive Director (at 31 March 2022) who served as non-executive director in other companies during the year ended 31 March 2022:\n\n|                | Company              | Retained fees   |\n|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| John Pettigrew | Rentokil Initial plc | \u00a370,000         |\n\n## Role of Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors, the other members of the Group Executive Committee and the Chair, and for implementing this Policy. The aim is to align the Remuneration Policy to the Company strategy and key business objectives, and ensure it reflects our shareholders', customers' and regulators' interests. The Committee receives input on Policy implementation within the wider workforce before reaching decisions on matters such as salary increases and annual incentive payouts and closely reviews the appropriateness of pay positioning by reference to external measures (benchmarking remuneration packages) and internal review of Company performance and pay gaps (CEO pay ratios, gender and ethnicity pay gaps) and from this year, the relativity year-on-year of salary, benefits and annual performance incentives compared with the same for the rest of the workforce.\n\n- \u00b7 Clarity: we identify and communicate a range of performance measures in our incentives which clearly link to the successful execution of the Company's strategy.\n- \u00b7 Simplicity: elements of our remuneration framework and their purpose are clearly articulated within our market-standard Remuneration Policy and we believe this is understood by all our stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Risk: risk is managed in a number of ways and evidenced through our Remuneration Policy, for example: setting maximum levels for incentive plans; implementing measures that are aligned to Company performance and shareholder interests; focusing on the long term and creating value through the LTPP; reviewing formulaic outcomes; malus and clawback provisions; and having a high shareholding requirement for senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Predictability: full information on the potential values which could be earned are disclosed; our policy outlines threshold, target and maximum opportunity with varying actual incentive outcomes dependent on performance; and all the checks and balances set out above under Risk are disclosed as part of the Remuneration Policy.\n- \u00b7 Proportionality: whilst incentive plans reward executives' performance in successfully delivering the business strategy, there is also a focus on sustaining this through holding periods that apply to vested shares and annual incentives paid out as shares; all executives are also subject to significant shareholding and post-employment shareholding requirements. The policy does not reward poor performance and the range of potential payouts under the Policy is appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Alignment to culture and strategy: our culture recognises that how we do things is as vital as what we do and this is reflected in the type of performance conditions used in our incentive plans. Both the measures themselves and the targets set aim to reinforce this approach.\n\nOur policy has operated as intended in terms of Company performance and quantum; a review of key considerations and decisions pertaining to its implementation is provided in the Committee Chair's statement.",

Our existing Policy (adopted in 2019) continues to function well, providing remuneration outcomes well aligned to Company performance and our shareholders' experience. As such, the 2022 Policy, effective July 2022 subject to shareholder approval, incorporates modest refinements to reflect the importance of the Company's responsible business strategy and ESG goals in both the short and long-term and the increasingly dynamic external context which advantages greater agility and flexibility. We have engaged widely with shareholders and proxy advisory service organisations and are grateful for the engagement, feedback, and positive support on our Policy proposals. The Committee is committed to maintaining an open dialogue and members remain available to answer questions throughout the AGM process and forthcoming year ahead on our 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy as outlined below.\n\n## Policy tables - Executive Directors\n\n| Element                                                                                                    | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Maximum levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Performance  assessment   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Salary Purpose and link to business  strategy: to attract, motivate  and retain high-calibre  individuals. | Salaries are generally reviewed annually and are targeted broadly  at/uni00A0the mid-market of our peer group.

        "page_content": "## continued\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nDirectors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\n## Shareholding requirement - in employment\n\nThe requirement of Executive Directors to build up and hold a significant value of National Grid shares ensures they share a significant level of risk with shareholders and aims to align their interests. Executive Directors are required to build up and retain shares in the Company. The level of holding required is 500% of salary for the CEO and 400% of salary for the other Executive Directors. Unless the shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell shares, other than to pay income tax liabilities on shares just vested or in exceptional circumstances approved by the Committee.\n\n## Shareholding requirement - post employment\n\nThe requirement of Executive Directors to continue to hold National Grid shares after leaving ensures they continue to share a risk with shareholders and maintain alignment with shareholders' interests. Executive Directors will be required to hold 200% of base salary calculated at their leaving date, or maintain their actual holding percentage if lower, expressed as a number of shares and held for a period of two years. This calculation excludes the value of any awards not yet vested for 'good leavers' that will vest according to the normal schedule and which in any event must be held for a two-year period. The calculation will include recently vested LTPP awards or APP awards paid as shares which are subject to respective two-year holding periods, even after employment.\n\nUntil the post-employment shareholding requirement is met, Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell shares, other than to pay income tax liabilities on shares just vested or in exceptional circumstances approved by the Committee.\n\n## Our peer group\n\nThe Committee reviews its Remuneration Policy against appropriate peer groups annually to make sure we remain competitive in the relevant markets. The primary focus for reward market comparisons is currently the FTSE 11 - 40 for UK-based Executive Directors and US general industry and US energy services companies with similar levels of revenue for US-based Executive Directors. These peer groups are considered appropriate for a large, complex, international and predominantly regulated business. The Committee may amend the peer group and reference other peer groups as deemed appropriate.\n\n## Policy tables - Non-executive Directors (NEDs)\n\n## Element\n\n## Operation\n\n## Maximum levels\n\n## Fees for NEDs\n\nPurpose and link to business strategy: to attract NEDs who have a broad range of experience and skills to oversee the implementation of our/uni00A0strategy\n\nNED fees (excluding those of the Chair) are set by the Group Executive Committee in conjunction with the Chair. The Chair fees are set by the Committee.\n\nFee structure:\n\n- \u00b7  Chair fee (all inclusive);\n- \u00b7  basic fee;\n- \u00b7  Committee chair fee;\n- \u00b7  Committee membership fee;\n- \u00b7  Senior Independent Director fee; and\n- \u00b7  additional Board responsibilities.\n\nFees are reviewed every year taking into account those in companies of similar scale and complexity.\n\nThe Chair is eligible to receive benefits as deemed appropriate and necessary in respect of the role, which may include, for example, private medical and personal accident cover, the use of a company car and driver, and financial advice.\n\nNEDs do not participate in incentives, pension or any other benefits. However, they are eligible for reimbursement for all Company-related travel expenses. In/uni00A0instances where these costs are treated by HMRC as taxable benefits, the Company also meets the associated tax cost to the Non-executive Directors through a PAYE settlement agreement with HMRC.\n\nNEDs who also sit on National Grid subsidiary boards may receive additional fees related to service on those boards.\n\n## Legacy arrangements\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Committee may approve payments to satisfy commitments agreed prior to the approval of this Remuneration Policy, for/uni00A0example, those outstanding and unvested incentive awards which have been disclosed to shareholders in previous Remuneration Reports and any commitment made to a person before that person became an Executive Director.\n\n## Operation of the policy\n\nThe Committee reviews annually the overall appropriateness and relevance of the Remuneration Policy and whether any changes should be put to shareholders. Decisions on the measures and targets for performance-related pay (APP and LTPP) and payouts are made taking account of overall financial and business performance. A member of the Audit & Risk Committee is required to be a member of the Committee and this ensures the Committee receives knowledgeable input on setting financial measures and assessing outturns including any adjustments and judgements considered by the Audit/uni00A0&/uni00A0Risk Committee. The Committee also works closely with the People & Governance Committee in respect of pay and conditions of newly appointed Directors to ensure their remuneration is within Policy. The Committee will also link in with the Employee Share Schemes Sub-Committee as required. Consistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, members of the Remuneration Committee are independent Non-executive Directors who do not receive any variable remuneration and do not participate in decisions about their own remuneration.\n\nThere are no prescribed maximum fee levels although fee increases are generally aligned to salary increases received by other Company employees and market movement for NEDs of companies of similar scale and complexity.\n\nThe cost of benefits provided to the Chair is not subject to a predetermined maximum since the purchase cost will vary from year to year.\n\nPerformance metrics, weighting and time period/uni00A0applicable\n\nNot applicable.",

        "page_content": "## Other features of the Remuneration Policy\n\n## Policy on recruitment remuneration\n\nSalaries for new Executive Directors appointed to the Board will be set in accordance with the terms of the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment, and in particular will take account the appointee's skills, experience and the scope and assessment of the market rate for the role.\n\nWhere appropriate, salaries may be set below market level initially, with the Committee retaining discretion to award increases in salary in excess of the wider workforce and inflation to progressively bring the salary up to the market level over time, where this is justified by individual and Company performance. Any such increases will be disclosed accordingly, along with a supporting rationale where appropriate.\n\nBenefits consistent with those offered to other Executive Directors under the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment will be offered, taking account of local market practice. The Committee may also agree that the Company will meet certain recruitment costs, for example legal fees, certain relocation expenses or provide tax equalisation as appropriate.\n\nPension contributions for new Executive Directors appointed to the Board will be set in accordance with the terms of the approved Remuneration Policy in/uni00A0force at the time of appointment.\n\nOngoing incentive pay (APP and LTPP) for new Executive Directors will be in accordance with the approved Remuneration Policy in force at the time of appointment. This means the normal maximum APP award in any year would be 125% of salary and the normal maximum LTPP award would be 350% of salary for the CEO and 300% of salary for other Executive Directors. In exceptional recruitment circumstances, the Committee has the flexibility to award up to an additional 50% of basic salary as incentive pay and this can be applied across the APP/LTPP in any given year but for one year only. The/uni00A0total maximum variable pay in any year will be 525%, excluding any buyout awards.\n\nFor an externally appointed Executive Director, the Company may offer additional cash or share-based payments that it considers necessary to buy out current entitlements from the former employer that will be lost on recruitment to National Grid. Any such arrangements would, so far as practicable, reflect the delivery mechanisms, time horizons and levels of conditionality of the remuneration lost. In order to facilitate buy-out arrangements, existing incentive arrangements will be used to the extent possible, although awards may also be granted outside of these shareholder-approved schemes if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.\n\nFor an internally appointed Executive Director, any outstanding APP awards will be determined according to the original terms but paid at the end of the year. Any outstanding LTPP awards will be paid according to the original terms.\n\nFees for a new Chair or Non-executive Director will be set in line with the approved Policy in force at the time of appointment.\n\n## Service contracts/letters of appointment\n\nIn line with our Policy, all Executive Directors have service contracts which are terminable by either party with 12 months' notice commencing immediately after announcement. Non-executive Directors are subject to letters of appointment. The Board Chair's appointment is subject to six months' notice by either party; for other Non-executive Directors, notice is one month. Both Executive Directors and Non-executive Directors are required to be re-elected at each/uni00A0AGM.\n\nExamples of circumstances which could trigger 'good leaver' treatment include: redundancy, retirement, illness, injury, disability and death. In these circumstances, awards will be released to the departing Executive Director or, in the case of death, to their estate. Long-term share plan awards held by 'good leavers' will normally vest, subject to performance measured at the normal vesting date and be reduced pro-rata for completed time of service starting on the date of grant, as per the plan rules. Such awards would vest at the same time as for other participants, apart from circumstances in which the award recipient has died, in which case the awards may vest as soon as practicable (based on a forecast of performance).\n\nAt the Committee's discretion, the Company may also agree other payments such as an agreed amount for legal fees associated with the departure of the Executive Director and outplacement support.\n\nNo compensation would be paid for loss of office of Directors on a change of control of the Company.\n\nNo compensation is payable to the Chair or Non-executive Directors if they are required to stand down or are not re-elected at the AGM.\n\nCopies of Directors' service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\n## Policy on payment for loss of office\n\nThe contracts contain provisions for payment in lieu of notice, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company. Such contractual payments are limited to payment of salary only for the remainder of the notice period. In the UK, such payments would usually be phased on a monthly basis, over a period not greater than 12 months, and the Executive Director would be expected to mitigate any losses where employment is taken up during the notice period. In the US, for tax compliance purposes, the policy is to make any payment in lieu of notice as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within two and a half months of the later of 31 December and 31 March immediately following the notice date.\n\nIn the event of a UK Director's role becoming redundant, statutory compensation would apply and the relevant pension plan rules may result in the early payment of an unreduced pension. On termination of employment, no APP award would generally be payable. However, the Committee has the discretion to deem an individual to be a 'good leaver', in which case a pro-rata discretionary payment could be paid, based on performance (as measured at the end of the financial year) and the achievement of individual objectives during the financial year up to termination.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Report continued\n\nDirectors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\nIn the UK, any discretionary payment would generally be paid at the normal time. In the US the payment may be made earlier if required for tax compliance purposes, in which case the Committee would apply discretion to determine an appropriate level of financial performance. Examples of circumstances which could trigger 'good leaver' treatment include redundancy, retirement, illness, injury, disability and death. The Committee may apply discretion to determine if any pro-rata discretionary payment should be made sooner than it would normally be paid, for example, in the case of death.\n\nOn termination of employment, outstanding awards under the share plans will be treated in accordance with the relevant plan rules approved by shareholders. Unvested share awards would normally lapse. 'Good leaver' provisions apply at the Committee's discretion and in specified circumstances.\n\n## External appointments\n\nExecutive Directors may, with the approval of the Board, accept one external appointment as a Non-executive Director of another company and retain any fees received for the appointment. Experience as a board member of another company is considered to be valuable personal development, which in turn is of benefit to the Company.\n\n## Corporate and share capital events\n\nThe Group's employee share plans (including the LTPP) contain standard provisions that allow awards (and where relevant their exercise prices) to be adjusted, or in some cases vest or be exchanged, on the occurrence of a corporate or share capital event such as a capitalisation or rights issue, sub-division, consolidation or reduction of share capital, demerger, special dividend or distribution, listing or change of control, normally at the discretion of the Committee.\n\n## Total remuneration opportunity\n\nThe total remuneration for each of the Executive Directors that could result from the 2022 Remuneration Policy under three different performance levels (below threshold, when only fixed pay is receivable, on target and maximum) is shown below. The maximum receivable assuming 50% share price growth (or a reduction) in LTPP awards over a three-year performance period, and the basis for this calculation, is set out in the notes below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.   Fixed pay consists of salary, pension and benefits in kind as provided under the Remuneration Policy. Salary is that to be paid in 2022/23, taking account of the increases that/uni00A0will be effective from 1 July 2022 as shown on page 129. Benefits in kind and pension are as shown in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table for 2021/22 on page/uni00A0114.\n- 2.   APP calculations are based on 125% of salary for the period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023. APP payout is 0% for threshold performance, 50% for on-target performance and the maximum of 100% is for achieving stretch.\n- 3.   LTPP calculations are based on awards with a face value of 350% of 1 July 2022 salary for John Pettigrew and 300% of 1 July 2022 salary for Andy Agg. LTPP payout is/uni00A020% for threshold performance and the maximum of 100% is for achieving stretch and straight line vesting between. Excludes changes in share price and dividend/uni00A0equivalents.\n- 4.   For LTPP calculations, assuming either a 50% share price growth (or reduction) over the three-year performance period, the increase (or decrease) in LTPP value and maximum total compensation for each of the Executive Directors would be (all amounts expressed as \u00a3'000):\n- \u00b7 John Pettigrew: LTI value would increase (or decrease) from \u00a33,824 to \u00a35,736 (or \u00a31,912) and maximum total compensation would rise (or reduce) from \u00a36,628 to \u00a38,540 (or \u00a34,716) respectively\n- \u00b7 Andy Agg: LTI value would increase (or decrease) from \u00a32,157 to \u00a33,236 (or \u00a31,079) and maximum total compensation would rise (or reduce) from \u00a33,930 to \u00a35,008 (or/uni00A0\u00a32,809) respectively.\n\n## Consideration of remuneration policy elsewhere in the Company\n\nThe design and implementation of executive remuneration takes into consideration the wider workforce context and remuneration strategy to ensure they are mutually reinforcing. Our executive Remuneration Policy is well aligned to policies for our non-unionised workforce, and the Committee actively considers employee feedback and views on executive pay. The Company issues an employee engagement survey each year, which includes remuneration as a topic, and regularly engages with employees on a variety of topics including remuneration to ensure employees have an opportunity to share their feedback and views.\n\nAll employees are entitled to base salary, benefits, and pension contributions. The approach to assessing salaries, benefits, pensions and other elements of remuneration is consistent across the Group with an objective to ensure they remain competitive at relevant mid-market levels for all job bands/roles, including roles that are subject to union negotiation. We are pleased to report that National Grid continues to be accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a real Living Wage employer for our UK businesses (excluding the recent acquisition of WPD). Further plans and efforts are underway to achieve equivalent accreditations for WPD and the rest of our global businesses in the US.\n\nMiddle to senior leaders are eligible to participate in our long-term incentive plans either through performance share awards or restricted share awards (under the LTPP) to incentivise and reward their individual contributions toward the Company's longer-term strategic priorities. Performance measures for the LTPP are consistent with measures set for Executive Directors to ensure strong alignment and focus on the Company's strategic goals.\n\nAcross the wider workforce, a greater emphasis and focus is placed on delivery of the Company's annual operational and financial business plans. As/uni00A0such, the majority of employees are eligible to participate in the APP. Performance measures for annual incentives are cascaded through the organisation and designed to ensure they incentive elements of business performance within an individual's control and are aligned to employee's annual goals. All Company employees are encouraged to become shareholders through a number of all-employee share plans and a significant proportion of our employees participate annually. These plans include Sharesave and the SIP in the UK and the 401(k) and 423(b) plans in the US which are summarised on page 124.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2022/23\n\nThe Remuneration Policy to be adopted at the 2022 AGM, subject to shareholder approval, will be implemented during 2022/23 as outlined below:\n\n## Salary and pensions\n\nSalary increases will normally be in line with the increase awarded to other employees in the UK and the US, subject to performance. Higher salary increases may also be awarded for a change in responsibility. Additionally, in line with the Policy on recruitment remuneration, salaries for new directors may be set below market level initially and aligned to market level over time (provided the increase is merited by the individual's contribution and performance).\n\nAs explained in the Chair's statement, for 2022 a salary increase of 3.75% for John Pettigrew and 6.5% for Andy Agg will be awarded, effective from 1 July/uni00A02022.\n\n|                | From 1 July 2022   | From 1 July 2021   | % increase   |\n|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| John Pettigrew | \u00a31,092,500         | \u00a31,053,000         | 3.75%        |\n| Andy Agg       | \u00a3719,000           | \u00a3675,000           | 6.5%         |\n\nThe pension contribution for new and existing Executive Directors has been set to 12% effective 1 April 2022, in line with pension contribution rates for the UK wider workforce.\n\n## 2022/23 Annual Performance Plan\n\nThe 2022/23 APP measures will be split across financial measures, operational measures and individual objectives, weighted 70%, 15% and 15% respectively. The increase in the financial element of the APP this year reflects a balancing of operational measures which total 15% (versus 20% in 2021/22) and individual objectives which total 15% (versus 20% in 2021/22). The maximum APP award for both the Executive Directors for 2022/23 is/uni00A0125% of basic salary, in line with the Policy, subject to shareholder approval.\n\n|                       | Measure                                                                                        | Weighting   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial measures    | Underlying EPS                                                                                 | 35%         |\n|                       | Group RoE                                                                                      | 35%         |\n| Operational measures  | Customers: Group Customer Satisfaction Index                                                   | 5%          |\n|                       | Colleagues: Group Having a Voice Index                                                         | 5%          |\n|                       | Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion: % Diversity of Strategic Leadership Group (top ~110 leaders) | 5%          |\n| Individual objectives | Individual objectives                                                                          | 15%         |\n\n## Financial measures\n\nUnderlying EPS and Group RoE have been retained as financial measures in the 2022/23 APP. In both measures for remuneration purposes, the part year/uni00A0contributions of UK Gas Transmission are included in the performance targets. Group RoE remains a relevant and key measure of performance as a/uni00A0primarily regulated asset-based company. In the short-term (APP), Group RoE targets are set to ensure strong in year returns and operational results. An 'annual profit' measure in the APP also remains key, given in particular the importance of regulated earnings to the business strategy. Underlying EPS is a well-understood and established measure internally and externally, and as such remains the most appropriate APP earnings measure for the business. Similar to Group RoE, annual target setting considers specific challenges and opportunities in the year ahead and is flexed accordingly whilst remaining consistent with our longer-term performance goals. Financial APP targets are considered commercially sensitive and consequently will be disclosed in the 2022/23 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## Operational measures\n\nThe 2022/23 APP operational measures are designed to incentivise key annual priorities aligned to the Company's strategy as a responsible business and broader ESG goals and are weighted equally across three key measures focused on customers, colleagues and DEI. Operational measures will continue to be assessed on a four-point scale (not met, partially achieved, achieved and over-achieved) based on quantifiable targets and qualitative outcomes to reflect a balanced assessment of performance.\n\nThe Group Customer Satisfaction Index is an equally weighted index of quantifiable and predominantly externally measured customer satisfaction scores/ measures across each of the Company's business units. The inclusion of a customer measure in the APP reflects the strategic importance and focus on delivering excellent service and business outcomes for customers. The colleague 'Having a Voice' measure is a quantitative Group wide index from our annual Company-wide employee survey of more than 30,000 colleagues. The index measures the level of transparency and cultural openness in the organisation - a key area of focus for us. Specifically, the year ahead will maintain a strong focus on embedding the Company's purpose, values, and culture as part of the deeper integration of WPD as well as continue to evolve the culture and ways of working across the Group. The diversity measure is a quantifiable target for the level of diversity in the strategic leadership group (SLG ~ top 110) in line with a key strategic priority to build a strong, diverse, and inclusive strategic leadership team and pipeline of talent to support the delivery of the Company's strategy.\n\n## Individual objectives\n\nThe Committee has approved individual objectives for the Executive Directors in line with key strategic and operational priorities for the year ahead. John Pettigrew's individual objectives for 2022/23 are focused on: 1) delivery of the enterprise-wide transformation; 2) execution of the Company and Board's strategic blueprint; and 3) development and progression of a diverse, inclusive, strategic leadership group talent and capabilities. Andy Agg's annual performance objectives are focused on: 1) management of the portfolio repositioning, credit strategy, and investor sentiment; 2) achievement of key regulatory outcomes (ED2) and performance; and 3) progression of the Finance function's transformation and talent agenda.",

Subject to approval by the shareholders at the 2022 AGM, the 2022 Remuneration Policy and the LTPP plan rules (approved at the July 2021 AGM that reflect updates to align to market practice and good governance, in particular for malus and clawback provisions) would apply to the 2022 LTPP awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                              | Measure                                                                  | Weighting   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial measures           | Cumulative three-year Underlying EPS                                     | 40%         |\n|                              | Group RoE                                                                | 40%         |\n| Net zero transition measures | National Grid Scope 1 emissions                                          | 10%         |\n| Net zero transition measures | Enablement of net zero transition: Strategic initiatives (Scope 2 and 3) | 10%         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDenotes an 'alternative performance measure' as described on pages 268 - 279\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial measures\n\nLTPP financial measures are selected to reflect key drivers of the Company's longer-term strategy and value creation for shareholders. Given the primarily regulated and long-term nature of our businesses, earnings growth and sustainable investment returns are important measures of long-term shareholder value creation. Whilst we recognise our short-term (APP) and long-term (LTPP) financial measures are similar, we believe these are the right measures to support delivery of the business strategy and the resultant creation of shareholder value. The combination of annual and long-term earnings and returns measures act together to incentivise strong operational delivery in a year, and long-term efficient asset growth and a sustainable dividend. As such, the/uni00A02022 LTPP financial measures are designed to incentivise different elements of performance over the long term as compared to the short term. Specifically in LTPP, Group RoE is averaged across the three-year performance period with targets set to ensure the company delivers sustainable performance for shareholders. Similarly, the Underlying EPS measure is a cumulative measure that sums Underlying EPS for the three years in/uni00A0the LTPP performance period and sets out to incentivise sustainable long-term earnings growth and value creation for shareholders. As such, LTPP Underlying EPS targets have been set in line with the Company's five-year investor frame with target performance aligned to/uni00A0the top end of the range. The LTPP Underlying EPS measure will not be subject to the technical adjustments made in annual Group EPS measure.\n\nBelow are the performance ranges for the financial measures in the 2022 LTPP. The targets have been set in consideration of the forthcoming RIIO-ED2 final determination, the portfolio transactions and the Company's forward Strategic Business Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Financial performance measures         | Weighting   | Threshold  20% vesting   | Maximum  100% vesting   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Cumulative 3 year Underlying Group EPS | 40%         | 199 p                    | 217 p                   |\n| Group RoE                              | 40%         | 9.50%                    | 10.75%                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNotes: Vesting between threshold and maximum will be on a straight-line basis. The calculation for the Group RoE measure will reflect the updated methodology from 2021/22 going forward as outlined on page 277 of the Annual Report. Targets assume UK Gas Transmission minority stake is treated as a discontinued operation from start of 2023/24. Underlying EPS growth reflects the cumulative summation of the Underlying EPS results for each of the three years in the performance period; 2022/23, 2023/24 and 2024/25.\n\n## Net zero transition measures\n\nThe net zero transition measures set out targets and outcomes to achieve 1) reductions in the Company's direct Scope 1 emissions and 2) enable the broader net zero energy transition to achieve reductions in Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions through greater reliance on low carbon/renewable energy sources in line with goals set out in our RBC.\n\nThe reduction of Scope 1 emissions target is a cumulative measure aligned to meet the Company's 2030 goals and the SBTi (Science Based Target initiative) well below 2 \u00b0 C pathway. The Scope 1 reduction target excludes Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) generation asset emissions as management do not have direct control over decisions to run the assets. In recent years, LIPA operation has been well above predicted levels driven by regional factors including availability of local supply. Broader considerations and actions regarding the longer term for LIPA have been incorporated into the second measure as part of enabling the net zero transition.\n\n| Net zero transition measures   | Weighting   | Threshold  20% vesting   | Maximum  100% vesting   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Reduction of Scope 1 emissions | 10%         | -50 ktCO2e               | -117 ktCO2e             |\n\nNote: Target represents cumulative savings as measured against the 2022 Scope 1 emissions baseline. These targets include best current estimates of the addition of WPD and removal of the UK Gas Transmission and US Rhode Island businesses.",

This measure will assess delivery against key net zero strategic priorities and quantified outcomes that underpin the Company's strategy to enable a net zero future by 2050. There are four/uni00A0key areas of focus; 1) US energy-efficiency programmes and generation; 2) UK net zero transmission strategy including interconnectors and transmission investment to connect offshore wind; 3) US future of gas strategy including the transition to renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen, and hybrid/electrification of heat; and 4) low-carbon electricity distribution investment in line with government and regulatory plans. Assessment of this measure will be based on a four-point scale (not met, partially achieved, achieved and over-achieved) based on delivery of quantifiable and qualitative outcomes to reflect a balanced assessment of performance.\n\n## Fees for NEDs\n\nNon-executive Director fees were reviewed mid-year in light of the Board Committee and membership changes to ensure alignment to the market and simplify the fee structure.

        "page_content": "## Statement of Directors' responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Accounts, including the Group financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and/uni00A0regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the UK. The financial statements also comply with IFRS as issued by the IASB. In addition, the Directors have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. Under company law, the Directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Parent Company and of the profit or loss of the Group and Parent Company for that period.\n\nIn preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:\n\n- \u00b7  properly select and apply accounting policies;\n- \u00b7  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- \u00b7  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance; and\n- \u00b7  make an assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and/uni00A0prudent;\n- \u00b7  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group and Parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and Parent Company on a consolidated and/uni00A0individual basis, and to enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the Directors in office at the date of the approval of this Report are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware and each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 88/uni00A0- 89, confirms that:\n\n- \u00b7  to the best of their knowledge, the Group financial statements and the Parent Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the UK and UK GAAP FRS 101 respectively, give a true and fair view of/uni00A0the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Company on a/uni00A0consolidated and individual basis;\n- \u00b7  to the best of their knowledge, the Strategic Report contained in the Annual Report and Accounts includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company on a/uni00A0consolidated and individual basis, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and\n- \u00b7  they consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThis Responsibilities Statement was approved by the Board and signed on/uni00A0its behalf.\n\n## Directors' Report\n\nThe Directors' Report, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules, and Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules, comprising pages 1 - 131 and 242 - 288, was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\n## Strategic Report\n\nThe Strategic Report, comprising pages 1 - 83, was approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Justine Campbell Group General Counsel & Company Secretary\n\n18 May 2022\n\nCompany number: 04031152",

Opinion\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7  the financial statements of National Grid plc (the 'Parent Company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2022 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);\n- \u00b7  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' ; and\n- \u00b7  the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements which comprise:\n\n## Group:\n\n- \u00b7  the consolidated income statement;\n- \u00b7  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7  the consolidated statement of changes in equity;\n- \u00b7  the consolidated statement of financial position;\n- \u00b7  the consolidated cash flow statement; and\n- \u00b7  the related notes 1 to 38 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Summary of our audit approach\n\nMateriality\n\nScoping\n\nKey audit matters\n\nThe key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:\n\n- \u00b7  Acquisition of Western Power Distribution (WPD) and impairment testing of the related WPD goodwill; and\n- \u00b7  Impact of climate change on property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe following items were identified as key audit matters in the prior year but not in the current year:\n\n- \u00b7  'Impact of COVID-19 including the recoverability of US trade and other receivables' has not been deemed to be a key audit matter this year as the impact is now well understood and there is a reduction in uncertainty. This reduces the impact on accounting judgements and on the way that we perform our audit; and\n- \u00b7  'Treasury derivative transactions' has not been deemed a key audit matter this year. Although we continue to undertake a/uni00A0substantial amount of work to audit the Group's large Treasury function, there have been no significant matters identified in either the current or prior year, meaning we believe this can now be considered a/uni00A0more routine area of the audit.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of WPD during the year, we identified the acquisition accounting of WPD and the subsequent impairment testing of the goodwill recognised on acquisition as a key audit matter, given the size of the acquisition and the judgements applied by management in both the purchase price allocation (PPA) and the goodwill impairment testing.\n\nThe materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was \u00a3135 million which represents 4.9% of adjusted profit before tax (profit before tax from continuing operations, excluding the impact of reported exceptional items and remeasurements) and 4.1% of statutory profit before tax.\n\nOur scope covered eight components of the Group in addition to procedures performed at the Group level. Of/uni00A0these, five were subjected to a full-scope audit whilst the remaining three were subject to specific procedures on certain account balances.\n\nOur scoping covered 97% of the Group's revenue; 93% of the Group's profit before tax; and 98% of the Group's net assets.\n\n## Parent Company:\n\n- \u00b7  the Company accounting policies;\n- \u00b7  the Company balance sheet;\n- \u00b7  the Company statement of changes in equity; and\n- \u00b7  the related notes 1 to 10 to the Company financial statements.\n\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of/uni00A0the Group financial statements is applicable law, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRS as issued by the IASB. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## 2. Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the/uni00A0audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group and the Parent Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group and Parent Company for the year are disclosed in note 4e to the consolidated financial statements and note 10 to the Company financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services that are prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent/uni00A0Company.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.",

Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting/uni00A0included:\n\n- \u00b7  assessing the financing facilities including the nature of facilities, repayment terms and covenants;\n- \u00b7  enquiring of management regarding the assumptions used in the going concern model;\n- \u00b7  testing the clerical accuracy and appropriateness of the model used to prepare the forecasts;\n- \u00b7  assessing the assumptions used in the forecasts;\n- \u00b7  assessing management's identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment;\n- \u00b7  assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management;\n- \u00b7  reading analyst reports, industry data and other external information to determine if it provided corroborative or contradictory evidence in relation to assumptions used;\n- \u00b7  reperforming management's sensitivity analysis; and\n- \u00b7  evaluating the disclosures made within the financial statements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of/uni00A0accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## 5.1 Acquisition of WPD and impairment testing of the related WPD goodwill\n\nKey audit matter/uni00A0description\n\nAccount balance: Property, plant and equipment (PPE), Other intangible assets, Borrowings and Goodwill. Refer to notes 1F, 11, 35 and 37 to the financial statements and the Audit & Risk Committee's discussion on pages 101 - 105. Acquisition of WPD (referred to as 'UK Electricity Distribution')\n\nThe acquisition of WPD completed on 14 June 2021. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an Initial Enforcement Order (IEO) which required the WPD group to continue to be run independently from National Grid until it had completed its reviews. The CMA reviews were completed on 1 September 2021, at which point the restrictions put in place by the IEO were removed. The IEO restrictions meant there was judgement regarding the point at which National Grid assumed control of WPD. Management concluded that, based on the evaluated evidence, they assumed control from 14 June 2021 and consolidated WPD from that date.\n\nManagement, with support from third-party experts, performed an exercise to fair value the assets and liabilities acquired at the/uni00A0date of acquisition. The key balance sheet items fair valued included:\n\n- \u00b7  PPE valued at \u00a310,051 million, which implied a step-down of \u00a34,026 million relative to the book value acquired. This represents a combination of an accounting adjustment to remove deferred customer contributions and a fair value step-down;\n- \u00b7  licence intangible assets of \u00a31,714 million; attributed to the licences to operate for each of the distribution network operators (DNOs) acquired; and\n- \u00b7  non-current borrowings of \u00a37,556 million; an increase of \u00a31,589 million on pre-acquisition book value.\n\nThe difference between the consideration paid (\u00a37,881 million) and the net fair values of the identified assets and liabilities acquired (\u00a33,160 million) is recorded as goodwill of \u00a34,721 million. Management concluded this represents the future expected growth of the WPD business, expected synergies from combining the business with National Grid and the expertise of the management team acquired.\n\nThe most significant judgements related to the allocation of value between PPE, the acquired licence intangibles and the residual goodwill recorded.\n\nThe fair value of the PPE assets was determined based on cash flows related to the existing asset base, including estimates regarding future expected outperformance, maintenance and replacement expenditure and regulatory returns. Given there is no future cash inflow related to assets which were funded by customer contributions, this resulted in an accounting adjustment of \u00a32,754 million.\n\nThe fair value of the licence intangible assets was determined based on discounting the incremental cash flows relating to the licence. These cash flows were calculated by subtracting the cash flows attributable to PPE and goodwill from the cash flows for the business as a whole. The licence cash flows are dependent on multiple key assumptions including future expected outperformance, synergies, capital expenditure and regulatory returns which are subject to a high degree of/uni00A0uncertainty.",

Performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of management's determination of the acquisition date and the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\n\n## WPD goodwill impairment\n\nFollowing the finalisation of the PPA, the WPD goodwill balance of \u00a34,721 million was tested for impairment in line with the requirement in IAS 36 to perform an impairment review annually, starting in the year of acquisition. Due to volatility caused by macroeconomic events in the last three months of this financial year, management tested goodwill as at 31 March 2022 but will revert to 31 December in future periods.\n\nAs set out in note 11 to the financial statements, management prepared a discounted cash flow model to estimate the value-in-use and compared this to the carrying value; this indicated there was headroom and accordingly no impairment was recognised. The value-in-use was measured at the group of cash-generating units (CGU) level and the calculation was derived from multiple inputs to the model.\n\nWe performed risk assessment procedures and identified three key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Totex forecasts - The model used for the impairment test leverages the cash flow forecasts from the fair value allocation exercise and extends to 2050. Management forecast negative cash flows for a number of years due to the level of investment required to reinforce the networks to meet expected electricity demand in order to achieve the Company's and the UK's target to become net zero by 2050. The future forecast expenditure is therefore dependent on the increased demand for low-carbon technologies ('LCTs') including electric vehicles (EVs) and heat pumps which will require more connections on the distribution network. Given there are a number of potential pathways for the energy transition to 2050, including the extent of/uni00A0electrification, there is uncertainty in the level of future totex required.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - Management utilised a pre-tax discount rate of 5.2%. The discount rate should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted and accordingly should be independent of the actual capital structure of the business being assessed and the way in which the acquisition of the business was financed. There is a risk that management did not apply a reasonable discount rate, leading to a material misstatement of goodwill.\n- \u00b7 Terminal value - In order to calculate the value of the business at the end of the forecast period in 2050, management have assumed an 'exit multiple' of Regulatory Asset Value (RAV) at that date. This is the equivalent of a/uni00A0nominal growth rate in perpetuity of 2.5%.\n\nChanges in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value and the amount of any impairment charge.\n\nThe impairment test of WPD goodwill involved significant assumptions including those used in the selection of the discount rate and the terminal value. Auditing these assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgement and increased extent of effort, including the need to involve more senior members of the team and our fair value specialists.\n\n## Acquisition of WPD\n\nWe have tested the controls over the accounting for the acquisition of WPD. This has included testing the review controls over the valuations and management's challenge of the estimates made.\n\nWe challenged the reasonableness of management's judgement regarding the date from when they assumed control, including reading correspondence with the regulators and the terms of the IEO, as well as searching for any contradictory evidence.\n\nIn respect of the overall acquired balance sheet, we:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied in valuing the acquired assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7  determined the reasonableness of the values attributed to acquired assets and liabilities, with input from our valuations, tax, treasury and pension specialists;\n- \u00b7  read the share purchase agreement; and\n- \u00b7  vouched the consideration paid to bank statements.\n\nIn challenging management's judgements and estimates relating to the fair value allocations to PPE, intangible assets and goodwill, we:\n\n- \u00b7  evaluated the fair value methodology used by management's experts, with input from our valuation specialists;\n- \u00b7  assessed the competence and objectivity of management's experts;\n- \u00b7  tested the integrity of the model used in determining the fair values; and\n- \u00b7  compared significant assumptions to externally sourced information including from the regulator and other government bodies.\n\nWe also evaluated the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\n## WPD goodwill impairment\n\nWe tested the controls over management's impairment review performed for the WPD business. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Totex forecasts\n\n- \u00b7  We understood the key totex assumptions in the model and challenged the basis of these by benchmarking the assumptions against third-party and relevant industry publications to inform our assessment of the nature, timing and extent of expected electrification in the UK.\n- \u00b7  We evaluated the competence and objectivity of the third-party experts used by management to develop the totex forecasts.",

This is a reasonable assumption; however, should there be a significant change in the stability of the regulatory model that governs the performance of electricity distribution operators this could result in an impairment, as set out in note 11 to the financial statements.\n\n## Totex forecasts\n\nFor the purpose of the impairment test management has used forecasts for totex which represent a reasonable view of the extent of expected electrification in targeting net zero when compared with a range of scenarios in the public domain.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nManagement's pre-tax discount rate of 5.2% is towards the low end of the reasonable range determined by our specialists. The/uni00A0rate is a highly sensitive assumption and an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 50 basis points would result in an impairment of \u00a31,033 million, as set out in note 35 to the financial statements.\n\n## Terminal value\n\nThe RAV-based exit multiple used to determine the terminal value (equivalent to a 2.5% nominal growth rate in perpetuity) is/uni00A0within the reasonable range of multiples we have determined based on our assessment of historical market transactions. The/uni00A0value-in-use calculation is very sensitive to the terminal value as it represents 98% of the value-in-use on a post-tax basis. Reducing the terminal value to a level consistent with a 2% in perpetuity nominal growth rate would eliminate the headroom.\n\n## Discount rate\n\n- \u00b7  We engaged our valuation specialists to develop an independent range for a reasonable discount rate using relevant third-party market and peer data for the WPD business. We compared management's calculated rate to our reasonable/uni00A0range.\n\n## Terminal value\n\n- \u00b7  We independently developed a reasonable range of RAV-based exit multiples using external data obtained for historical market transaction values.\n- \u00b7  We independently recalculated the equivalent long-term nominal growth rate to assess the reasonableness of the rate compared to long-term growth forecasts for the UK economy.\n\n## Other\n\n- \u00b7  We assessed whether the impairment methodology applied by management was acceptable under IFRS and tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment model.\n- \u00b7  We evaluated all key inputs, assumptions and datasets used in the model by benchmarking information to different industry and third-party publications.\n- \u00b7  We assessed the accuracy of management's short-term forecasts by comparing to the latest historical financial information for WPD.\n- \u00b7  We assessed whether management's impairment forecasts are consistent with other forecasts used by management, including the RIIO-ED2 business plan submitted to Ofgem.\n- \u00b7  We evaluated all changes to key assumptions between the model used for the PPA exercise and the goodwill impairment/uni00A0test.\n- \u00b7  We challenged management's disclosures in notes 1F, 11, 35 and 37 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate and terminal value disclosures.",

Refer to notes 1F and 13 to the financial statements and the Audit & Risk Committee's discussion on pages/uni00A0101 - 105.\n\nThe UK government and certain US states in which the Group operates have enacted legislation and established targets in respect of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Accordingly climate change represents a strategic challenge for the Group, which has also set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the same date.\n\nNatural gas, when burned, emits carbon dioxide and is considered a greenhouse gas. Therefore, the strategic challenge relates to the potential future use of the Group's gas assets, which are used to facilitate gas transmission services in the UK and gas distribution services in the US in the period approaching 2050 and beyond. However, the Group announced the sale of the UK gas transmission business in March 2022 and since August 2021, it has been held for sale with the transaction expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022/23. Accordingly, the useful lives of the UK gas transmission assets are no longer a risk for the Group and do not materially impact the results for the year. Therefore, our focus has been on the useful economic life of the Group's gas assets in the US, which is up to 80 years, extending well beyond the 2050 net zero commitment date.\n\nAs the continued use of natural gas as a primary energy source beyond 2050 appears to be in conflict with net zero targets and the impact of shortening the useful lives of the gas assets to 2050 has a material impact on annual depreciation, there is an audit risk that management judgements taken to determine useful lives of US gas assets in the context of the net zero commitments are not reasonable.\n\nAs described in note 13 to the financial statements, the impact of changing the useful economic lives of the gas assets in the US, such that they would be fully depreciated by 2050, would be an increase in the annual depreciation expense of \u00a3180 million.\n\nThe Group announced in April 2022 that it is planning to eliminate fossil fuels from its gas and electric systems in New York state and Massachusetts by 2050, by decarbonising the gas network through the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) and green hydrogen. This commitment to eliminate entirely, fossil fuels from the gas network by 2050, includes clear and measurable internal milestones in the period up to 2050.\n\nBoth New York and Massachusetts, the largest states in which the Group operates, announced climate action plans proposing that nearly all households change their heating systems to electricity by 2050. Management's vision, which will require legislative and regulatory support to implement, proposes a hybrid approach that they believe will enable customers to have more affordable energy solutions and allow customers to retain choice in how to achieve net zero.\n\nAlthough there are challenges and uncertainties around the sufficiency of RNG supply, as well as around the cost effectiveness and production of green hydrogen, as they are early stage technologies, management is of the view that a hybrid electric-gas heating system approach will be a practical and achievable pathway to meet the state and regional decarbonisation goals as well as the most affordable, reliable and practical solution to reduce emissions. This hybrid approach would mean there would be a need for the majority of the Group's US gas assets in the long term and hence there will be no need to shorten their useful economic lives.\n\nManagement operated a control to assess the accounting impacts associated with climate change, including on the useful lives of the Group's US gas assets, to ensure these are considered and reflected appropriately in the financial statements.\n\nManagement determined that disclosure of a key judgement in relation to the potential future use of the US gas assets post 2050 and disclosure of the gas asset lives as a key estimate (note 1F to the financial statements), with sensitivity analysis (note 13 to the financial statements), was appropriate.",

Accordingly, in the US, the IFRS asset depreciable lives are identical to those agreed by the Group's regulators for regulatory/uni00A0purposes.\n\nWe note that whilst state energy policy in the US states in which the Group operates is codified by the legislature, it is the regulators who are charged with implementing state energy policies. We concluded it was reasonable to assume that there will/uni00A0be a valuable use for the Group's US gas assets beyond 2050 and in the absence of any determination by the Group's regulators, it continues to be reasonable to use the regulatory asset lives for the calculation of depreciation in accordance with/uni00A0IFRS.\n\nWe consider the disclosures in note 1 to the financial statements and the sensitivity analysis in note 13 to the financial statements to be appropriate.\n\nWe are satisfied that management's other disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts relating to the uncertainty surrounding the future use of the Group's gas assets are consistent with the financial statements and our understanding of the business.",

We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                   | Group financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Parent Company financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Materiality       | \u00a3135 million (2021: \u00a3120 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | \u00a3135 million (2021: \u00a3100 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Rationale for the | items and remeasurements as disclosed in the consolidated  income statement.

We also report to the Audit & Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## 7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## 7.1 Identification and scoping of components\n\nOur audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment and assessing the risks of material misstatements at the Group level. We used data analytics tools and specialists to help inform our understanding of the business, identify key risk areas and evaluate the level of audit coverage required.\n\nThe UK Electricity Transmission, UK Gas Transmission, UK Electricity System Operator, UK Electricity Distribution and US regulated (comprising the New York and New England business units) components were subject to a full-scope audit for Group reporting purposes, completed to the individual component materiality levels set out below.\n\nIn addition to the above components subject to full scope audit procedures by the component teams, we have identified three other business units which form part of National Grid Ventures and Other, where we consider there to be a reasonable possibility of material misstatement in specific items within the financial statements: National Grid Ventures UK, Genco and UK Property. Accordingly, we have directed component auditors to perform specific audit procedures in relation to material account balances and analytical procedures on the respective income statements and statements of/uni00A0financial position for these components.\n\n| Business unit                                      | Audit scope                         | Component materiality   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| UK Electricity Transmission                        | Full-scope audit                    | \u00a348 million             |\n| UK Gas Transmission                                | Full-scope audit                    | \u00a343 million             |\n| UK Electricity System Operator                     | Full-scope audit                    | \u00a348 million             |\n| UK Electricity Distribution                        | Full-scope audit                    | \u00a348 million             |\n| US regulated (comprising New York and New England) | Full-scope audit                    | \u00a381 million             |\n| National Grid Ventures UK                          | Audit of specified account balances | \u00a326 million             |\n| Genco (comprising US generating assets)            | Audit of specified account balances | \u00a326 million             |\n| UK Property                                        | Audit of specified account balances | \u00a326 million             |\n\nIn addition to the work performed at a component level, the Group audit team performed audit procedures on the Parent Company financial statements, including but not limited to corporate activities such as treasury as well as on the consolidated financial statements themselves, including entity-level controls, litigation provisions, the consolidation, financial statement disclosures and risk assessment work on components not included elsewhere in the scope of our audit. The Group audit team also performed analytical reviews on out-of-scope components, led the work in connection with the impact of climate change on the useful lives of the Group's gas assets and co-ordinated certain procedures performed on key areas, such as the WPD purchase price allocation and goodwill impairment and environmental provisions, where audit work is performed by both the Group and component audit teams.\n\nThe scope and risk assessment of our audit is broadly consistent with the prior year and our audit coverage of 'Revenue', 'Profit before tax' and 'Net/uni00A0assets' is materially the same as in the prior year.",

Our consideration of the control environment\n\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management's relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in-scope financial statement line items. We tested controls through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\n\nIn limited circumstances where controls were deficient and there were not sufficient mitigating or alternative controls we could rely on, we adopted a/uni00A0non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant were communicated to the Audit & Risk Committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified, we considered the impact and updated our audit plan/uni00A0accordingly.\n\nThe Group's financial systems environment relies on a high number of UK and US applications. In the current year, we scoped 44 IT systems as relevant to the audit. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity's financial reporting process.\n\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls (GITCs) associated with these systems, where the GITCs were appropriately designed and implemented, and these were operating effectively. To assess the operating effectiveness of GITCs, our IT audit specialists performed testing on access security, change management, data centre operations and network operations.\n\n## 7.3. Our consideration of climate-related risks\n\nClimate change impacts National Grid's business in a number of ways as set out in the Strategic Report on page 30 of the Annual Report and note 1 to/uni00A0the financial statements on page 154. It represents a key strategic consideration of management.\n\nWe reviewed management's climate change risk assessment and evaluated the completeness of identified risks and the impact on the financial statements. We also considered the impact of climate change in our own risk assessment procedures. Management's assessment included an overview of the legislative changes in the US, key developments post COP26 and an evaluation of the possible future use of National Grid's US gas assets in a net zero carbon energy system. Both management's and our risk assessment identified the useful economic lives of the gas assets in the US, as the key risk as described in note 13 to the financial statements and in the Audit & Risk Committee Report (page 102). Our response to this risk is documented in our Key Audit Matter on pages 139 - 140.\n\nIn addition to the procedures in respect of the Key Audit Matter mentioned above, with the involvement of our climate change specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7  read the climate-related statements made by management (as disclosed in 'The Environment' section of the 'Our commitment to being a/uni00A0responsible business' in the Strategic Report) and considered whether these were in line with our understanding of management's approach to climate change and the narrative reporting was in line with financial statements and the knowledge obtained throughout the audit; and\n- \u00b7  read the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and considered if any of the information disclosed was inconsistent with the information we obtained through our audit.\n\n## 7.4. Working with other auditors\n\nThe Group audit team is responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process and provide direct oversight, review and coordination of our component audit teams.\n\nAs each of the financially significant components maintains separate financial records, we have engaged component auditors from the Deloitte member firms in the US or the UK to perform procedures at these components on our behalf. This approach allows us to engage local auditors who have appropriate knowledge of local regulations to perform this audit work. We issued detailed instructions to the component auditors and directed and supervised their work.\n\nWe interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and the results of their procedures.\n\nOur oversight of component auditors focused on the planning of their audit work and key judgements made. In particular, our supervision and direction focused on the work performed in relation to key estimates and judgements made by management. As part of our monitoring of component auditors, we participated in key local audit meetings.\n\nThe senior statutory auditor and other Group audit partners conducted visits to meet in person with the component teams responsible for the full-scope locations, which was supplemented by procedures performed remotely throughout the year. Their involvement included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit working papers on higher and significant risk areas to drive a consistent and high quality audit. The level of involvement of the lead audit partner and the Group audit team in the component audits has been extensive and we are satisfied that it has enabled us to conclude that sufficient appropriate audit evidence has been obtained in support of our opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.",

Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\n## 9. Responsibilities of Directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in/uni00A0this regard.",

        "page_content": "## 11.  Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\n## 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations, we/uni00A0considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7  the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key/uni00A0drivers for Directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n- \u00b7  the Group's own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was approved by the Audit & Risk Committee on 22 March 2022;\n- \u00b7  results of our enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Audit & Risk Committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of/uni00A0irregularities;\n- \u00b7  any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group's documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:\n- - identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n- - detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- - responding to the allegations of fraud and bribery against former National Grid employees in the US business (as set out in the Audit & Risk Committee report on page 101); and\n- - the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations; and\n- \u00b7  the matters discussed among the engagement team and our specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as National Grid operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. Fraud specialists also advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nIn common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override of/uni00A0controls.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act 2006, Listing Rules, pensions legislation, tax legislation, the UK Corporate Governance Code, IFRS as issued by the IASB, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards, FRS 101, as well as the US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC regulations, and laws and regulations prevailing in each country which we identified a full-scope component.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the Group's operating licences and environmental regulations.\n\n## 11.2. Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and/uni00A0regulations.\n\nOur procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7  reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7  inquiring of management, the Audit & Risk Committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7  obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7  reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with relevant regulatory authorities; and\n- \u00b7  reviewing the outcome of the alleged fraud and bribery investigations as well as testing the design of the entity-level controls, particularly in respect of the whistleblowing process.\n\nIn addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7  making enquiries of individuals involved in the financial reporting process about inappropriate or unusual activity relating to the processing of journal entries and other adjustments;\n- \u00b7  using our data analytics tools, we selected and tested journal entries and other adjustments which were either made at the end of a reporting period or which identified activity that exhibited certain characteristics of audit interest;\n- \u00b7  assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias;\n- \u00b7  performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and\n- \u00b7  considering whether there were any significant transactions that are outside the normal course of business, or that otherwise appear to be unusual due to their nature, timing or size.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams. We remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.",

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the/uni00A0audit:\n\n- \u00b7  the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7  the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of/uni00A0the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Directors' Report.\n\n## 13. Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the Directors' statement in relation to/uni00A0going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7  the Directors' statement with regard to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 153;\n- \u00b7  the Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 33 - 35;\n- \u00b7  the Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on pages 101 and 134;\n- \u00b7  the Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on pages 28 - 32 and 94;\n- \u00b7  the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 28 - 32; and\n- \u00b7  the section describing the work of the Audit & Risk Committee set out on pages 101 - 105.\n\n## 14.  Matters on which we are required to report by/uni00A0exception\n\n## 14.1 Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7  the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\n## 14.2 Directors' remuneration\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors' remuneration have not/uni00A0been made or the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and/uni00A0returns.\n\nWe have nothing to/uni00A0report in respect of these matters.\n\nWe have nothing to/uni00A0report in respect of these matters.\n\n## 15. Other matters which we are required to address\n\n## 15.1 Auditor tenure\n\nWe became independent and commenced our audit transition on 1 January 2017. Following the recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee, we were appointed by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 31 July 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2018 and subsequent financial periods.\n\nThe period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is five years, covering the years ending 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2022.\n\n## 15.2  Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to/uni00A0the Audit & Risk Committee\n\nOur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit & Risk Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs/uni00A0(UK).\n\n## 16. Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the UK FCA in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard ('ESEF RTS').

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments\n\nAccounting policies describe our approach to recognising and measuring transactions and balances in the year. The accounting policies applicable across the financial statements are shown below, whereas accounting policies that are specific to a component of the financial statements have been incorporated into the relevant note.\n\nThis section also shows areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty in these financial statements. In addition, we have summarised new International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and UK endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations and whether these are effective for this year end or in later years, explaining how significant changes are expected to affect our reported results.\n\nNational Grid's principal activities involve the transmission and distribution of electricity in Great Britain and electricity and gas in northeastern US. The Company is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, with its registered office at 1-3 Strand, London WC2N 5EH.\n\nThe Company, National Grid plc, which is the ultimate parent of the Group, has its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is also quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board on 18 May 2022.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards (IAS) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related interpretations as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the UK. They are prepared on the basis of all IFRS accounting standards and interpretations that are mandatory for the period ended 31 March 2022 and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The comparative financial information has also been prepared on this basis.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the recording of pension assets and liabilities, the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and certain commodity contracts and certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is also the functional currency of the Company.\n\nThe notes to the financial statements have been prepared on a continuing basis unless otherwise stated.\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify financial results before and after exceptional items and remeasurements. We continue to use a columnar presentation as we consider it improves the clarity of the presentation, is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee, and assists users of the financial statements to understand the results. The inclusion of total profit for the period from continuing operations before exceptional items and remeasurements is used to derive part of the incentive target set annually for remunerating certain Executive Directors and accordingly we believe it is important for users of the financial statements to understand how this compares with our results on a statutory basis and period on period.\n\n## A. Going concern\n\nAs part of the Directors' consideration of the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements, the Directors have considered the impact of the planned disposals of The Narragansett Electric Company (NECO) and the UK Gas Transmission business (see note 10) and the financing for the acquisition of PPL Western Power Distribution (WPD) (see note 33). The Directors have assessed the principal risks discussed on pages 28 - 32, including by modelling both a base case and a reasonable worst-case scenario.\n\nThe main cash flow impacts identified in the reasonable worst-case scenario are:\n\n- \u00b7 additional potential working capital requirements in response to energy price increases driven by the wider energy market stability challenges and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n- \u00b7 adverse impacts of inflation on our capex programme;\n- \u00b7 adverse impact from timing across the Group, i.e. a net under-recovery of allowed revenues or reductions in over-collections;\n- \u00b7 a significant reduction in cash collections driven by lower customer demand and increased bad debt in our US businesses and potential supplier defaults in our UK business;\n- \u00b7 higher cash outflow than expected following the Sellindge Interconnector fire;\n- \u00b7 higher operating costs than expected; or non-delivery of planned efficiencies across the Group; and\n- \u00b7 the potential impact of further significant storm costs in the US.\n\nAs part of their analysis, the Board also considered the following potential levers at their discretion to improve the position identified by the analysis if the debt capital markets are not accessible:\n\n- \u00b7 the payment of dividends to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 significant changes in the phasing of the Group's capital programme, with elements of non-essential works and programmes delayed; and\n- \u00b7 a number of further reductions in operating expenditure across the Group primarily related to workforce cost reductions in both the UK and the US.\n\nHaving considered the reasonable worst-case scenario, the impact and timing of the planned strategic transactions, and the further levers at the Board's discretion, the Group continues to have headroom against the Group's committed facilities identified in note 33 to the financial statements.\n\nIn addition to the above, the ability to raise new and extend existing financing was separately included in the analysis, and the Directors noted the c.\u00a34.2 billion of new long-term senior debt issued in the period from 1 April to 31 March 2022 as evidence of the Group's ability to continue to have access to the debt capital markets if needed.\n\nBased on the above, the Directors have concluded the Group is well placed to manage its financing and other business risks satisfactorily and have a reasonable expectation that the Group will have adequate resources to continue in operation for at least 12 months from the signing date of these consolidated financial statements. They therefore consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments continued\n\n## B. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with a share of the results, assets and liabilities of joint operations.\n\nA subsidiary is defined as an entity controlled by the Group. Control is achieved where the Group is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group accounts for joint ventures and associates using the equity method of accounting, where the investment is carried at cost plus postacquisition changes in the share of net assets of the joint venture or associate, less any provision for impairment. Losses in excess of the consolidated interest in joint ventures and associates are not recognised, except where the Company or its subsidiaries have made a commitment to make good those losses.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies used in the individual financial statements of the Company, subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates into line with those used by the Group in its consolidated financial statements under IFRS. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures and associates acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.\n\nAcquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a fair value basis and the remainder recognised as goodwill.\n\n## C. Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or subsidiary concerned are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at closing exchange rates. Non-monetary assets are not retranslated unless they are carried at fair value.\n\nGains and losses arising on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the income statement, except where the application of hedge accounting requires inclusion in other comprehensive income (see note 32(e)).\n\nOn consolidation, the assets and liabilities of operations that have a functional currency different from the Company's functional currency of pounds sterling, principally our US operations that have a functional currency of US dollars, are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period where these do not differ materially from rates at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated translation reserve within other equity reserves (see note 28).\n\n## D. Disposal of The Narragansett Electric Company\n\nAs described further in note 10, on 17 March 2021, the Group signed an agreement to sell 100% of the share capital of a wholly owned subsidiary, NECO. Whilst all of the regulatory approvals are in place, the disposal of NECO was not finalised as at 31 March 2022 due to the appeal of one of these approvals by the Rhode Island Attorney General.\n\nThe associated assets and liabilities have been presented as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position. As NECO does not represent either a major line of business or a geographical area of operations, it has not met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation and therefore its results for the period are not separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.\n\n## E. Disposal of UK Gas Transmission\n\nAs described further in note 10, on 27 March 2022, the Group agreed to sell 100% of the UK Gas Transmission business to a new entity (the 'Acquiring Entity') in exchange for \u00a34.2 billion cash consideration (subject to customary completion adjustments) and a 40% interest in the Acquiring Entity. The sale is expected to complete in the third quarter of the financial year ending 31 March 2023 subject to the receipt of all regulatory approvals. The Group's 40% interest in the Acquiring Entity is expected to be classified as an associate on the basis that the Group will retain significant influence over the business through its retained stake. The Group has the ability to appoint two out of the seven Directors to the Board of the Acquiring Entity. On 27 March 2022, the Group also entered into a Further Acquisition Agreement (FAA) for the potential sale of the remaining 40% stake. The FAA is a put option that can be exercised by the purchaser either in the period between 1 January and 31 March 2023 or in the period between 1 April and 30 June 2023. The deferral of the option window is at our discretion (subject to change depending on the timing of the closing of the sale agreement).\n\nThe Group classified the business as held for sale at the end of August 2021, when it became highly probable that the value of the business to the Group would be recovered through sale rather than continued ownership. As UK Gas Transmission represents a major separate line of business, the business has been classified separately as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income. Earnings per share (EPS) has also been shown split between continuing and discontinued operations.\n\n## F. Areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Information about such judgements and estimations is in the notes to the financial statements, and the key areas are summarised below.\n\nAreas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 categorisation of certain items as exceptional items or remeasurements and the definition of adjusted earnings (see notes 5 and 8). In applying the Group's exceptional items framework, we have considered a number of key matters, as detailed in note 5;\n- \u00b7 in relation to the planned disposal of the UK Gas Transmission business, the key judgement that has been applied is the date from which the business qualified for classification as held for sale and a discontinued operation, as explained further in note 10;\n- \u00b7 in performing the WPD goodwill and indefinite-lived licence intangible assets impairment assessment, judgement has been applied over the forecast cash flow duration (see note 11); and\n- \u00b7 the judgement that, notwithstanding legislation enacted and targets committing the UK, New York State and Massachusetts to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, these do not trigger a reassessment of the remaining useful economic lives of our gas network assets (see key sources of estimation uncertainty below and note 13).\n\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 in performing the goodwill impairment assessment of the WPD group of cash-generating units, the key source of estimation uncertainty relates to the discount rate and terminal value assumptions used in the value-inuse calculations (see note 11);\n- \u00b7 the valuation of liabilities for pensions and other post-retirement benefits (see note 25); and\n- \u00b7 the cash flows applied in determining the environmental provisions, in particular relating to three US Superfund sites (see note 26).",

        "page_content": "## 1. Basis of preparation and recent accounting developments continued\n\nIn addition, we also highlight the estimates made regarding the useful economic lives of our gas network assets due to the length over which they are being depreciated, the potential for new and evolving technologies over that period, and the range of potential pathways for meeting net zero targets (see note 13 for details and sensitivity analysis).\n\nIn order to illustrate the impact that changes in assumptions for the valuation of pension assets and liabilities and cash flows for environmental provisions could have on our results and financial position, we have included sensitivity analyses in note 35. In performing our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived licence intangible assets, we have sensitised our forecasts to factor in adjustments to key inputs to each model (see note 11). Information on what we believe to be a reasonably possible range of outcomes on the recoverability of customer receivables is included in note 19.\n\n## G. Accounting policy choices\n\nIFRS provides certain options available within accounting standards. Choices we have made, and continue to make, include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Presentational formats: we use the nature of expense method for our income statement and aggregate our statement of financial position to net assets and total equity. In the income statement, we present subtotals of total operating profit, profit before tax and profit after tax from continuing operations, together with additional subtotals excluding exceptional items and remeasurements as a result of the three columnar presentation described earlier. Exceptional items and remeasurements are presented in a separate column on the face of the income statement.\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments: we normally opt to apply hedge accounting in most circumstances where this is permitted (see note 32(e)).\n\n## H. New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations effective for the year ended 31 March 2022\n\nWith effect from the period commencing 1 April 2021, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS and IFRS and related interpretations as adopted by the UK, instead of those adopted by the EU. As both sets of accounting standards are currently aligned, there will be no transitional adjustments required and comparative amounts were not required to be restated.\n\nThe Group early adopted the following amendments to standards which have had no material impact on the Group's results or financial statement disclosures:\n\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 16 'Leases - COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 3 'Definition of a Business'; and\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 'Definition of Material'.\n\nIn April 2021, the IFRS IC (Interpretation Committee) also issued an agenda decision in relation to the accounting treatment for configuration and customisation costs in a cloud computing arrangement. This guidance clarified that in order for an intangible asset to be capitalised in relation to customisation and configuration costs in a cloud computing arrangement, it is necessary for there to be control of the underlying software asset or for there to be a separate intangible asset which meets the definition in IAS 38 Intangible Assets. As at 31 March 2022, the Group has recognised a cumulative adjustment against software intangible assets of \u00a334 million for previously capitalised customisation and configuration relating to its continuing operations. The Group has also considered the application of the new accounting guidance for its comparative periods and concluded that it does not have a material impact. Accordingly, no comparative periods have been restated.\n\n## I. New IFRS accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted\n\nThe following new accounting standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued but are not yet effective or have not yet been endorsed by the UK:\n\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements';\n- \u00b7 amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors';\n- \u00b7 annual improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020; and\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 - making materiality judgements.\n\nEffective dates will be subject to the UK endorsement process.\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the impact of the above standards, but they are not expected to have a material impact.\n\nThe Group has not adopted any other standard, amendment or interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective.",

Segmental analysis\n\nThis note sets out the financial performance for the year split into the different parts of the business (operating segments). The performance of these operating segments is monitored and managed on a day-to-day basis. Revenue and the results of the business are analysed by operating segment, based on the information the Board of Directors uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of each operating segment and determining resource allocation between them. The Board is National Grid's chief operating decision maker (as defined by IFRS 8 'Operating Segments') and assesses the profitability of operations principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements (see note 5). As a matter of course, the Board also considers profitability by segment, excluding the effect of timing. However, the measure of profit disclosed in this note is operating profit before exceptional items and remeasurements as this is the measure that is most consistent with the IFRS results reported within these financial statements.\n\nAs a result of the new operating model, the operating segments that were reported up to the Board have changed during the period to align with the six business units that will continue to operate, and the UK Gas Transmission business that is expected to be disposed of, which is now considered a discontinued operation (see note 10). Five of these continuing businesses meet the size criteria set out in the accounting standards to be treated as reportable operating segments. The other operating segment, remaining businesses that are not operating segments and the corporate centre activities are reported to the Board of Directors on an aggregated basis.\n\nThe following table describes the main activities for each reportable operating segment within continuing operations:\n\n| UK Electricity Transmission    | The high-voltage electricity transmission networks in England and Wales.                                                         |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UK Electricity Distribution    | The electricity distribution networks of WPD in the East Midlands, West Midlands and South West of England and  South Wales.     |\n| UK Electricity System Operator | The Great Britain system operator.                                                                                               |\n| New England                    | Gas distribution networks, electricity distribution networks and high-voltage electricity transmission networks  in New England. |\n| New York                       | Gas distribution networks, electricity distribution networks and high-voltage electricity transmission networks in New York.     |\n\nThe UK Gas Transmission business, which owns the high-pressure gas transmission networks in Great Britain and gas system operator in Great Britain and includes the regulated gas metering operations (which was previously reported within NGV and Other), is now a discontinued operation and classified as held for sale (see note 10). Therefore, while it is still a reportable operating segment, it is no longer presented within continuing operations.\n\nThe National Grid Ventures (NGV) operating segment is outside our regulated core business and operates in competitive markets across the UK and the US. The business comprises all commercial operations in LNG at the Isle of Grain in the UK, our electricity generation business in the US, our electricity interconnectors and our investment in National Grid Renewables Development LLC, with a focus on investment and future activities in emerging growth areas. NGV does not meet the thresholds set out in IFRS 8 to be identified as a separate reportable segment and therefore its results are not required to be separately presented.\n\nOther activities that do not form part of any of the segments in the above table or NGV primarily relate to our UK property business together with insurance and corporate activities in the UK and US and the Group's investments in technology and innovation companies through National Grid Partners.\n\n## (a) Revenue\n\nRevenue primarily represents the sales value derived from the generation, transmission and distribution of energy, together with the sales value derived from the provision of other services to customers. Refer to note 3 for further details.\n\nSales between operating segments are priced considering the regulatory and legal requirements to which the businesses are subject. The analysis of revenue by geographical area is on the basis of destination. There are no material sales between the UK and US geographical areas.\n\n|                                                            | 2022            | 2022                      | 2022                      | 2021\u00b9           | 2021\u00b9                      | 2021\u00b9                       | 2020\u00b9           | 2020\u00b9                     | 2020\u00b9                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                            | Total  sales \u00a3m | Sales between segments \u00a3m | Sales to third parties \u00a3m | Total  sales \u00a3m | Sales  between segments \u00a3m | Sales  to third  parties \u00a3m | Total  sales \u00a3m | Sales between segments \u00a3m | Sales  to third  parties \u00a3m |\n| Operating segments -

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 3. Revenue\n\nRevenue arises in the course of ordinary activities and principally comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 transmission services;\n- \u00b7 distribution services; and\n- \u00b7 generation services.\n\nTransmission services, distribution services and certain other services (excluding rental income but including metering) fall within the scope of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', whereas generation services (which solely relate to the contract with the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) in the US) are accounted for under IFRS 16 'Leases' as rental income, also presented within revenue. Revenue is recognised to reflect the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties and value added tax. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control over a product or service to a customer.\n\nRevenue in respect of regulated activities is determined by regulatory agreements that set the price to be charged for services in a given period based on pre-determined allowed revenues. Variances in service usage can result in actual revenue collected exceeding (over-recoveries) or falling short (under-recoveries) of allowed revenues. Where regulatory agreements allow the recovery of under-recoveries or require the return of over-recoveries, the allowed revenue for future periods is typically adjusted. In these instances, no assets or liabilities are recognised for under- or over-recoveries respectively, because the adjustment relates to future services that have not yet been delivered.\n\nBelow, we include a description of principal activities, by reportable segment, from which the Group generates its revenue. For more detailed information about our segments, see note 2.\n\n## (a) UK Electricity Transmission\n\nThe UK Electricity Transmission segment principally generates revenue by providing electricity transmission services in England and Wales. Our business operates as a monopoly regulated by Ofgem, which has established price control mechanisms that set the amount of annual allowed returns our business can earn (along with the Scottish and Offshore transmission operators amongst others).\n\nThe transmission of electricity encompasses the following principal services:\n\n- \u00b7 the supply of high-voltage electricity - revenue is recognised based on usage. Our performance obligation is satisfied over time as our customers make use of our network. We bill monthly in arrears and our payment terms are up to 60 days. Price is determined prior to our financial year end with reference to the regulated allowed returns and estimated annual volumes; and\n- \u00b7 construction work (principally for connections) - revenue is recognised over time, as we provide access to our network. Customers can either pay over the useful life of the connection or upfront. Where the customer pays upfront, revenues are deferred as a contract liability and released over the life of the asset.\n\nFor other construction where there is no consideration for any future services, for example diversions, revenues are recognised as the construction work is completed.\n\n## (b) UK Electricity Distribution\n\nThe UK Electricity Distribution segment principally generates revenue by providing electricity distribution services in the Midlands and South West of England and South Wales. Similar to UK Electricity Transmission, UK Electricity Distribution operates as a monopoly in the jurisdictions that it operates in and is regulated by Ofgem.\n\nThe distribution of electricity encompasses the following principal services:\n\n- \u00b7 electricity distribution - revenue is recognised based on usage by customers (over time), based upon volumes and price. The price control mechanism in place that determines our annual allowances is similar to UK Electricity Transmission. Revenues are billed monthly and payment terms are typically within 14 days; and\n- \u00b7 construction work (principally for connections) - revenue is recognised over time as we provide access to our network. Where the customer pays upfront, revenues are deferred as a contract liability and released over the life of the asset.\n\nFor other construction where there is no consideration for any future services, revenues are recognised as the construction is completed.\n\n## (c) UK Electricity System Operator\n\nThe UK System Operator earns revenue for balancing supply and demand of electricity on Great Britain's electricity transmission system, where it acts as principal. Balancing services are regulated by Ofgem and revenue is recognised as the service is provided.\n\nThe System Operator also collects revenues on behalf of transmission operators, principally National Grid Electricity Transmission plc and the Scottish and Offshore transmission operators, from users (electricity suppliers) who connect to or use the transmission system. As the System Operator acts as an agent in this capacity, it therefore records transmission network revenues net of payments to transmission operators.\n\n## (d) New England\n\nThe New England segment principally generates revenue by providing electricity and gas distribution services and high voltage electricity transmission services in New England. Distribution services are regulated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (MADPU) and the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) and transmission services are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), both of whom regulate the rates that can be charged to customers.\n\nThe distribution of electricity and gas and the provision of electricity transmission facilities encompasses the following principal services:\n\n- \u00b7 electricity and gas distribution and electricity transmission - revenue is recognised based on usage by customers (over time). Revenues are billed monthly and payment terms are 30 days; and\n- \u00b7 construction work (principally for connections) - revenue is recognised over time as we provide access to our network. Where the customer pays upfront, revenues are deferred as a contract liability or customer contributions (where they relate to government entities) and released over the life of the connection.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Revenue continued\n\n## (e) New York\n\nThe New York segment principally generates revenue by providing electricity and gas distribution services and high-voltage electricity transmission services in New York. Distribution services are regulated by the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) and transmission services are regulated by the FERC, both of whom regulate the rates that can be charged to customers.\n\nThe distribution of electricity and gas and the provision of electricity transmission facilities encompasses the following principal services:\n\n- \u00b7 electricity and gas distribution and electricity transmission - revenue is recognised based on usage by customers (over time). Revenues are billed monthly and payment terms are 30 days; and\n- \u00b7 construction work (principally for connections) - revenue is recognised over time as we provide access to our network. Where the customer pays upfront, revenues are deferred as a contract liability or customer contributions (where they relate to government entities) and released over the life of the connection.\n\n## (f) NGV and Other\n\nNGV and Other generates revenue from electricity interconnectors, LNG at the Isle of Grain, National Grid Renewables, our UK commercial property business, rental income and insurance.\n\nThe Group recognises revenue from transmission services through interconnectors and LNG importation at the Isle of Grain by means of customers' use of capacity and volumes. Revenue is recognised over time and is billed monthly. Payment terms are up to 30 days. Revenues in respect of certain wholly owned interconnector subsidiaries are subject to a cap and floor regime constructed by Ofgem. Where an interconnector expects to breach its total fiveyear cap, a provision and reduction in revenue is recognised in the current reporting period (see note 26). Where an interconnector does not expect to reach its five-year floor, either an asset will be recognised where a future inflow of economic benefits is considered virtually certain, or a contingent asset will be disclosed where the future inflow is concluded to be probable.\n\nElectricity generation revenue is earned from the provision of energy services and supply capacity to produce energy for the use of customers of LIPA through a power supply agreement where LIPA receives all of the energy and capacity from the asset until at least 2025. The arrangement is treated as an operating lease within the scope of the leasing standard where we act as lessor; with rental income being recorded as other income, which forms part of total revenue. Lease payments (capacity payments) are recognised on a straight-line basis and variable lease payments are recognised as the energy is generated.\n\nOther revenue in the scope of IFRS 15 principally includes sales of renewables projects from National Grid Renewables to Emerald Energy Venture LLC (Emerald), which is jointly controlled by National Grid and Washington State Investment Board (WSIB) (see note 16). National Grid Renewables develops wind and solar generation assets in the US, whilst Emerald has a right of first refusal to buy, build and operate those assets. Revenue is recognised as it is earned.\n\nOther revenue, recognised in accordance with standards other than IFRS 15, includes property sales by our UK commercial property business (including sales to our 50% share in the St William joint venture which was sold on 15 March 2022) and rental income. Property sales are recorded at a point in time (when the sale is legally completed) and rental income is recorded over time.\n\n## (g) Disaggregation of revenue\n\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market and major service lines.

Contract liabilities in the years ended 31 March 2021 and 2020 included amounts in respect of the UK Gas Transmission business of \u00a3136 million and \u00a3136 million respectively. Revenue is recognised over the life of the asset. The asset lives for connections in UK Electricity Transmission, UK Electricity Distribution, New England and New York are 40 years, 69 years, 51 years and up to 48 years respectively. The weighted average amortisation period is 31 years.\n\nFuture revenues in relation to unfulfilled performance obligations not yet received in cash amount to \u00a35.2 billion (2021: \u00a34.8 billion; 2020: \u00a33.1 billion). \u00a31.7 billion (2021: \u00a31.6 billion; 2020: \u00a31.5 billion) relates to connection contracts in UK Electricity Transmission which will be recognised as revenue over 25 years and \u00a33.0 billion (2021: \u00a33.0 billion; 2020: \u00a31.5 billion) relates to revenues to be earned under Grain LNG contracts until 2045. The remaining amount will be recognised as revenue over 3 years.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised for the year ended 31 March 2022 from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to changes in the estimate of the stage of completion, is \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil; 2020: \u00a3nil).",

Exceptional items and remeasurements\n\nTo monitor our financial performance, we use a profit measure that excludes certain income and expenses. We call that measure 'adjusted profit'. Adjusted profit (which excludes exceptional items and remeasurements as defined below) is used by management to monitor financial performance as it is considered that it aids the comparability of our reported financial performance from year to year. We exclude items from adjusted profit because, if included, these items could distort understanding of our performance for the year and the comparability between periods. This note analyses these items, which are included in our results for the year but are excluded from adjusted profit.\n\n## Exceptional items and remeasurements from continuing operations\n\n|                                                                                   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 1 \u00a3m   | 2020 1 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Included within operating profit                                                  |           |             |             |\n| Exceptional items:                                                                |           |             |             |\n| Release of St William Homes LLP deferred income                                   | 189       | -           | -           |\n| Net gain on disposal of St William Homes LLP                                      | 228       | -           | -           |\n| New operating model implementation costs and cost efficiency programme            | (66)      | (50)        | -           |\n| Transaction and separation costs                                                  | (223)     | (24)        | -           |\n| Environmental insurance recovery                                                  | 38        | -           | -           |\n| Changes in environmental provisions                                               | -         | 14          | (400)       |\n|                                                                                   | 166       | (60)        | (400)       |\n| Remeasurements - commodity contract derivatives                                   | 392       | 34          | (125)       |\n|                                                                                   | 558       | (26)        | (525)       |\n| Included within finance income and costs                                          |           |             |             |\n| Remeasurements:                                                                   |           |             |             |\n| Net gains/(losses) on financing derivatives                                       | 74        | 47          | (21)        |\n| Net (losses)/gains on financial assets at fair value through profit and loss      | (15)      | 23          | (16)        |\n|                                                                                   | 59        | 70          | (37)        |\n| Included within share of post-tax results of joint ventures and associates        |           |             |             |\n| Remeasurements:                                                                   |           |             |             |\n| Remeasurements - net losses on financial instruments                              | (56)      | (8)         | (1)         |\n| Total included within profit/(loss) before tax                                    | 561       | 36          | (563)       |\n| Included within tax                                                               |           |             |             |\n| Exceptional items - movements arising on items not included in profit before tax: |           |             |             |\n| Deferred tax charge arising as a result of UK tax rate change                     | (458)     | -           | (148)       |\n| Tax on exceptional items                                                          | (28)      | 8           | 103         |\n| Tax on remeasurements                                                             | (103)     | (34)        | 37          |\n|                                                                                   | (589)     | (26)        | (8)         |\n| Total exceptional items and remeasurements after tax                              | (28)      | 10          | (571)       |\n| Analysis of total exceptional items and remeasurements after tax                  |           |             |             |\n| Exceptional items after tax                                                       | (320)     | (52)        | (445)       |\n| Remeasurements after tax                                                          | 292       | 62          | (126)       |\n| Total exceptional items and remeasurements after tax                              | (28)      | 10          | (571)       |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## 5. Exceptional items and remeasurements continued\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nManagement uses an exceptional items framework that has been discussed and approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. This follows a three-step process which considers the nature of the event, the financial materiality involved and any particular facts and circumstances. In considering the nature of the event, management focuses on whether the event is within the Group's control and how frequently such an event typically occurs. With respect to restructuring costs, these represent additional expenses incurred that are not related to the normal business and day-to-day activities. In determining the facts and circumstances, management considers factors such as ensuring consistent treatment between favourable and unfavourable transactions, the precedent for similar items, the number of periods over which costs will be spread or gains earned, and the commercial context for the particular transaction. The exceptional items framework was last updated in March 2022 and reflects the latest disclosure requirements arising in respect of FRC guidance issued in the year.\n\nItems of income or expense that are considered by management for designation as exceptional items include significant restructurings, write-downs or impairments of non-current assets, significant changes in environmental or decommissioning provisions, integration of acquired businesses, gains or losses on disposals of businesses or investments and significant debt redemption costs as a consequence of transactions such as significant disposals or issues of equity, and the related tax, as well as deferred tax arising on changes to corporation tax rates.\n\nCosts arising from restructuring programmes include redundancy costs. Redundancy costs are charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which a commitment is made to incur the costs and the main features of the restructuring plan have been announced to affected employees.\n\nSet out below are details of the transactions against which we have considered the application of our exceptional items framework in each of the years for which results are presented. No COVID-19-related costs incurred have been recognised as exceptional in any of the years presented.\n\n## 2022\n\n## Net gain on disposal of St William Homes LLP and release of deferred income\n\nDuring the year, the Group recognised a gain of \u00a3228 million on the disposal of its entire 50% equity interest in the St William Homes LLP joint venture to The Berkeley Group plc for cash consideration of \u00a3413 million (see note 16). In connection with the disposal, the Group also released deferred income of \u00a3189 million which related to deferred profits from previous property sales to St William Homes LLP. We have concluded that the release of the deferred income should be classified as exceptional given the crystallisation event for the release is the sale of the Group's equity interest in St William Homes LLP.\n\n## New operating model implementation costs and cost efficiency programme\n\nThe Group incurred a further \u00a366 million of costs in relation to the design and implementation of our new operating model and the major cost efficiency programme announced in November 2021. The costs recognised primarily relate to professional fees incurred and redundancy provisions. Whilst the costs incurred this year do not meet the quantitative threshold to be classified as exceptional on a standalone basis, when taken in aggregate with the costs expected to be incurred over the duration of the programme, we have concluded that the costs should be classified as exceptional in line with our exceptional items policy. Estimated costs expected to be incurred in future years are disclosed in the Financial review on page 38. The total cash outflow for the period was \u00a348 million.\n\n## Transaction and separation costs\n\n\u00a3223 million of transaction and separation costs were incurred in the period in relation to the acquisition of WPD (see note 37), the planned disposal of NECO (see note 10) and the planned disposal of our UK Gas Transmission business (see note 10). The costs relate to legal fees, bankers' fees and other professional fees. The costs have been classified as exceptional, consistent with similar costs for the year ended 31 March 2021. The total cash outflow for the year was \u00a3196 million.\n\n## Environmental insurance recovery\n\nIn the US, the most significant component of our \u00a31.9 billion environmental provision relates to several Superfund sites, and arose from former manufacturing gas plant facilities, previously owned or operated by the Group or its predecessor companies. Under Federal and State Superfund laws, potential liability for the historical contamination may be imposed on responsible parties jointly and severally, without regard to fault, even if the activities were lawful when they occurred. In the year, we have recognised an exceptional gain of \u00a338 million relating to an insurance receivable for site remediation costs that are included in our Superfund sites environmental provision. The insurance receipts have been recorded as an exceptional item in line with the treatment of the related costs.\n\n## 2021\n\n## New operating model implementation costs\n\nThe Group incurred \u00a350 million of costs in relation to the design and implementation of our new operating model that is built on a foundation of six business units. The costs recognised in the year ended 31 March 2021 primarily related to professional fees incurred and redundancy provisions. In evaluating the costs incurred against the quantitative thresholds in our exceptional items framework we considered the total costs to be incurred over the duration of the programme. Whilst the costs incurred did not meet the quantitative threshold to be classified as exceptional on a standalone basis, we concluded that the costs should be classified as exceptional in line with our exceptional items policy, in order to ensure that the costs are treated in a consistent manner with similar costs incurred previously. The total cash outflow for the year was \u00a333 million.\n\n## Transaction and separation costs\n\n\u00a324 million of transaction and separation costs were incurred in relation to the acquisition of WPD (see note 37) and the planned sale of NECO (see note 10). The costs related to legal fees, bankers' fees and professional fees. Whilst the costs incurred in isolation were not sufficiently material to warrant classification as an exceptional item, we expected further costs to be incurred in the next year, for example, in regard to success fees on completion of the acquisition. When taken in aggregate, the costs incurred over both years will be sufficiently material to be classified as exceptional in line with our policy. The total cash outflow for the year was \u00a314 million.\n\n## Changes in environmental provision\n\nWe recognised an exceptional gain of \u00a314 million relating to the release of environmental provisions relating to one of our US Superfund sites, for which the original provision was treated as an exceptional item. The reduction in the provision arose as a result of the re-evaluation of the Group's share of estimated costs following the finalisation of discussions on the scope of certain remediation work with government authorities. The release was recorded as an exceptional item in line with the treatment of the original provision.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 5. Exceptional items and remeasurements continued\n\n## 2020\n\nChanges in environmental provisions\n\nAs a result of notices issued by governmental authorities and newly developed cost estimates prepared by third-party engineers in relation to our US Superfund sites, we re-evaluated our estimates of total costs and cost sharing allocations borne by the Company, and accordingly increased our provision by \u00a3326 million. Under the terms of our rate plans, we are entitled to recovery of environmental clean -up costs from rate payers, but under IFRS no asset can be recognised for this recovery.\n\nAlso included in the total environmental charge was the \u00a374 million (re-presented to reflect the classification of the UK Gas Transmission business as a discontinued operation) impact of the change in the real discount rate applied to the environmental provisions across the Group, of which \u00a366 million related to the US and \u00a38 million to the UK. Given the substantial and sustained change in gilts and corporate bond yields, we concluded it was appropriate to reduce the real discount rate from 1% to 0.5%. The weighted average remaining duration of our cash flows is now around 10 years.\n\n## Remeasurements\n\nRemeasurements comprise unrealised gains or losses recorded in the consolidated income statement arising from changes in the fair value of certain of our financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL). Once the fair value movements are realised (for example, when the derivative matures), the previously recognised fair value movements are then reversed through remeasurements and recognised within earnings before exceptional items and remeasurements. These assets and liabilities include commodity contract derivatives and financing derivatives to the extent that hedge accounting is not available or is not fully effective.\n\nThe unrealised gains or losses reported in profit and loss on certain additional assets and liabilities treated at FVTPL are also classified within remeasurements. These relate to financial assets (which fail the 'solely payments of principal and interest test' under IFRS 9), the money market fund investments used by Group Treasury for cash management purposes and the net foreign exchange gains and losses on borrowing activities. These are offset by foreign exchange gains and losses on financing derivatives measured at fair value. In all cases, these fair values increase or decrease because of changes in foreign exchange, commodity or other financial indices over which we have no control.\n\nWe report unrealised gains or losses relating to certain discrete classes of financial assets accounted for at FVTPL within adjusted profit. These comprise our portfolio of investments made by National Grid Partners, our investment in Sunrun Neptune 2016 LLC and the contingent consideration arising on the acquisition of National Grid Renewables (all within NGV and Other). The performance of these assets (including changes in fair value) is included in our assessment of adjusted profit for the relevant business units.\n\nRemeasurements excluded from adjusted profit are made up of the following categories:\n\n- i. Net gains/(losses) on commodity contract derivatives represent mark-to-market movements on certain physical and financial commodity contract obligations in the US. These contracts primarily relate to the forward purchase of energy for supply to customers, or to the economic hedging thereof, that are required to be measured at fair value and that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Under the existing rate plans in the US, commodity costs are recoverable from customers although the timing of recovery may differ from the pattern of costs incurred;\n- ii. Net gains/(losses) on financing derivatives comprise gains and losses arising on derivative financial instruments used for the risk management of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures. These exclude gains and losses for which hedge accounting has been effective, and have been recognised directly in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income or are offset by adjustments to the carrying value of debt (see notes 17 and 32). Net foreign exchange gains and losses on financing derivatives used for the risk management of foreign exchange exposures are offset by foreign exchange losses and gains on borrowing activities;\n- iii. Net gains/(losses) on financial assets measured at FVTPL comprise gains and losses on the investment funds held by our insurance captives which are categorised as FVTPL (see note 15);\n- iv. Net gains/(losses) on financial liabilities measured at FVTPL comprise the change in the fair value (excluding changes due to own credit risk) of a financial liability that was designated at FVTPL on transition to IFRS 9 to reduce a measurement mismatch (see note 21); and\n- v. Unrealised net gains/(losses) on derivatives and other financial instruments within our joint ventures and associates.\n\n## Items included within tax\n\n## 2022\n\nChange in UK corporation tax rate\n\nIn the Spring Budget 2021, the UK government announced that from 1 April 2023 the UK corporation tax rate will increase to 25%, and this was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021. Deferred tax balances at 31 March 2022 were remeasured at the enacted rate, with \u00a3458 million recognised as exceptional, in line with previous periods.\n\n## 2020\n\nThe Finance Act 2016, which was enacted on 15 September 2016, reduced the main UK corporation tax rate to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. Deferred tax balances were calculated at this rate for the years ended 31 March 2017 to 2019. On 17 March 2020, the UK government utilised the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 to substantively enact a reversal of the reduction in the main UK corporation tax rate to 17% with effect from\n\n1 April 2020, resulting in the rate remaining at 19%. Deferred taxes at 31 March 2020 were measured using enacted tax rates and reflected in these\n\nfinancial statements, resulting in a \u00a3148 million deferred tax charge (re-presented to reflect the classification of the UK Gas Transmission business as\n\na discontinued operation), principally due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities. The treatment of this charge as exceptional was consistent\n\nwith the treatment for the year ended 31 March 2017 when the original reduction in the tax rate was substantively enacted, resulting in the recognition\n\nof an exceptional tax credit of \u00a394 million.",

Finance income and costs\n\nThis note details the interest income generated by our financial assets and interest expense incurred on our financial liabilities, primarily our financing portfolio (including our financing derivatives). It also includes the net interest on our pensions and other post-retirement assets. In reporting adjusted profit, we adjust net financing costs to exclude any net gains or losses on financial instruments included in remeasurements (see note 5).\n\nFinance income and costs remeasurements include unrealised gains and losses on certain assets and liabilities now treated at FVTPL.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 7. Tax\n\nTax is payable in the territories where we operate, mainly the UK and the US. This note gives further details of the total tax charge and tax liabilities, including current and deferred tax. The current tax charge is the tax payable on this year's taxable profits. Deferred tax is an accounting adjustment to provide for tax that is expected to arise in the future due to differences in the accounting and tax bases.\n\nThe tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in the statement of changes in equity, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction. The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amounts expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amounts are those that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nThe Group operates internationally in territories with different and complex tax codes. Management exercises judgement in relation to the level of provision required for uncertain tax outcomes. There are a number of tax positions not yet agreed with the tax authorities where different interpretations of legislation could lead to a range of outcomes. Judgements are made for each position having regard to particular circumstances and advice obtained.\n\nDeferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method, and is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. However, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than a business combination) that affects neither the accounting nor the taxable profit or loss.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority, and the Company and its subsidiaries intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\n## Tax charged/(credited) to the consolidated income statement - continuing operations\n\n|                                                                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 1 \u00a3m   | 2020 1 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Tax before exceptional items and remeasurements                     | 669       | 334         | 362         |\n| Exceptional tax on items not included in profit before tax (note 5) | 458       | -           | 148         |\n| Tax on other exceptional items and remeasurements                   | 131       | 26          | (140)       |\n| Total tax reported within exceptional items and remeasurements      | 589       | 26          | 8           |\n| Total tax charge from continuing operations                         | 1,258     | 360         | 370         |\n\n## Tax as a percentage of profit before tax\n\n|                                                                     |   2022 % |   2021 1 % |   2020 1 % |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|------------|\n| Before exceptional items and remeasurements - continuing operations |     23.2 |       20.5 |       18.4 |\n| After exceptional items and remeasurements - continuing operations  |     36.6 |       21.6 |       26.4 |",

This was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021. Deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2022, that are expected to reverse after 1 April 2023, have been calculated at 25%.\n\nThe US government continues to consider changes to federal tax legislation, but as no changes have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, deferred tax balances as at 31 March 2022 have been calculated at the prevailing tax rates based on the current tax laws.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the developments driven by Brexit, the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project and European Commission initiatives including fiscal aid investigations. At this time, we do not expect this to have any material impact on our future tax charges. Governments across the world including the UK and the US have introduced various stimulus/reliefs for businesses to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, from which we do not currently expect there to be a material impact on our future tax charges.",

The deferred tax balances (after offset) for statement of financial position purposes consist solely of deferred tax liabilities of \u00a36,765 million (2021: \u00a34,815 million). This balance is after offset of a deferred tax asset of \u00a3428 million (2021: \u00a3455 million) which has been recognised in respect of net operating losses (\u00a3418 million) and capital losses (\u00a310 million).\n\nDeferred tax assets in respect of some capital losses as well as trading losses and non-trade deficits have not been recognised as their future recovery is uncertain or not currently anticipated. The total deferred tax assets not recognised are as follows:\n\n|                    | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital losses     | 2,363     | 1,620     |\n| Non-trade deficits | 1         | 1         |\n| Trading losses     | 7         | 7         |\n\nThe capital losses arose in the UK on disposal of certain businesses or assets. They are available to carry forward indefinitely but can only be offset against future capital gains. The UK non-trade deficits arose prior to 1 April 2017 and therefore can only be offset against future non-trade profits.\n\nAt 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, there were no recognised deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Group's subsidiaries or its associates as there are no significant corporation tax consequences of the Group's UK, US or overseas subsidiaries or associates paying dividends to their parent companies. There are also no significant income tax consequences for the Group from the payment of dividends by the Group to its shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 8. Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEPS is the amount of profit after tax attributable to each ordinary share. Basic EPS is calculated on profit after tax for the year attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. Diluted EPS shows what the impact would be if all outstanding share options were exercised and treated as ordinary shares at year end. The weighted average number of shares is increased by additional shares issued as scrip dividends and reduced by shares repurchased by the Company during the year. The earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the Company which excludes non-controlling interests.\n\nAdjusted earnings and EPS, which exclude exceptional items and remeasurements, are provided to reflect the adjusted profit sub-totals used by the Company.

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nThe results and cash flows of significant assets or businesses sold during the year are shown separately from our continuing operations, and presented within discontinued operations in the income statement and cash flow statement. Assets and businesses are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts are recovered through sale rather than through continuing use. They only meet the held for sale condition when the assets are ready for immediate sale in their present condition, management is committed to the sale and it is highly probable that the sale will complete within one year. Depreciation ceases on assets and businesses when they are classified as held for sale and the assets and businesses are impaired if the proceeds less sale costs fall short of the carrying value.\n\n## (a) Assets held for sale\n\nThe following assets and liabilities were classified as held for sale as at 31 March 2022:\n\n|                                   | Total  assets  held for  sale  \u00a3m   | Total  liabilities  held for  sale  \u00a3m   | Net assets  held for  sale  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| The Narragansett Electric Company | 4,129                               | (1,658)                                  | 2,471                            |\n| UK Gas Transmission               | 5,871                               | (5,530)                                  | 341                              |\n| Net assets held for sale          | 10,000                              | (7,188)                                  | 2,812                            |\n\n## The Narragansett Electric Company\n\nOn 17 March 2021, the Group signed an agreement to sell 100% of the share capital of a wholly owned subsidiary, NECO. NECO is part of our New England segment and is a retail distribution company providing electricity and gas to customers in Rhode Island. The associated assets and liabilities were consequently presented as held for sale in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\nAs NECO does not represent a separate major line of business or geographical operations, the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation are not met and accordingly its results have not been separately disclosed on the face of the income statement.\n\nWhilst all of the regulatory approvals are in place, the disposal of NECO was not finalised as at 31 March 2022 due to the appeal of one of these approvals by the Rhode Island Attorney General. The following assets and liabilities of NECO were classified as held for sale at 31 March 2022:\n\n|                                 | \u00a3m      |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Goodwill                        | 590     |\n| Intangible assets               | 4       |\n| Property, plant and equipment   | 3,173   |\n| Trade and other receivables     | 251     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 6       |\n| Other assets                    | 105     |\n| Total assets held for sale      | 4,129   |\n| Borrowings                      | (1,177) |\n| Pension liabilities             | (12)    |\n| Other liabilities               | (469)   |\n| Total liabilities held for sale | (1,658) |\n| Net assets held for sale        | 2,471   |\n\nNo impairment losses were recognised upon remeasurement of the assets and liabilities prior to classification as held for sale. NECO generated profit after tax of \u00a3237 million for the year ended 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a3104 million; 2020: \u00a331 million). Current and deferred tax balances relating to NECO have not been included as held for sale on the basis that those balances will be retained by National Grid rather than transferred with the other assets and liabilities of NECO. Furthermore, the tax balances of NECO have been classified within current and non-current assets and liabilities with the corresponding offsets from the other Group members in accordance with the jurisdictional netting principles.",

Assets held for sale and discontinued operations continued\n\n## (a) Assets held for sale continued\n\n## UK Gas Transmission\n\nThe Group announced its intention to sell the UK Gas Transmission business on 18 March 2021. On 27 March 2022, the Group agreed to sell 100% of the UK Gas Transmission business to a new entity (the 'Acquiring Entity') in exchange for \u00a34.2 billion cash consideration (subject to customary completion adjustments) and a 40% interest in the Acquiring Entity. The other 60% in the Acquiring Entity will be owned by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) and British Columbia Investment Management Corporation (BCI) (together, the 'Consortium'). \u00a32.0 billion of the cash consideration comes from additional debt financing raised by the Acquiring Entity at completion. The sale is expected to complete in the third quarter of the financial year ending 31 March 2023 subject to the receipt of all regulatory approvals.\n\nOn 27 March 2022, the Group also entered into a Further Acquisition Agreement (FAA) with the Consortium. This allows the Consortium to purchase the Group's 40% interest in the Acquiring Entity for \u00a31.4 billion plus an annualised escalation factor. The FAA can be exercised either in the period between 1 January and 31 March 2023 or in the period between 1 April and 30 June 2023. The deferral of the option window is at our discretion (subject to change, depending on the timing of the closing of the sale agreement).\n\nThe Group classified the associated assets and liabilities of the business as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 August 2021, when the sale was considered to be highly probable following management approval of the sale timetable and communication thereof to potential buyers. As at 31 March 2022, the following assets and liabilities of the UK Gas Transmission business were classified as held for sale:\n\n|                                 | \u00a3m      |\n|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Intangible assets               | 159     |\n| Property, plant and equipment   | 4,719   |\n| Trade and other receivables     | 215     |\n| Pension assets                  | 664     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 9       |\n| Financing derivatives           | 93      |\n| Other assets                    | 12      |\n| Total assets held for sale      | 5,871   |\n| Borrowings                      | (4,165) |\n| Deferred tax liabilities        | (803)   |\n| Other liabilities               | (562)   |\n| Total liabilities held for sale | (5,530) |\n| Net assets held for sale        | 341     |\n\nNo impairment losses were recognised upon remeasurement of the assets and liabilities prior to classification as held for sale.\n\n## (b) Discontinued operations\n\n## Planned disposal of UK Gas Transmission\n\nAs UK Gas Transmission represents a major separate line of business, the business has also met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation, and therefore the results of the business have been shown separately from the continuing business for all periods presented on the face of the income statement as a discontinued operation.\n\n## Disposal of Quadgas HoldCo Limited\n\nIn June 2019, the Group sold its remaining 39% interest in Cadent (held through its holding in Quadgas HoldCo Limited (Quadgas)). The aggregate carrying value of our investment in Quadgas at the disposal date was \u00a31,956 million and the total sales proceeds were \u00a31,965 million, resulting in a gain on disposal of \u00a39 million.\n\nWe considered the disposal of our 39% investment in Quadgas as the final stage of the plan to dispose of our interest in the UK Gas Distribution business first announced in 2015, and accordingly treated the results and cash flows arising from Quadgas as a discontinued operation on the basis that the sale formed the final part of a 'single coordinated plan' to dispose of UK Gas Distribution.",

Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of what we paid to acquire businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the acquisition date. We assess whether goodwill is recoverable by performing an impairment review annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing exchange rate. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) and this allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the acquisition in which the goodwill arose.\n\nImpairment is recognised where there is a difference between the carrying value of the CGU and the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU to which that goodwill has been allocated. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. Any impairment loss is first allocated to the carrying value of the goodwill and then to the other assets within the CGU. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and estimated value-in-use at the date the impairment review is undertaken. Value-in-use represents the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\n|                                             | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Net book value at 1 April 2020              | 5,712      |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | (562)      |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (562)      |\n| Net book value at 1 April 2021              | 4,588      |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | 223        |\n| Acquisition of WPD (note 37)                | 4,721      |\n| Net book value at 31 March 2022             | 9,532      |\n\nThere was no significant accumulated impairment charge as at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the planned sale of NECO (see note 10), goodwill balances relating to our Rhode Island CGU and a portion of the goodwill relating to our previously reported Federal CGU were reclassified as held for sale in the prior period. Following the implementation of our new operating model during the year ended 31 March 2022, we have reassessed our CGUs. The Federal CGU (\u00a3544 million) is now allocated across the New York, New England and National Grid Ventures Renewables CGUs. The Massachusetts CGU (\u00a3963 million) is now allocated to the New England CGU. These changes reflect the updated level at which goodwill is now monitored for internal management purposes.\n\n## Impairment review of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles (see note 12) are reviewed annually for impairment and the recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of our operations with the expected recoverable amount on a value-in-use basis which uses pre-financing and pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group's financial plans, approved by the Directors, as a starting point. See below for a summary of which operations our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are allocated to:\n\n| CGU or group of CGUs                                               | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Goodwill:                                                          |           |\n| National Grid Ventures Renewables                                  | 150       |\n| New England                                                        | 1,510     |\n| New York                                                           | 3,151     |\n| WPD 1                                                              | 4,721     |\n| Total goodwill                                                     | 9,532     |\n| Indefinite-lived intangibles (regulatory licences related to WPD): |           |\n| West Midlands                                                      | 518       |\n| East Midlands                                                      | 519       |\n| South Wales                                                        | 257       |\n| South West                                                         | 420       |\n| Total indefinite-lived intangibles                                 | 1,714     |\n\nIn each assessment, the value-in-use has been calculated assuming a stable regulatory framework and is based on projections that incorporate our best estimates of future cash flows, including costs, changes in commodity prices, future rates and growth. Such projections reflect our current regulatory agreements, taking into account regulatory arrangements to allow for future agreements and recovery of investment, including those related to achieving the net zero plans of the jurisdictions that we operate in. Our plans have proved to be reliable guides in the past and the Directors believe the estimates are appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## 11. Goodwill continued\n\n## (a) Cash flow periods, terminal value and discount rate assumptions\n\nWe select cash flow durations longer than five years, when our forecasts are considered reliable. The cash flow durations selected reflect our knowledge and understanding of the regulatory environments in which we operate, and most significantly, where markets have legislated decarbonisation commitments by 2050, we utilise longer cash flow forecasts that reflect the investment required to deliver those commitments before applying a terminal value at the point those commitments are due to be fulfilled and market growth is expected to stabilise. For our regulated WPD operations, we consider cash flow durations that run until 2050, reflecting the expected investment required in the network, in excess of economy -wide long-term growth rates in order to deliver the energy transition. For our regulated US operations (New York and New England CGUs), we use a five-year cash flow forecast.\n\nFor our WPD business, a nominal terminal growth rate of 2.5% is assumed upon the terminal year cash flows, reflecting management's best view, based on market and operational experience, of the expected long-term growth in the relevant market. For our US regulated operations, due to differences in the regulatory framework and the combination of gas and electricity networks, we apply a growth rate of 2.25%. This has been determined with regard to data on industry growth projections, specifically related to the energy transition, and projected growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) for the territory within which the CGU is based.\n\nPre-tax cash flows are discounted by applying a pre-tax discount rate reflecting the time value of money and the risks specific to the group of assets. In practice, the post-tax discount rate for the group of assets in question is taken as a starting point, before considering industry peer discount rates to apply adjustments, as required, ensuring the rate applied is independent of the entity's capital structure and to reflect a market participants' view of a risk adjusted discount rate specific to the CGU or group of CGUs. The post-tax discount rate is then grossed up to a pre-tax discount rate that is applied to pre-tax cash flows. The pre-tax discount rates used for the year ended 31 March 2022 were as follows: WPD Group 5.2%; WPD DNOs 4.9%; New York 5.5%; and New England 5.6%.\n\nThe discount rate and terminal growth rate applied in the year ended 31 March 2021 to the CGUs assessed at that date were 5.3% and 2.1% respectively.\n\n## (b) Key inputs and sensitivity analysis\n\nIn assessing the carrying value of goodwill and licences, we have sensitised our forecasts to factor in adjustments to key inputs to each model. Whilst regulatory licences are tested for impairment before we test goodwill, we consider the sensitivity for all balances separately for WPD and our regulated US operations below.\n\n## WPD goodwill\n\nWe identified the discount rate and the terminal growth rate as key assumptions for which the value-in-use calculation is the most sensitive in our impairment review. A reduction in the terminal growth rate to 2% resulted in WPD's carrying amount equalling its recoverable amount. Considering the sensitivity to the discount rate applied, we found that increasing the pre-tax discount rate by 0.2% (to 5.4%) will result in WPD's carrying amount equalling its recoverable amount (see notes 1 and 35).\n\n## WPD indefinite-lived regulatory licences\n\nNo reasonable changes to inputs to the impairment test performed over the South West, East Midlands, West Midlands and South Wales Distribution Network Operator CGUs were identified as resulting in an impairment.\n\n## Regulated US operations: New York and New England goodwill\n\nWhile it is possible that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable change would result in an impairment of goodwill, in view of the long-term nature of the key assumptions and the margin by which the estimated value-in-use exceeds the carrying amount. This remains the case even after taking into account the short-term effects of COVID-19 and inflationary pressures, the most significant of which is an increase in bad debt charges in the short term, but not a risk of impairment to goodwill.",

Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include software which is written down (amortised) over the period we expect to receive a benefit from the asset. An amortisation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect the reduced value of the asset over time. Amortisation is calculated by estimating the number of years we expect the asset to be used (useful economic life or UEL) and charging the cost of the asset to the income statement equally over this period.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangibles comprise regulatory licences for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inflows. These assets are considered to have an indefinite life and are not amortised but subject to a review for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Any impairment is charged to the income statement as it arises.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment, with the exception of regulatory licences that are assessed to have indefinite lives and are therefore tested annually for impairment (see note 11 for details of impairment tests performed over indefinite-lived intangible assets). Other intangible assets are tested for impairment only if there is an indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired. Impairments of assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower. Where such an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the CGU to which that asset belongs is estimated. Impairments are recognised in the consolidated income statement within Other operating income and costs. Any assets which suffered impairment in a previous period are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.\n\nThe Group's regulatory licences relate to electricity distribution licences acquired in connection with the Group's acquisition of WPD on 14 June 2021 (see note 37). The licences provide the right to operate and invest in the relevant network that operates as a monopoly in the licensed geographic area. Once granted by Ofgem, the licence is issued to a licensee on the basis that it remains active into perpetuity. On that basis, the value attributed to the electricity distribution network licence assets is considered to have an indefinite useful life.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets, such as software, are recognised only if: i) an asset is created that can be identified; ii) it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and iii) the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recorded as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\nCloud computing arrangements are reviewed to determine if the Group has control of the software intangible asset. Control is considered to exist where the Group has the right to take possession of the software and run it on its own or a third party's computer infrastructure or if the Group has exclusive rights to use the software such that the supplier is unable to make the software available to other customers.\n\nCosts relating to configuring or customising the software in a cloud computing arrangement are assessed to determine if there is a separate intangible asset over which the Group has control. If an asset is identified, it is capitalised and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset. To the extent that no separate intangible asset is identified, then the costs are either expensed when incurred or recognised as a prepayment and spread over the term of the arrangement if the costs are concluded to not be distinct.\n\nThe accounting for costs incurred in cloud computing arrangements represents the application of new accounting guidance for the Group for the year ended 31 March 2022. Certain costs which were previously capitalised in respect of the Group's cloud computing arrangements have been expensed in the period.",

The cost of these assets primarily represents the amount initially paid for them or the fair value on the date of acquisition of a business. Cost includes both their purchase price and the construction and other costs associated with getting them ready for operation. A depreciation expense is charged to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset over time. Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years we expect the asset to be used (useful economic life or UEL) and charging the cost of the asset to the income statement equally over this period.\n\nWe operate an energy networks business and therefore have a significant physical asset base. We continue to invest in our networks to maintain reliability, create new customer connections and ensure our networks are flexible and resilient. Our business plan envisages these additional investments will be funded through a mixture of cash generated from operations and the issue of new debt.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Cost includes the purchase price of the asset; any payroll and finance costs incurred which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment together with an appropriate portion of overheads which are directly linked to the capital work performed; and the cost of any associated asset retirement obligations.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes assets in which the Group's interest comprises legally protected statutory or contractual rights of use. Additions represent the purchase or construction of new assets, including capital expenditure for safety and environmental assets, and extensions to, enhancements to, or replacement of, existing assets. All costs associated with projects or activities which have not been fully commissioned at the period end are classified within assets in the course of construction.\n\nItems within property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment only if there is some indication that the carrying value of the assets may have been impaired. Impairments of assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the recoverable amount, if lower. Where such an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which that asset belongs is estimated. Impairments are recognised in the income statement and if immaterial are included within the depreciation charge for the year.\n\n## (a) Analysis of property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                             | Land and buildings \u00a3m   | Plant and machinery \u00a3m   | Assets  in the  course of  construction \u00a3m   | Motor  vehicles  and office  equipment \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Cost at 1 April 2020                        | 3,897                   | 59,609                   | 4,771                                        | 1,036                                       | 69,313     |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | (213)                   | (3,308)                  | (130)                                        | (73)                                        | (3,724)    |\n| Additions                                   | 89                      | 328                      | 4,023                                        | 70                                          | 4,510      |\n| Disposals                                   | (6)                     | (344)                    | (26)                                         | (48)                                        | (424)      |\n| Reclassifications\u00b9                          | 96                      | 3,007                    | (3,243)                                      | 77                                          | (63)       |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (111)                   | (3,231)                  | (174)                                        | (44)                                        | (3,560)    |\n| Cost at 1 April 2021                        | 3,752                   | 56,061                   | 5,221                                        | 1,018                                       | 66,052     |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | 97                      | 1,627                    | 111                                          | 37                                          | 1,872      |\n| Additions                                   | 22                      | 926                      | 4,843                                        | 129                                         | 5,920      |\n| Acquisition of WPD (note 37)                | 200                     | 9,512                    | 185                                          | 154                                         | 10,051     |\n| Disposals                                   | (165)                   | (367)                    | -

Other items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated, on a straight-line basis, at rates estimated to write off their book values over their estimated useful economic lives. In assessing estimated useful economic lives, consideration is given to any contractual arrangements and operational requirements relating to particular assets. The assessments of estimated useful economic lives and residual values of assets are performed annually.\n\nUnless otherwise determined by operational requirements, the depreciation periods for the principal categories of property, plant and equipment are, in general, as shown in the table below split between the UK and US, along with the weighted average remaining UEL for each class of property, plant and equipment (which is calculated by applying the annual depreciation charge per class of asset to the net book value of that class of asset).\n\n|                                                      | Years     | Years     | Years                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                      | UK        | US        | Weighted  average  remaining UEL\u00b9 |\n| Freehold and leasehold buildings                     | up to 60  | up to 100 | 41                                |\n| Plant and machinery:                                 |           |           |                                   |\n| Electricity transmission plant and wires             | up to 100 | 45 to 80  | 31                                |\n| Electricity distribution plant                       | 3 to 99   | 35 to 85  | 45                                |\n| Electricity generation plant                         | n/a       | 20 to 93  | 12                                |\n| Interconnector plant and other                       | 5 to 60   | 5 to 50   | 32                                |\n| Gas plant - mains, services and regulating equipment | n/a       | 47 to 80  | 55                                |\n| Gas plant - storage                                  | 5 to 40   | 12 to 65  | 12                                |\n| Gas plant - meters                                   | 7 to 30   | 14 to 40  | 24                                |\n| Motor vehicles and office equipment                  | up to 30  | up to 26  | 5                                 |\n\n## (c) Gas asset lives\n\nThe role that gas networks play in the pathway to achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets set in the jurisdictions in which we operate is currently uncertain. However, we believe the gas assets which we own and operate today will continue to have a crucial role in maintaining security, reliability and affordability of energy beyond 2050, although the scale and purpose for which the networks will be used is dependent on technological developments and policy choices of governments and regulators.\n\nWith respect to our US gas distribution assets, asset lives are assessed as part of detailed depreciation studies completed as part of each separate rate proceeding. Depreciation studies consider the physical condition of assets and the expected operational life of an asset. We believe these assessments are our best estimate of the UEL of our gas network assets in the US.\n\nThe weighted average remaining UEL for our US gas distribution fixed asset base is circa 58 years, however a sizeable proportion of our assets are assumed to have UELs which extend beyond 2080. We continue to believe the lives identified by rate proceedings are the best estimate of the assets' UELs, although we continue to keep this assumption under review as we learn more about possible future pathways towards net zero. Whilst the targets, goals and ambitions have now been formalised in legislation in the states in which we operate, there is widespread recognition that work needs to be done to define the possible future decarbonisation pathways. We continue to actively engage and support our regulators to enable the clean energy transition in a safe, reliable and affordable way.\n\nAsset depreciation lives feed directly into our US regulatory recovery mechanisms, such that any shortening of asset lives and regulatory recovery periods as agreed with regulators should be recoverable through future rates, subject to agreement, over future periods, as part of wider considerations around ensuring the continuing affordability of gas in our service territories.\n\nGiven the uncertainty described relating to the UELs of our gas assets, below we provide a sensitivity on the depreciation charge for our New York and New England segments were a shorter UEL presumed:\n\n|                      | Increase in depreciation expense for  the year ended 31 March 2022   | Increase in depreciation expense for  the year ended 31 March 2022   | Increase in depreciation expense for  the year ended 31 March 2021 1   | Increase in depreciation expense for  the year ended 31 March 2021 1   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | New York  \u00a3m                                                         | New England \u00a3m                                                       | New York \u00a3m                                                            | New England \u00a3m                                                         |\n| UELs limited to 2050 | 140                                                                  | 40                                                                   | 125                                                                    | 35                                                                     |\n| UELs limited to 2060 | 67                                                                   | 15                                                                   | 57                                                                     | 13                                                                     |\n| UELs limited to 2070 | 31                                                                   | 1                                                                    | 26                                                                     | 2                                                                      |",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## (c) Gas asset lives continued\n\nNote that this sensitivity calculation excludes any assumptions regarding the residual value for our asset base and the effect that shortening asset depreciation lives would be expected to have on our regulatory recovery mechanisms. In the event that any of the US gas distribution assets are stranded, the Group would expect to recover the associated costs. While recovery is not guaranteed and is determined by regulators in the US, there are precedents for stranded asset cost recovery for US utility companies.\n\n## (d) Right-of-use assets\n\nThe Group leases various properties, land, equipment and cars. New lease arrangements entered into are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. The right-of-use asset and associated lease liability arising from a lease are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments expected over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments, any variable lease payments dependent on an index or a rate, and any break fees or renewal option costs that we are reasonably certain to incur. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease or, if that is not available, then the incremental rate of borrowing for a similar term and similar security (which is determined based on observable data for borrowing rates for the specific group entity that has entered into the lease, with specific adjustments for the term of the lease and any lease-specific risk premium). The lease term takes account of exercising any extension options that are at our option if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option and any lease termination options unless we are reasonably certain not to exercise the option. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period using the effective interest rate method. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. For shortterm leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (such as computers), the Group continues to recognise a lease expense on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe table below shows the movements in the net book value of right-of-use assets included within property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, split by category. The associated lease liabilities are disclosed in note 21.\n\n|                                             | Land and buildings \u00a3m   | Plant and machinery \u00a3m   | Assets  in the  course of  construction \u00a3m   | Motor  vehicles  and office  equipment \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Net book value at 1 April 2020              | 364                     | 95                       | -                                            | 225                                         | 684        |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | (30)                    | (4)                      | -                                            | (22)                                        | (56)       |\n| Additions                                   | 60                      | 6                        | -                                            | 64                                          | 130        |\n| Reclassifications                           | -                       | -                        | -                                            | (15)                                        | (15)       |\n| Depreciation charge for the year            | (29)                    | (16)                     | -                                            | (68)                                        | (113)      |\n| Net book value at 31 March 2021             | 365                     | 81                       | -                                            | 184                                         | 630        |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | 10                      | 1                        | -                                            | 10                                          | 21         |\n| Additions                                   | 14                      | 2                        | -                                            | 88                                          | 104        |\n| Acquisition of WPD (note 37)                | 7                       | 2                        | -                                            | -                                           | 9          |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (7)                     | -                        | -                                            | (4)                                         | (11)       |\n| Modifications of leases\u00b9                    | (122)                   | -                        | -                                            | -                                           | (122)      |\n| Disposals                                   | (2)                     | -                        | -                                            | (1)                                         | (3)        |\n| Depreciation charge for the year            | (40)                    | (16)                     | -                                            | (67)                                        | (123)      |\n| Net book value at 31 March 2022             | 225                     | 70                       | -                                            | 210                                         | 505        |\n\nThe following balances have been included in the income statement for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 in respect of right-of-use assets:\n\n|                                                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Included within net finance income and costs:       |           |           |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities               | (18)      | (21)      |\n| Included within revenue:                            |           |           |\n| Lease income\u00b9                                       | 385       | 390       |\n| Included within operating expenses:                 |           |           |\n| Expense relating to short-term and low-value leases | (14)      | (13)      |\n\nThe total of future minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases is \u00a3108 million (2021: \u00a3104 million).",

Financial and other investments\n\nThe Group holds a range of financial and other investments. These investments include short-term money market funds, quoted investments in equities or bonds of other companies, investments in our venture capital portfolio (National Grid Partners), bank deposits with a maturity of greater than three months, and investments that can not be readily used in operations, principally collateral deposited in relation to derivatives.\n\nThe classification of each investment held by the Group is determined based on two main factors:\n\n- \u00b7 its contractual cash flows - whether the assets cash flows are solely payments of the principal and interest on the financial asset on pre-determined dates or whether the cash flows are determined by other factors such as the performance of a company; and\n- \u00b7 the business model for holding the investments - whether the intention is to hold onto the investment for the longer term (collect the contractual cash flows), or to sell the asset with the intention of managing any gain or loss on sale or to manage any liquidity requirements.\n\nThe four categories of financial and other investments are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortised cost - debt instruments that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, and which are held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows, are held at amortised cost. This category includes our receivables in relation to deposits and collateral;\n- \u00b7 FVOCI debt and other investments - debt investments, such as bonds, that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest, and which are held within a business model whose objective is both to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the debt instruments, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), with gains or losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income instead of through the income statement. On disposal, any gains or losses are recognised within finance income in the income statement (see note 6). Other investments include insurance contracts, measured at fair value, and held to back the present value of unfunded pension liabilities in note 25;\n- \u00b7 FVOCI equity instruments - the Group previously held equity instruments which it elected to measure at FVOCI on the basis that they were not held for trading and so the recognition of any gains and losses on these investments in the income statement would not have been representative of performance. The shares were held as part of a portfolio of financial instruments which back some long-term employee liabilities. In the year ended 31 March 2022, the Group sold all of the remaining equities as part of a plan to de-risk that investment portfolio. The fair value of the equities on the date of sale was \u00a3111 million and upon disposal realised gains and losses of \u00a382 million were transferred to retained earnings (see note 28); and\n- \u00b7 FVTPL investments - other financial investments are subsequently measured at fair value with any gains or losses recognised in the income statement (FVTPL). This primarily comprises our money market funds, insurance company fund investments and corporate venture capital investments held by National Grid Partners.\n\nFinancial and other investments are initially recognised on trade date. Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial assets that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices. When independent prices are not available, fair values are determined using valuation techniques used by the relevant markets using observable market data where possible (see note 32(g) for further details).",

The carrying value of current financial assets at amortised cost approximates their fair values, primarily due to short-dated maturities. The exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the financial investments. For further information on our credit risk, refer to note 32(a).\n\nFor the purposes of impairment assessment, the investments in bonds are considered to be low risk as they are investment grade securities; life insurance policies are held with regulated insurance companies; and deposits, collateral receivable and other financial assets at amortised cost are investment grade. All financial assets held at FVOCI or amortised cost are therefore considered to have low credit risk and have an immaterial impairment loss allowance equal to 12-month expected credit losses.\n\nIn determining the expected credit losses for these assets, some or all of the following information has been considered: credit ratings, the financial position of counterparties, the future prospects of the relevant industries and general economic forecasts.\n\nNo FVOCI or amortised cost financial assets have had modified cash flows during the period. There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the year in assessing the loss allowance for these financial assets. There were no significant movements in the gross carrying value of financial assets during the year that contribute to changes in the loss allowance. No collateral is held in respect of any of the financial investments in the above table. No balances are more than 30 days past due, and no balances were written off during the year.",

Investments in joint ventures and associates\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates represent businesses we do not control but over which we exercise joint control or significant influence. They are accounted for using the equity method. A joint venture is an arrangement established to engage in economic activity, which the Group jointly controls with other parties and has rights to a share of the net assets of the arrangement. An associate is an entity which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture, but over which the Group has significant influence.\n\n|                                                               | 2022          | 2022              | 2022     | 2021          | 2021               | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|----------|---------------|--------------------|----------|\n|                                                               | Associates \u00a3m | Joint ventures \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Associates \u00a3m | Joint  ventures \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Share of net assets at 1 April                                | 229           | 638               | 867      | 341           | 654                | 995      |\n| Exchange adjustments                                          | 6             | 19                | 25       | (22)          | (36)               | (58)     |\n| Additions                                                     | 17            | 469               | 486      | 6             | 75                 | 81       |\n| Share of post-tax results for the year                        | 43            | 49                | 92       | 30            | 28                 | 58       |\n| Share of other comprehensive income of associates, net of tax | 1             | -                 | 1        | 1             | -                  | 1        |\n| Dividends received                                            | (35)          | (123)             | (158)    | (31)          | (49)               | (80)     |\n| Disposals                                                     | -             | (50)              | (50)     | -             | -                  | -        |\n| Other movements\u00b9                                              | 16            | (41)              | (25)     | (96)          | (34)               | (130)    |\n| Share of net assets at 31 March                               | 277           | 961               | 1,238    | 229           | 638                | 867      |\n\nA list of joint ventures and associates including the name and proportion of ownership is provided in note 34.

Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodities, equities or other indices. In accordance with policies approved by the Board, derivatives are transacted generally to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Our derivatives balances comprise two broad categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financing derivatives: These are used to manage our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Specifically, we use these derivatives to manage our financing portfolio, holdings in foreign operations and contractual operational cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 commodity contract derivatives: These are used to manage our US customers' exposure to price and supply risks. Some forward contracts for the purchase of commodities meet the definition of derivatives. We also enter into derivative financial instruments linked to commodity prices, including index futures, options and swaps, which are used to manage market price volatility.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Changes in fair values are recorded in the period they arise, in either the consolidated income statement or other comprehensive income. Where the gains or losses recorded in the income statement arise from changes in the fair value of derivatives to the extent that hedge accounting is not applied or is not fully effective, these are recorded as remeasurements, detailed in notes 5 and 6. Where the fair value of a derivative is positive it is carried as a derivative asset, and where negative as a derivative liability.\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by taking the present value of future cash flows, primarily incorporating market observable inputs. The various inputs include foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate and inflation curves, the forward rate curves of underlying commodities, and for those positions that are not fully cash collateralised, the credit quality of the counterparties.\n\nCertain clauses embedded in non-derivative financial instruments or other contracts are presented as derivatives because they impact the risk profile of their host contracts and they are deemed to have risks or rewards not closely related to those host contracts.\n\nFurther information on how derivatives are valued and used for risk management purposes is presented in note 32. Information on commodity contracts and other commitments not meeting the definition of derivatives is presented in note 30.\n\nThe fair values of derivatives by category are as follows:\n\n|                                | 2022      | 2022           | 2022     | 2021      | 2021           | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|\n|                                | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Current                        | 282       | (144)          | 138      | 457       | (145)          | 312      |\n| Non-current                    | 305       | (869)          | (564)    | 542       | (754)          | (212)    |\n|                                | 587       | (1,013)        | (426)    | 999       | (899)          | 100      |\n| Financing derivatives          | 298       | (991)          | (693)    | 942       | (767)          | 175      |\n| Commodity contract derivatives | 289       | (22)           | 267      | 57        | (132)          | (75)     |\n|                                | 587       | (1,013)        | (426)    | 999       | (899)          | 100      |\n\n## (a) Financing derivatives\n\nThe fair values of financing derivatives by type are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 2022      | 2022           | 2022     | 2021      | 2021           | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|\n|                                     | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Interest rate swaps                 | 89        | (97)           | (8)      | 325       | (159)          | 166      |\n| Cross-currency interest rate swaps  | 174       | (642)          | (468)    | 601       | (351)          | 250      |\n| Foreign exchange forward contracts\u00b9 | 35        | (65)           | (30)     | 16        | (74)           | (58)     |\n| Inflation-linked swaps              | -         | (187)          | (187)    | -         | (183)          | (183)    |\n|                                     | 298       | (991)          | (693)    | 942       | (767)          | 175      |",

Inventories and current intangible assets\n\nInventories represent assets that we intend to use in order to generate revenue in the short term, either by selling the asset itself (for example, fuel stocks) or by using it to fulfil a service to a customer or to maintain our network (consumables).\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value. Where applicable, cost comprises direct materials and direct labour costs as well as those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nEmission allowances, principally relating to the emissions of carbon dioxide in the UK and sulphur and nitrous oxides in the US, are recorded as intangible assets within current assets. They are initially recorded at cost and subsequently at the lower of cost and net realisable value. A liability is recorded in respect of the obligation to deliver emission allowances, and emission charges are recognised in the income statement in the period in which emissions are made.\n\n|                                                 |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fuel stocks                                     |        96 |        94 |\n| Raw materials and consumables                   |       297 |       253 |\n| Current intangible assets - emission allowances |       118 |        92 |\n|                                                 |       511 |       439 |\n\nThere is a provision for obsolescence of \u00a37 million against inventories as at 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a310 million).",

The maximum exposure of trade and other receivables to credit risk is the carrying amount reported on the balance sheet.\n\n## Provision for impairment of receivables\n\nA provision for credit losses is recognised at an amount equal to the expected credit losses that will arise over the lifetime of the trade receivables and accrued income.\n\n|                                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 April                                  | 672       | 512       |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | 31        | (57)      |\n| Charge for the year, net of recoveries      | 167       | 326       |\n| Uncollectible amounts written off           | (124)     | (59)      |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (5)       | (50)      |\n| At 31 March                                 | 741       | 672       |\n\nThe trade receivables balance, accrued income balance and provisions balance split by geography are as follows:\n\n|                                                            | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                            | UK \u00a3m                 | US \u00a3m                 | Total \u00a3m              | UK \u00a3m                 | US \u00a3m                 | Total \u00a3m              |\n| Trade receivables                                          | 352                   | 2,309                 | 2,661                 | 227                   | 1,925                 | 2,152                 |\n| Accrued income                                             | 715                   | 395                   | 1,110                 | 547                   | 339                   | 886                   |\n| Provision for impairment of receivables and accrued income | (43)                  | (698)                 | (741)                 | (23)                  | (649)                 | (672)                 |\n|                                                            | 1,024                 | 2,006                 | 3,030                 | 751                   | 1,615                 | 2,366                 |\n\nThere are no retail customers in the UK businesses. A provision matrix is not used in the UK as an assessment of expected losses on individual debtors is performed, and the provision is not material.\n\nIn the US, \u00a32,243 million (2021: \u00a31,852 million) of the trade receivables and accrued income balance is attributable to retail customers. For non-retail US customer receivables, a provision matrix is not used and expected losses are determined on individual debtors.\n\nThe provision for retail customer receivables in the US is calculated based on a series of provision matrices which are prepared by regulated entity and by customer type. The expected loss rates in each provision matrix are based on historical loss rates adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions at the balance sheet date. The inclusion of forward-looking information in the provision matrix setting process under IFRS 9 results in loss rates that reflect expected future economic conditions and the recognition of an expected loss on all debtors even where no loss event has occurred.\n\nIn March 2020, the Group's US distribution businesses ceased certain customer cash collection activities in response to regulatory instructions and to changes in State, Federal and City level regulations and guidance, and actions to minimise risk to the Group's employees as a result of COVID-19. At that time, the Group also ceased customer termination activities as requested by relevant local authorities. Collection and customer termination activities resumed in New England during the year ended 31 March 2022, where permitted. Whilst certain collection activities also resumed in New York in the year, we expect to resume full collection activities over the course of the next year. Collection activities have also been supported by certain government COVID funding programmes in both New England and New York.\n\nIn calculating our provision for impairment of receivables at 31 March 2022, we were able to incorporate the actual cash collection levels experienced for the two years since the start of the pandemic to determine the expected loss rates per category of outstanding receivable by operating company, which is summarised in the provision matrix shown below. Factored into our analysis are expected cash collections based on the resumed collection activities in New England and New York during the year.",

Trade and other receivables continued\n\nBased on our review, we recognised a charge of \u00a3139 million which represents our best estimate based on the information available. For the year ended 31 March 2021, we recognised a charge of \u00a3325 million due to the ongoing reduction of customer terminations and collections which were ceased in the preceding year and not fully recovered as at 31 March 2022. We based our review of certain macroeconomic factors at the time, including unemployment levels and our experience regarding debtor recoverability during and in the aftermath of the 2008/09 financial crisis.\n\nThe average expected loss rates and gross balances for the retail customer receivables in our US operations are set out below:\n\n|                         | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|                         | %      | \u00a3m     | %      | \u00a3m     |\n| Accrued income          | 5      | 382    | 7      | 322    |\n| 0 - 30 days past due    | 5      | 731    | 7      | 580    |\n| 30 - 60 days past due   | 20     | 213    | 24     | 155    |\n| 60 - 90 days past due   | 32     | 123    | 36     | 108    |\n| 3 - 6 months past due   | 41     | 161    | 52     | 140    |\n| 6 - 12 months past due  | 56     | 177    | 66     | 180    |\n| Over 12 months past due | 71     | 456    | 71     | 367    |\n|                         |        | 2,243  |        | 1,852  |\n\nUS retail customer receivables are not collateralised. Trade receivables are written off when regulatory requirements are met. Write-off policies vary between jurisdictions as they are aligned with the local regulatory requirements, which differ between regulators. There were no significant amounts written off during the period that were still subject to enforcement action. Our internal definition of default is aligned with that of the individual regulators in each jurisdiction.\n\nFor further information on our wholesale and retail credit risk, refer to note 32(a).\n\n## 20. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, together with short-term investments with an original maturity of less than three months that are readily convertible to cash.\n\nNet cash and cash equivalents reflected in the cash flow statement are net of bank overdrafts, which are reported in borrowings. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts approximate their fair values.\n\nCash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates. Short-term deposits are made for periods varying between one day and three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\nCash and cash equivalents held in currencies other than sterling have been converted into sterling at year-end exchange rates. For further information on currency exposures, refer to note 32(c).\n\nCash and cash equivalents at 31 March 2022 include \u00a314 million (2021: \u00a312 million) that is restricted. The restricted cash balances include amounts required to be maintained for insurance purposes and cash balances that can only be used for low-carbon network fund projects.\n\n|                           | 2022 \u00a3m   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank              | 204       |       117 |\n| Short-term deposits       | -         |        40 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 204       |       157 |",

These are for a fixed term and may have fixed or floating interest rates or are linked to inflation indices. We use derivatives to manage risks associated with interest rates, inflation rates and foreign exchange. Lease liabilities are also included within borrowings.\n\nOur price controls and rate plans lead us to fund our networks within a certain ratio of debt to equity or regulatory asset value and, as a result, we have issued a significant amount of debt. As we continue to invest in our networks, the value of debt is expected to increase over time. To maintain a strong balance sheet and to allow us to access capital markets at commercially acceptable interest rates, we balance the amount of debt we issue with the value of our assets, and we take account of certain other metrics used by credit rating agencies.\n\nAll borrowings are measured at amortised cost, with the exception of one current liability which was measured at fair value through profit and loss in order to eliminate a measurement mismatch. This current liability has now matured.\n\nBorrowings, which include interest-bearing, zero-coupon and inflation-linked debt, overdrafts and collateral payable, are initially recorded at fair value. This normally reflects the proceeds received (net of direct issue costs for liabilities measured at amortised cost). Subsequently, borrowings are stated either: i) at amortised cost; or ii) at fair value though profit and loss. Where a borrowing is held at amortised cost, any difference between the proceeds after direct issue costs and the redemption value is recognised over the term of the borrowing in the income statement using the effective interest method. For the liability held at fair value through profit and loss, interest is calculated using the effective interest method.\n\nWhere a borrowing or liability is held at fair value, changes in the fair value of the borrowing due to changes in the issuer's credit risk are recorded in the own credit reserve within equity (see note 28). All other changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement within remeasurements (see notes 5 and 6).\n\n|                   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current           |           |           |\n| Bank loans\u00b9       | 8,976     | 1,022     |\n| Bonds\u00b2            | 1,735     | 1,987     |\n| Commercial paper  | 1,303     | 628       |\n| Lease liabilities | 107       | 99        |\n| Other loans       | -         | 1         |\n|                   | 12,121    | 3,737     |\n| Non-current       |           |           |\n| Bank loans        | 2,211     | 2,532     |\n| Bonds             | 30,682    | 24,209    |\n| Lease liabilities | 451       | 586       |\n| Other loans       | -         | 156       |\n|                   | 33,344    | 27,483    |\n| Total borrowings  | 45,465    | 31,220    |",

Where market values were available, the fair value of borrowings (Level 1) was \u00a324,454 million (2021: \u00a320,333 million). Where market values were not available, the fair value of borrowings (Level 2) was \u00a321,170 million (2021: \u00a314,343 million), and calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The notional amount outstanding of the debt portfolio at 31 March 2022 was \u00a344,055 million (2021: \u00a331,010 million). There have been no new issuances since the year end.\n\nCollateral is placed with or received from any derivative counterparty where we have entered into a credit support annex to the ISDA Master Agreement once the current mark-to-market valuation of the trades between the parties exceeds an agreed threshold. Included in current bank loans is \u00a360 million (2021: \u00a3582 million) in respect of cash received under collateral agreements. For further details of our borrowing facilities, refer to note 33. For further details of our bonds in issue, please refer to the debt investor section of our website. Unless included herein, the information on our website is unaudited.\n\nCertain borrowings, primarily some of our USD denominated bank loans and company car lease contracts, have payments that are linked to LIBOR. LIBOR is being replaced as an interest rate benchmark by alternative reference rates and therefore we are transitioning LIBOR cash flows on our affected contracts in line with the relevant jurisdictions. The migration project is underway, with all affected contracts where we previously paid or received GBP LIBOR amended in the year to 31 March 2022. \u00a3314 million (2021: \u00a3328 million) of bank loans affected by GBP LIBOR have been transitioned to alternative reference rates. \u00a3181 million (2021: \u00a3173 million) of lease liabilities affected by USD LIBOR have been transitioned to alternative rates and \u00a3110 million (2021: \u00a359 million) of bank loans affected by USD LIBOR have yet to be amended.\n\n## Financial liability at fair value through profit and loss\n\nThe financial liability was designated at fair value through profit and loss. Up until the date of maturity in November 2021, the liability was analysed as follows:\n\n- i.  the fair value of the liability at maturity in November 2021 was \u00a3699 million (2021: \u00a3682 million), which included cumulative changes in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk recognised in other comprehensive income, post tax of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a31 million);\n- ii.  the amount repayable at maturity in November 2021 was \u00a3699 million (2021: \u00a3684 million); and\n- iii. the difference between carrying amount and contractual amount at maturity was \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a32 million).\n\nThis liability was reclassified in order to eliminate a measurement mismatch with derivatives which provide an economic hedge. The associated derivatives were collateralised and did not contain significant exposure to our own credit risk. The presentation of credit risk in other comprehensive income did not, therefore, create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.\n\nThe change in the fair value attributable to a change in credit risk was calculated as the difference between the total change in the fair value of the liability and the change in the value of the liability due to changes in market risk factors alone. The change in the fair value due to market risk factors was calculated using benchmark yield curves as at the end of the reporting period holding the credit risk margin constant. The fair value of the liability was calculated using observed market prices.",

The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease or if that is not available, then the incremental rate of borrowing for a similar term and similar security. The lease term takes account of exercising any extension options that are at our option if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option and any lease termination options unless we are reasonably certain not to exercise the option.

These amounts are recognised as revenue when the service is provided.\n\nTrade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, with the exception of contingent consideration, which is subsequently measured at fair value.\n\n|                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Trade payables                  | 3,113     | 2,165     |\n| Deferred payables               | 487       | 154       |\n| Customer contributions\u00b9         | 137       | 138       |\n| Social security and other taxes | 278       | 140       |\n| Contingent consideration        | 34        | 39        |\n| Other payables                  | 866       | 881       |\n|                                 | 4,915     | 3,517     |\n\nDue to their short maturities, the fair value of trade payables approximates their carrying value.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 25. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAll of our employees are eligible to participate in a pension plan. We have defined contribution (DC) and defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the UK and the US. In the US we also provide healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, post-retirement. The fair value of associated plan assets and present value of DB obligations are updated annually in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits'. We separately present our UK and US pension plans to show the geographical split. Below we provide a more detailed analysis of the amounts recorded in the primary financial statements and the actuarial assumptions used to value the DB obligations.\n\n## UK pension plans\n\n## Defined contribution plan\n\nEmployees of National Grid's legacy UK businesses are eligible to join the National Grid UK Retirement Plan (NGUKRP), a section of a Master Trust arrangement managed by Legal & General. National Grid pays contributions into the NGUKRP to provide DC benefits on behalf of its employees, generally providing a double match of member contributions up to a maximum Company contribution of 12% of salary. Additionally, WPD operates a DC pension plan (WPPS) which includes three separate DC sections. Two of the DC sections are closed with no active members at 31 March 2022. There is also an open section, available to all new WPD employees.\n\nThese plans are defined contribution in nature and are designed to provide members with a pension pot for their retirement. As such, investment risks are borne by the member and there is no legal or constructive obligation on National Grid to pay additional contributions in the instance that investment performance is poor. Payments to these DC plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nNational Grid operates various DB pension plans in the UK. These include two legally separate sections of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme (Section A and Section B of NGUKPS), three sections of the industry-wide Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS) and a legacy scheme (WPUPS). During the year, following National Grid's announcement of its intention to sell its Gas Transmission and Metering businesses, Section B of NGUKPS was reallocated as held for sale. Each of these plans holds its assets in separate Trustee administered funds. The arrangements are managed by Trustee companies with boards consisting of company- and member-appointed directors. These plans are all closed to new members except for the ESPS schemes in very rare circumstances.\n\nThe arrangements are subject to independent actuarial funding valuations every three years, and following consultation and agreement with the Company, the qualified actuary certifies the employers' contributions, which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the plans' assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable. The latest full actuarial valuations for each of the DB plans were carried out at 31 March 2019, with the Company agreeing to fund the assessed funding shortfalls for the UK DB plans that were in deficit via recovery plan payments scheduled to finish in November 2024 or earlier, with payments of approximately \u00a3130 million across all plans still due to be paid. Separately, National Grid continues to fund the cost of future benefit accrual (over and above member contributions) for each of the DB schemes. In the year to March 2022, the aggregate level of ongoing contributions (excluding recovery plan payments) was \u00a383 million (2021: \u00a350 million; 2020: \u00a370 million). National Grid also pays contributions in respect of the costs of plan administration and the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) levies for most of its DB plans.\n\nIn addition, for some plans the Company has also agreed to establish security arrangements with charges in favour of the Trustee. The value of security provided across National Grid's DB plans was \u00a3286 million at 31 March 2022, all of which is currently provided in the form of surety bonds but may also be provided as letters of credit or cash. The assets held as security will be paid to the respective section or plan in the event that the relevant supporting employer is subject to an insolvency event or fails to make the required contributions; and applicable to NGEG of ESPS only, if NGET loses its licence to operate under relevant legislation. Counter indemnities have also been taken out to ensure the obligations will be fulfilled. In addition, further cash payments of up to a maximum of \u00a3675 million could also become due if certain trigger events occur which have been individually agreed between the plans and their relevant supporting employers.\n\nA guarantee has also been provided to Section A of NGUKPS, with the payment contingent on insolvency or on failure to pay pension obligations to Section A and can be claimed against National Grid plc, National Grid Holdings One plc or Lattice Group Limited.\n\n## US pension plans\n\nThe US pension plans are governed by a fiduciary committee called the Retirement Plan Committee (RPC). The RPC is structured in accordance with US laws governing retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and comprises appointed employees of the Company.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nNational Grid has a DC pension plan which allows employee as well as Company contributions. Non-union employees hired after 1 January 2011, as well as most new hire represented union employees, receive a core contribution into the DC plan ranging from 3% to 9% of salary, irrespective of the employee's contribution into the plan. Most employees also receive a matching contribution that varies between 25% and 50% of employee contributions up to a maximum of 8% to 10%. The assets of the plans are held in trusts and administered by the RPC.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nNational Grid sponsors four non-contributory qualified DB pension plans, which provide vested union employees, and vested non-union employees hired before 1 January 2011, with retirement benefits within prescribed limits as defined by the US Internal Revenue Service. National Grid also provides non-qualified DB pension arrangements for a section of current and former employees, which are closed to new entrants. Benefits under the DB plans generally reflect age, years of service and compensation, and are paid in the form of an annuity or lump sum. An independent actuary performs valuations annually. The Company funds the DB plans by contributing no less than the minimum amount required, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount allowed under US Internal Revenue Service regulations. The range of contributions determined under these regulations can vary significantly depending upon the funded status of the plans. At present, there is some flexibility in the amount that is contributed on an annual basis. In general, the Company's policy for funding the US pension plans is to contribute the amounts collected in rates and capitalised in the rate base during the year, to the extent that the funding is no less than the minimum amount required. For the current financial year, these contributions amounted to approximately \u00a3116 million (2021: \u00a3110 million).",

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued\n\n## US other post-retirement benefits\n\nNational Grid provides healthcare and life insurance benefits to eligible employees, post-retirement. Eligibility is based on certain age and length of service requirements and, in most cases, retirees contribute to the cost of their healthcare coverage. In the US, there is no governmental requirement to pre-fund post-retirement healthcare and life insurance plans. However, in general, the Company's policy for funding the US retiree healthcare and life insurance plans is to contribute amounts collected in rates and capitalised in the rate base during the year. For the current financial year, these contributions amounted to \u00a317 million (2021: \u00a326 million).\n\nFor the last few years it has been the Company's policy to primarily direct contributions to the DB pension plans due to concerns over tax deductible limitations relating to the retiree and healthcare and life insurance plans.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions\n\nOn retirement, members of DB plans receive benefits whose value is dependent on factors such as salary and length of pensionable service. National Grid's obligation in respect of DB pension plans is calculated separately for each DB plan by projecting the estimated amount of future benefit payments that employees have earned for their pensionable service in the current and prior periods. These future benefit payments are discounted to determine the present value of the liabilities. Current service cost and any unrecognised past service cost are recognised immediately.\n\nAdvice is taken from independent actuaries relating to the appropriateness of the key assumptions applied, including life expectancy, expected salary and pension increases, and inflation. Comparatively small changes in the assumptions used may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income and the net liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. Remeasurements of pension assets and post-retirement benefit obligations are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the consolidated statement of other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Company has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing DB liabilities:\n\n|                                          | UK pensions   | UK pensions   | UK pensions   | US pensions   | US pensions   | US pensions   | US other post-retirement benefits   | US other post-retirement benefits   | US other post-retirement benefits   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                                          | 2022 %        | 2021 %        | 2020 %        | 2022 %        | 2021 %        | 2020 %        | 2022 %                              | 2021 %                              | 2020 %                              |\n| Discount rate - past service             | 2.78          | 2.00          | 2.35          | 3.65          | 3.25          | 3.30          | 3.65                                | 3.25                                | 3.30                                |\n| Discount rate - future service           | 2.85          | 2.15          | 2.35          | 3.65          | 3.25          | 3.30          | 3.65                                | 3.25                                | 3.30                                |\n| Rate of increase in RPI - past service   | 3.60          | 3.15          | 2.65          | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a                                 | n/a                                 | n/a                                 |\n| Rate of increase in RPI - future service | 3.33          | 3.00          | 2.45          | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a                                 | n/a                                 | n/a                                 |\n| Salary increases                         | 3.47          | 3.40          | 2.90          | 4.60          | 4.30          | 3.50          | 4.60                                | 4.30                                | 3.50                                |\n| Initial healthcare cost trend rate       | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | 6.80                                | 7.10                                | 7.00                                |\n| Ultimate healthcare cost trend rate      | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | n/a           | 4.50                                | 4.50                                | 4.50                                |\n\nFor UK pensions, single equivalent financial assumptions are shown above for presentational purposes, although full yield curves have been used in our calculations. The discount rate is determined by reference to high-quality UK corporate bonds at the reporting date. The rate of increase in salaries has been set using a promotional scale where appropriate. The rates of increases stated are not indicative of historical increases awarded or a guarantee of future increase, but merely an appropriate assumption used in assessing DB liabilities. Retail Price Index (RPI) is the key assumption that determines assumed increases in pensions in payment and deferment in the UK only.\n\nDiscount rates for US pension liabilities have been determined by reference to appropriate yields on high-quality US corporate bonds at the reporting date based on the duration of plan liabilities. The healthcare cost trend rate is expected to reach the ultimate trend rate by 2031 (2021: 2030).\n\nThe table below sets out the projected life expectancies adopted for the UK and US pension arrangements:\n\n|                                                | UK pensions   | UK pensions   | UK pensions   | US pensions   | US pensions   | US pensions   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                | 2022 years    | 2021 years    | 2020 years    | 2022 years    | 2021 years    | 2020 years    |\n| Assumed life expectations for a retiree age 65 |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Males                                          | 22.0          | 21.8          | 22.1          | 21.4          | 21.6          | 20.9          |\n| Females                                        | 23.8          | 23.7          | 23.8          | 23.6          | 24.0          | 23.4          |\n| In 20 years:                                   |               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Males                                          | 23.2          | 23.1          | 23.3          | 23.1          | 23.2          | 22.5          |\n| Females                                        | 25.2          | 25.2          | 25.3          | 25.3          | 25.5          | 25.1          |\n\nThe weighted average duration of the DB obligation for each category of plan is 14 years for UK pension plans; 13 years for US pension plans and 15 years for US other post-retirement benefit plans.

Although the governing bodies have sole responsibility for setting investment strategies and managing risks, National Grid closely works with and supports the governing bodies of each plan, to assist them in mitigating the risks associated with their plans and to ensure that the plans are funded to meet their obligations.\n\nThe most significant risks associated with the DB plans are:\n\n| Main risks                     | Description and mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment risk                | The plans invest in a variety of asset classes, with actual returns likely to differ from the underlying discount rate adopted,  impacting on the funding position of the plan through the net balance sheet asset or liability. Each plan seeks to balance the  level of investment return required with the risk that it can afford to take, to design the most appropriate investment portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Changes in bond yields         | Liabilities are calculated using discount rates set with reference to the yields in high-quality bonds prevailing in the UK and  US debt markets and will fluctuate as yields change. Volatility of the net balance sheet asset or liability is controlled through  liability-matching strategies. The investment strategies allow for the use of synthetic as well as physical assets to be used to  hedge interest rate risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Inflation risk                 | Changes in inflation will affect the current and future pensions but are partially mitigated through investing in inflation- matching assets and hedging instruments as well as bulk annuity buy-in policies. The investment strategies allow for the use  of synthetic as well as physical assets to be used to hedge inflation risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Member longevity               | Longevity is a key driver of liabilities and changes in life expectancy have a direct impact on liabilities. Improvements in life  expectancy will lead to pension payments being paid for longer than expected and benefits ultimately being more expensive.  This risk has been partly mitigated by recent scheme investment transactions including a longevity insurance contract  (longevity swap) for NGEG of ESPS and two buy-in policies for Section A of NGUKPS.                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Counterparty risk Default risk | This is managed by having a diverse range of counterparties and through having a strong collateralisation process (including  for the longevity swap held by NGEG of ESPS). Measurement and management of counterparty risk is delegated to the  relevant investment managers. For our bulk annuity policies, various termination provisions were introduced in the contracts,  managing our exposure to counterparty risk. The insurers' operational performance and financial strength are monitored on  a regular basis. Investments are predominantly made in regulated markets in assets considered to be of investment grade. Where |\n|                                | investments are made either in non-investment grade assets or outside of regulated markets, investment levels are kept to  prudent levels and subject to agreed control ranges, to control the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Liquidity risk                 | The pension plans hold sufficient cash to meet benefit requirements, with other investments being held in liquid or realisable  assets to meet unexpected cash flow requirements. The plans do not borrow money, or act as guarantor, to provide liquidity  to other parties (unless it is temporary).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Currency risk                  | Fluctuations in the value of foreign denominated assets due to exposure to currency exchange rates is managed through a  combination of segregated currency hedging overlay and currency hedging carried out by some of the investment managers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |",

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued\n\n## DB plan investment strategies\n\nThe Trustees and RPC, after taking advice from professional investment advisors and in consultation with National Grid, set their key principles, including expected returns, risk and liquidity requirements. They formulate an investment strategy to manage risk through diversification, taking into account expected contributions, maturity of the pension liabilities, and in the UK, the strength of the covenant. These strategies allocate investments between return-seeking assets such as equities and property, and liability-matching assets such as buy-in policies, government securities and corporate bonds which are intended to protect the funding position.\n\nThe approximate investment allocations for our plans at 31 March 2022 are as follows:\n\n|                           |   UK pensions % |   US pensions % |   US other post- retirement benefits % |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Return-seeking assets     |              28 |              41 |                                     51 |\n| Liability-matching assets |              72 |              59 |                                     49 |\n\nThe governing bodies can generally delegate responsibility for the selection of specific bonds, securities and other investments to appointed investment managers. Investment managers are selected based on the required skills, expertise in those markets, process and financial security to manage the investments. Their performance is regularly reviewed against measurable objectives, consistent with each pension plan's long-term objectives and accepted risk levels.\n\nIn the UK, each of our pension plans has Responsible Investment (RI) Policies, which take into account Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors and generally incorporate the six UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI). Each of the Trustee boards believes that ESG factors can be material to financial outcomes and should therefore be considered alongside other factors. They recognise that their primary responsibility remains a fiduciary one, i.e., their first duty is to ensure the best possible return on investments with the appropriate level of risk. However, they also recognise the increasing materiality of ESG factors and that they have a fiduciary and regulatory duty to consider RI, including ESG factors and their potential impact on the quality and sustainability of long-term investment returns. The principle defined contribution arrangement in the UK, the NGUKRP, is operated by Legal & General, which embeds ESG factors in the investment options offered to members. As well as offering a range of self-select ethical funds, it directly incorporates its Climate Impact Pledge into the default investment option, which acts to align the fund to a carbon net zero future.\n\nWhilst in the US there is no regulatory requirement to have ESG-specific principles embedded in investment policies, our investment managers often utilise ESG principles to inform their decision-making process.",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when an obligation exists resulting from a past event, and it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it, but the exact amount of cash required can only be estimated. The majority of our provisions relate to environmental remediation, specifically in relation to certain Superfund sites in the US, being sites we own or have owned in the past where hazardous substances are present as a result of the historic operations of manufactured gas plants in Brooklyn, New York. We also recognise provisions for decommissioning costs for various assets we would be required to remove at the end of their lives; the costs associated with restructuring plans; the costs in respect of insured past events; for certain Ofgem arrangements in respect of specific interconnectors which require the return of excess revenues above a cap; and for lease contracts we have entered into that are now loss-making.\n\nIn determining the quantum of the provision we recognise, we make estimates in relation to management's best judgement of the evaluation of the likelihood and the probability of exposure to potential loss, and the costs that would be incurred. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, the likelihood or quantum could alter.\n\nProvisions are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the reporting date, as a result of a past event, where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated and where the outflow of economic benefit is probable.\n\nThe quantum of the provision recognised for decommissioning, environmental, restructuring and other costs is based on estimated future expenditure, discounted to present values. An initial estimate of decommissioning and environmental costs attributable to property, plant and equipment is recorded as part of the original cost of the related property, plant and equipment. Provisions to decommission significant portions of our regulated transmission and distribution assets are not recognised where no legal obligations exist, and a realistic alternative exists to incurring costs to decommission assets at the end of their life. In any case, even if a legal or constructive obligation did exist, it is not currently determinable when remediation work would take place and therefore no provision would be recorded at this point.\n\nChanges in the provision arising from revised estimates, discount rates or changes in the expected timing of expenditure that relates to property, plant and equipment are recorded as adjustments to their carrying value and depreciated prospectively over their remaining estimated useful economic lives; otherwise such changes are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe unwinding of the discount is included within the income statement within finance costs.\n\n|                                             | Environmental \u00a3m   | Decommissioning \u00a3m   | Restructuring \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total provisions \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------------------|\n| At 1 April 2020                             | 2,071              | 254                  | 35                 | 294        | 2,654                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | (185)              | (9)                  | (1)                | (21)       | (216)                 |\n| Additions                                   | 26                 | 42                   | 11                 | 67         | 146                   |\n| Unused amounts reversed                     | (38)               | (27)                 | -                  | (16)       | (81)                  |\n| Unwinding of discount                       | 66                 | 7                    | -                  | 5          | 78                    |\n| Utilised                                    | (161)              | (16)                 | (19)               | (62)       | (258)                 |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (79)               | (7)                  | -                  | (10)       | (96)                  |\n| At 31 March 2021                            | 1,700              | 244                  | 26                 | 257        | 2,227                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                        | 82                 | 4                    | 1                  | 10         | 97                    |\n| Additions                                   | 158                | 37                   | 16                 | 212        | 423                   |\n| Acquisition of WPD (note 37)                | -                  | 37                   | -                  | 29         | 66                    |\n| Unused amounts reversed                     | (25)               | (4)                  | (1)                | (31)       | (61)                  |\n| Unwinding of discount                       | 64                 | 6                    | -                  | 3          | 73                    |\n| Utilised                                    | (99)               | (26)                 | (22)               | (47)       | (194)                 |\n| Reclassification to held for sale (note 10) | (3)                | (40)                 | (3)                | (46)       | (92)                  |\n| At 31 March 2022                            | 1,877              | 258                  | 17                 | 387        | 2,539                 |\n\n|             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current     | 240       | 260       |\n| Non-current | 2,299     | 1,967     |\n|             | 2,539     | 2,227     |",

        "page_content": "## 26. Provisions continued\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe environmental provision represents the estimated restoration and remediation costs relating to a number of sites owned and managed by subsidiary undertakings, together with certain US sites that National Grid no longer owns. The environmental provision is as follows:\n\n|          | 2022          | 2022                  | 2022                 | 2021          | 2021                  | 2021                 |\n|----------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n|          | Discounted \u00a3m | Real  undiscounted \u00a3m | Real  discount  rate | Discounted \u00a3m | Real  undiscounted \u00a3m | Real  discount  rate |\n| UK sites | 152           | 160                   | 0.5 %                | 167           | 171                   | 0.5 %                |\n| US sites | 1,725         | 1,789                 | 0.5 %                | 1,533         | 1,583                 | 0.5 %                |\n|          | 1,877         | 1,949                 |                      | 1,700         | 1,754                 |                      |\n\nThe remediation expenditure in the UK relates to old gas manufacturing sites and also to electricity transmission sites. Cash flows are expected to be incurred until 2069. A number of estimation uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision, including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies, the expected timing and duration of cash flows, and changes in the real discount rate. This provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact the calculation of the provision. The undiscounted amount is the undiscounted best estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.\n\nThe remediation expenditure in the US is expected to be incurred until 2069, of which the majority relates to three Superfund sites (being sites where hazardous substances are present as a result of the historic operations of manufactured gas plants in Brooklyn, New York). The weighted average duration of the cash flows is 11 years. The uncertainties regarding the calculation of this provision are similar to those considered in respect of UK sites. Under the terms of our rate plans, we are entitled to recovery of environmental clean-up costs from rate payers.\n\n## Decommissioning provisions\n\nThe decommissioning provisions include \u00a3258 million (2021: \u00a3244 million) of expenditure relating to asset retirement obligations estimated to be incurred until 2104.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nIn 2022, we continued to undertake design and implementation activities in respect of our new operating model and cost efficiency programme, which resulted in the recognition of an increased provision of \u00a316 million in the year (2021: \u00a311 million). The income statement expense relating to the provision has been treated as an exceptional item, and details are provided in note 5.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nIncluded within other provisions at 31 March 2022 are the following amounts:\n\n- \u00b7  \u00a3163 million (2021: \u00a3166 million) of estimated liabilities in respect of past events insured by insurance subsidiary undertakings, including employer liability claims. In accordance with insurance industry practice, these estimates are based on experience from previous years, but we currently expect that cash flows will be incurred until 2037;\n- \u00b7 \u00a3121 million (2021: \u00a3nil) of estimated liabilities in respect of interconnector excess revenues which will be repayable in future reporting periods in accordance with the cap and floor regime constructed by Ofgem (see notes 3 and 38). These estimates are based on the respective interconnectors' performance against their cumulative caps and cash outflows will be required to settle these liabilities by the financial year ending 31 March 2028;\n- \u00b7  \u00a328 million (2021: \u00a327 million) in respect of onerous lease commitments and rates payable on surplus properties with expenditure expected to be incurred until 2039; and\n- \u00b7  \u00a326 million (2021: \u00a313 million) in respect of emissions provisions with expenditure expected to be incurred until 2023.",

Share capital\n\nOrdinary share capital represents the total number of shares issued which are publicly traded. We also disclose the number of treasury shares the Company holds, which are shares that the Company has bought itself, predominantly to actively manage scrip issuances and settle employee share option and reward plan liabilities.\n\nShare capital is accounted for as an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that includes a residual interest in the consolidated assets of the Company after deducting all its liabilities and is recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, with an amount equal to the nominal amount of the shares issued included in the share capital account and the balance recorded in the share premium account.\n\n|                                              | Allotted, called-up and fully paid   | Allotted, called-up and fully paid   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                                              | million                              | \u00a3m                                   |\n| At 1 April 2020                              | 3,780                                | 470                                  |\n| Issued during the year in lieu of dividends\u00b9 | 35                                   | 4                                    |\n| At 31 March 2021                             | 3,815                                | 474                                  |\n| Issued during the year in lieu of dividends\u00b9 | 89                                   | 11                                   |\n| At 31 March 2022                             | 3,904                                | 485                                  |\n\nThe share capital of the Company consists of ordinary shares of 12 204 /473 pence nominal value each including ADSs. The ordinary shares and ADSs allow holders to receive dividends and vote at general meetings of the Company. The Company holds treasury shares but may not exercise any rights over these shares including the entitlement to vote or receive dividends. There are no restrictions on the transfer or sale of ordinary shares.\n\nIn line with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has amended its Articles of Association and ceased to have authorised share capital.\n\nThe Company has implemented a share forfeiture programme following the completion of a tracing and notification exercise to any shareholders who have not had contact with the Company over the past 12 years, in accordance with the provisions set out in the Company's Articles of Association. Under the share forfeiture programme, the shares and dividends associated with shares of untraced members have been forfeited, with the resulting proceeds transferred to the Company to use in line with the Company's corporate responsibility strategy. During the financial year, the Company received \u00a316 million of proceeds from the sale of untraced shares and derecognised \u00a332 million of liabilities related to unclaimed dividends, which are reflected in share premium and the income statement respectively.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Company held 259 million (2021: 266 million) of its own shares. The market value of these shares as at 31 March 2022 was \u00a33,038 million (2021: \u00a32,296 million).\n\nFor the benefit of employees and in connection with the operation of the Company's various share plans, the Company made the following transactions in respect of its own shares during the year ended 31 March 2022:\n\n- i.  During the year, 4 million (2021: 4 million) treasury shares were gifted to National Grid Employee Share Trusts and 2 million (2021: 2 million) treasury shares were re-issued in relation to employee share schemes, in total representing approximately 0.2% (2021: 0.2%) of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 March 2022. The nominal value of these shares was \u00a31 million (2021: \u00a31 million) and the total proceeds received were \u00a317 million (2021: \u00a317 million). National Grid settles share awards under its Long Term Incentive Plan and the Save As You Earn scheme, by the transfer of treasury shares to its employee share trusts.\n- ii.  During the year, the Company made payments totalling \u00a33 million (2021: \u00a32 million) to National Grid Employee Share Trusts to enable the Trustees to make purchases of National Grid plc shares to settle share awards in relation to all employee share plans and discretionary reward plans. The cost of such purchases is deducted from retained earnings in the period that the transaction occurs.\n\nThe maximum number of ordinary shares held in treasury during the year was 266 million (2021: 272 million) representing approximately 6.8% (2021: 7.1%) of the ordinary shares in issue as at 31 March 2022 and having a nominal value of \u00a333 million (2021: \u00a334 million).",

        "page_content": "## 28. Other equity reserves\n\nOther equity reserves are different categories of equity as required by accounting standards and represent the impact of a number of our historical transactions or fair value movements on certain financial instruments that the Company holds.\n\nOther equity reserves comprise the translation reserve (see accounting policy C in note 1), cash flow hedge reserve and the cost of hedging reserve (see note 32), debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income reserve (FVOCI debt) and equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income reserve (FVOCI equity) (see note 15), the capital redemption reserve and the merger reserve.\n\nThe merger reserve arose as a result of the application of merger accounting principles under the then prevailing UK GAAP, which under IFRS 1 was retained for mergers that occurred prior to the IFRS transition date. Under merger accounting principles, the difference between the carrying amount of the capital structure of the acquiring vehicle and that of the acquired business was treated as a merger difference and included within reserves. The merger reserve represents the difference between the carrying value of subsidiary undertaking investments and their respective capital structures following the Lattice demerger from BG Group plc and the 1999 Lattice refinancing.\n\nThe cash flow hedge reserve will amortise as the committed future cash flows from borrowings are paid or capitalised in fixed assets (as described in note 32). Cost of hedging, FVOCI debt and FVOCI equity reserves arose as a result of the adoption of IFRS 9 on 1 April 2018. See note 15 for further detail on FVOCI debt and FVOCI equity reserves; and note 32 in respect of cost of hedging reserve.\n\nAs the amounts included in other equity reserves are not attributable to any of the other classes of equity presented, they have been disclosed as a separate classification of equity.\n\n|                                                                                  | Translation \u00a3m   | Cash flow  hedge \u00a3m   | Cost of  hedging \u00a3m   | FVOCI  equity \u00a3m   | FVOCI  debt  \u00a3m   | Own  credit  \u00a3m   | Capital redemption \u00a3m   | Merger \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2019                                                                  | 750              | 61                    | 17                    | 34                 | 48                | 13                | 19                      | (5,165)     | (4,223)    |\n| Exchange adjustments\u00b9                                                            | 560              | -

As a result we have separately disclosed the reconciliation below, excluding derivatives associated with our net investment hedges and derivatives associated with the hedging of capital expenditure, given that they are both classified in the consolidated cash flow statement within investing activities.\n\n|                                    | Notes   | Borrowings \u00a3m   | Financing  derivatives \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2019                    |         | (28,730)        | 228                         | (28,502)   |\n| Impact of transition to IFRS 16    |         | (474)           | -                           | (474)      |\n| Cash flow\u00b9                         |         | 450             | 240                         | 690        |\n| Fair value gains and losses        |         | (57)            | (231)                       | (288)      |\n| Foreign exchange movements         |         | (807)           | -                           | (807)      |\n| Interest charges                   | 6       | (1,092)         | (9)                         | (1,101)    |\n| Other non-cash movements           |         | (84)            | -                           | (84)       |\n| At 1 April 2020                    |         | (30,794)        | 228                         | (30,566)   |\n| Cash flow\u00b9                         |         | (2,336)         | 158                         | (2,178)    |\n| Fair value gains and losses        |         | 159             | (301)                       | (142)      |\n| Foreign exchange movements         |         | 1,710           | -                           | 1,710      |\n| Interest charges                   | 6       | (946)           | 11                          | (935)      |\n| Other non-cash movements           |         | (136)           | -                           | (136)      |\n| Reclassification to held for sale  | 10      | 1,123           | -                           | 1,123      |\n| At 1 April 2021                    |         | (31,220)        | 96                          | (31,124)   |\n| Cash flow                          |         | (9,993)         | 149                         | (9,844)    |\n| Fair value gains and losses        |         | 286             | (472)                       | (186)      |\n| Foreign exchange movements         |         | (652)           | -                           | (652)      |\n| Interest charges                   | 6       | (1,177)         | (54)                        | (1,231)    |\n| Other non-cash movements           |         | 34              | -                           | 34         |\n| Acquisition of WPD                 | 37      | (8,286)         | 26                          | (8,260)    |\n| Reclassification to held for sale\u00b2 | 10      | 5,543           | (495)                       | 5,048      |\n| At 31 March 2022                   |         | (45,465)        | (750)                       | (46,215)   |",

We do not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nIn September 2021, a fire at the IFA interconnector station in Sellindge, Kent caused significant damage to infrastructure on site. This incident has resulted in claims under the Group's insurance policy for the rebuild cost of the damaged property and lost revenue arising from the business interruption. The Group believes that a favourable outcome is probable. However, the contingent asset has not been recognised as a receivable at 31 March 2022 because receipt of the amount is dependent on the outcome of the reinsurers formally agreeing liability and signing off on the investigation report. As at 31 March 2022, the investigation report is with the reinsurers for review and the final amount and timing of any insurance proceeds is not known with certainty.\n\nThe exceptional environmental insurance recovery described in note 5 is the result of one of a number of legal proceedings that are ongoing between the Group and insurance companies who have provided historic cover over sites which were environmentally impacted in the past. Following the resolution of that claim, the Group has reassessed the likelihood of recovery in other similar legal proceedings and now believes that it is more likely than not that one or more of them will be successful. However, legal proceedings in each case still have a number of stages to complete, including in certain cases court proceedings.",

Financial risk management\n\nOur activities expose us to a variety of financial risks including credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, currency risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and commodity price risk. Our risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential volatility of financial performance from these risks. We use financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, to manage these risks.\n\nRisk management related to financing activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Finance Committee of the Board. The objective of the treasury department is to manage funding and liquidity requirements, including managing associated financial risks, to within acceptable boundaries. The Finance Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, and written policies covering the following specific areas: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity. The Finance Committee has delegated authority to administer the commodity price risk policy and credit policy for US -based commodity transactions to the Energy Procurement Risk Management Committee and the National Grid USA Board of Directors. Details of key activities in the current year are set out in the Finance Committee report on page 107.\n\nWe have exposure to the following risks, which are described in more detail below:\n\n- \u00b7  credit risk;\n- \u00b7  liquidity risk;\n- \u00b7  currency risk;\n- \u00b7  interest rate risk;\n- \u00b7  commodity price risk; and\n- \u00b7  capital risk.\n\nWhere appropriate, derivatives and other financial instruments used for hedging currency and interest rate risk exposures are formally designated as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges as defined in IFRS 9. Hedge accounting allows the timing of the profit or loss impact of qualifying hedging instruments to be recognised in the same reporting period as the corresponding impact of hedged exposures. To qualify for hedge accounting, documentation is prepared specifying the risk management objective and strategy, the component transactions and methodology used for measurement of effectiveness.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 32. Financial risk management continued\n\nHedge accounting relationships are designated in line with risk management activities further described below. The categories of hedging entered into are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  currency risk arising from our forecasted foreign currency transactions (capital expenditure or revenues) is designated in cash flow hedges;\n- \u00b7  currency risk arising from our net investments in foreign operations is designated in net investment hedges; and\n- \u00b7  currency and interest rate risk arising from borrowings are designated in cash flow or fair value hedges.\n\nCritical terms of hedging instruments and hedged items are transacted to match on a 1:1 ratio by notional values. Hedge ineffectiveness can nonetheless arise from inherent differences between derivatives and non-derivative instruments and other market factors including credit, correlations, supply and demand, and market volatilities. Ineffectiveness is recognised in the remeasurements component of finance income and costs (see note 6). Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nCertain hedging instrument components are treated separately as costs of hedging with the gains and losses deferred in a component of other equity reserves and released systematically into profit or loss to correspond with the timing and impact of hedged exposures, or released in full to finance costs upon an early discontinuation of a hedging relationship.\n\nRefer to sections (c) currency risk and (d) interest rate risk below for further details on hedge accounting.\n\n## (a) Credit risk\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a contract. This risk is inherent in our commercial business activities. Exposure arises from derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, trade receivables and committed transactions with wholesale and retail customers.\n\n## Treasury credit risk\n\nCounterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative financial instruments. As at 31 March 2022, the following limits were in place for investments and derivative financial instruments held with banks and financial institutions:\n\n|                                                                   | Maximum limit \u00a3m   | Long-term limit \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n| Triple 'A' G7 sovereign entities (AAA)                            | 2,708              | 2,031                |\n| Triple 'A' vehicles (AAA)                                         | 500                | -                    |\n| Triple 'A' range institutions and non-G7 sovereign entities (AAA) | 2,462              | 1,847                |\n| Double 'A+' G7 sovereign entities (AA+)                           | 2,462              | 1,847                |\n| Double 'A' range institutions (AA)                                | 1,477 to 1,970     | 1,108 to 1,477       |\n| Single 'A' range institutions (A)                                 | 492 to 985         | 369 to 739           |\n\nThe maximum limit applies to all transactions, including long-term transactions. The long-term limit applies to transactions which mature in more than 12 months' time.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022 and 2021, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties. In accordance with our treasury policies, counterparty credit exposure utilisations are monitored daily against the counterparty credit limits. Counterparty credit ratings and market conditions are reviewed continually with limits being revised and utilisation adjusted, if appropriate. Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties. Further information on financial investments subject to impairment provisioning is included in note 15.\n\n## Commodity credit risk\n\nThe credit policy for US-based commodity transactions is owned by the Finance Committee to the Board, which establishes controls and procedures to determine, monitor and minimise the credit exposure to counterparties.\n\n## Wholesale and retail credit risk\n\nOur principal commercial exposure in the UK is governed by the credit rules within the regulated codes: Uniform Network Code and Connection and Use of System Code. These set out the level of credit relative to the RAV for each credit rating. In the US, we are required to supply electricity and gas under state regulations. Our policies and practices are designed to limit credit exposure by collecting security deposits prior to providing utility services, or after utility services have commenced if certain applicable regulatory requirements are met. Collection activities are managed on a daily basis. Sales to retail customers are usually settled in cash, cheques, electronic bank payments or by using major credit cards. We are committed to measuring, monitoring, minimising and recording counterparty credit risk in our wholesale business. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored, and collateral is collected against these accounts when necessary.\n\nIn March 2020, the Group's US distribution business temporarily ceased certain cash collection and termination activities in response to regulatory instructions following the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time this resulted in the recognition of expected credit losses. In the year ended 31 March 2022, collection activities resumed in New England and New York and are supported by certain government COVID funding programmes, which has been factored into the assessment of expected credit losses for the year (see note 19 for further details).",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (a) Credit risk continued\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe following tables set out our financial assets and liabilities which are subject to offset and to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. The tables show the amounts which are offset and reported net in the statement of financial position. Amounts which cannot be offset under IFRS, but which could be settled net under terms of master netting arrangements if certain conditions arise, and with collateral received or pledged, are shown to present National Grid's net exposure.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities on different transactions would only be reported net in the balance sheet if the transactions were with the same counterparty, a currently enforceable legal right of offset exists, and the cash flows were intended to be settled on a net basis.\n\nAmounts which do not meet the criteria for offsetting on the statement of financial position, but could be settled net in certain circumstances, principally relate to derivative transactions under ISDA agreements, where each party has the option to settle amounts on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.\n\nCommodity contract derivatives that have not been offset on the balance sheet may be settled net in certain circumstances under ISDA or North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) agreements.\n\nFor bank account balances and bank overdrafts, there are no 'Gross amounts offset' under cash pooling arrangements (2021: \u00a3nil). Our UK bank accounts for National Grid subsidiaries previously participated in GBP, EUR and USD Composite Accounting System overdraft facilities subject to offsetting gross and net overdraft limits. EUR and USD offsetting arrangements were discontinued in the prior year and GBP offsetting arrangements have no impact as at 31 March 2022. In the US, no offsetting arrangements exist, and cash transactions are settled through Service Company bank accounts with subsequent intercompany payables and receivables reported by subsidiaries with the Service Company.\n\nThe gross amounts offset for trade payables and receivables, which are subject to general terms and conditions, are insignificant.\n\n|                                |                           |                         |                                                            | Related amounts available to be offset but  not offset in statement  of financial position   | Related amounts available to be offset but  not offset in statement  of financial position   |               |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| At 31 March 2022               | Gross carrying amounts \u00a3m | Gross amounts offset \u00a3m | Net amount presented in statement of financial position \u00a3m | Financial  instruments \u00a3m                                                                    | Cash collateral received/ pledged \u00a3m                                                         | Net amount \u00a3m |\n| Assets                         |                           |                         |                                                            |                                                                                              |                                                                                              |               |\n| Financing derivatives          | 298                       | -

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (c) Currency risk\n\nNational Grid operates internationally with mainly pound sterling as the functional currency for the UK companies and US dollar for the US businesses. Currency risk arises from three major areas: funding activities, capital investment and related revenues, and holdings in foreign operations. This risk is managed using financial instruments including derivatives as approved by policy, typically cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign exchange swaps and forwards.\n\nFunding activities - our policy is to borrow in the most advantageous market available. Foreign currency funding gives rise to risk of volatility in the amount of functional currency cash to be repaid. This risk is reduced by swapping principal and interest back into the functional currency of the issuer. All foreign currency debt and transactions are hedged except where they provide a natural offset to assets elsewhere in the Group.\n\nCapital investment and related revenues - capital projects often incur costs or generate revenues in a foreign currency, most often euro transactions done by the UK business. Our policy for managing foreign exchange transaction risk is to hedge contractually committed foreign currency cash flows over a prescribed minimum size, typically by buying euro forwards to hedge future expenditure, and selling euro forwards to hedge future revenues. For hedges of forecast cash flows our policy is to hedge a proportion of highly probable cash flows.\n\nHoldings in foreign operations - we are exposed to fluctuations on the translation into pounds sterling of our foreign operations. The policy for managing this translation risk is to issue foreign currency debt or to replicate foreign debt using derivatives that pay cash flows in the currency of the foreign operation.

We do not have any other significant exposure to currency risk on these balances.\n\n## Hedge accounting for currency risk\n\nWhere available, derivatives transacted for hedging are designated for hedge accounting. Economic offset is qualitatively determined because the critical terms (currency and volume) of the hedging instrument match the hedged exposure. If a forecast transaction was no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity would be transferred to the income statement. This has not occurred in the current or comparative years.\n\nCash flow hedging of currency risk of capital expenditure and revenues is designated as hedging the exposure to movements in the spot translation rates only. The timing of forecasted transactions is not designated as a hedged risk. Gains and losses on hedging instruments arising from forward points and foreign currency basis spreads are excluded from designation and are recognised immediately in profit or loss, along with any hedge ineffectiveness. On recognition of the hedged purchase or sale in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses, deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve in other equity reserves, are transferred out of reserves and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction. Where a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability results from a forecast transaction or firm commitment being hedged, the amounts deferred in reserves are included directly in the initial measurement of that asset or liability.\n\nNet investment hedging is also designated as hedging the exposure to movements in spot translation rates only: spot-related gains and losses on hedging instruments are presented in the cumulative translation reserve within other equity reserves to offset gains or losses on translation of the hedged balance sheet exposure. Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts deferred in the cumulative translation reserve with respect to net investment hedges are subsequently recognised in the income statement in the event of disposal of the overseas operations concerned. Any remaining amounts deferred in the cost of hedging reserve are also released to the income statement.\n\nHedges of foreign currency funding are designated as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges of forward exchange risk (hedging both currency and interest rate risk together, where applicable). Gains and losses arising from foreign currency basis spreads are excluded from designation and are treated as a cost of hedging, deferred initially in other equity reserves and released into profit or loss over the life of the hedging relationship. Hedge accounting for funding is described further in the interest rate risk section below.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (d) Interest rate risk\n\nNational Grid's interest rate risk arises from our long-term borrowings. Our interest rate risk management policy is to seek to minimise total financing costs (being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt). Hedging instruments principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to translate foreign currency debt into functional currency and to adjust the proportion of fixed-rate and floating-rate in the borrowings portfolio to within a range set by the Finance Committee of the Board. The benchmark interest rates hedged are currently based on LIBOR for USD and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) for GBP.\n\nLIBOR is being replaced as an interest rate benchmark by alternative reference rates in certain currencies including our functional currencies, USD and GBP, and foreign currencies in which we operate. This impacts contracts including financial liabilities that pay LIBOR-based cash flows, and derivatives that receive or pay LIBOR-based cash flows. The change in benchmark also affects discount rates which will impact the valuations of certain liabilities. We have disclosed our exposure to LIBOR on our derivative portfolio in note 17, on our borrowings in note 21 and on our hedging arrangements in note 32(e). We are managing the risk by transitioning LIBOR cash flows to alternative reference rates on our affected contracts in line with the relevant jurisdictions. The migration project is underway, with all affected contracts where we previously paid or received GBP LIBOR amended in the year to 31 March 2022 (see note 21). The Finance Committee of the Board have delegated to the treasury department the authority to determine which benchmarks are the most appropriate. A combination of LIBOR and the successor benchmarks, primarily GBP SONIA and USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) will be used in the portfolio during the migration period.\n\nWe also consider inflation risk and hold some inflation-linked borrowings. We believe that these provide a partial economic offset to the inflation risk associated with our UK inflation-linked revenues.\n\nThe table in note 21 sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps.\n\nNet debt was managed using derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows:\n\n|                           | 2022          | 2022             | 2022                | 2022       | 2022     | 2021          | 2021             | 2021                | 2021       | 2021     |\n|---------------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|\n|                           | Fixed rate \u00a3m | Floating rate \u00a3m | Inflation linked \u00a3m | Other 1 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Fixed rate \u00a3m | Floating rate \u00a3m | Inflation linked \u00a3m | Other 1 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 82            | 118              | -                   | 4          | 204      | 64            | 67               | -                   | 26         | 157      |\n| Financial investments     | -             | 3,107            | -                   | 38         | 3,145    | -             | 2,309            | -                   | 33         | 2,342    |\n| Borrowings                | (30,616)      | (10,484)         | (4,365)             | -          | (45,465) | (23,163)      | (1,762)          | (6,295)             | -          | (31,220) |\n| Pre-derivative position   | (30,534)      | (7,259)          | (4,365)             | 42         | (42,116) | (23,099)      | 614              | (6,295)             | 59         | (28,721) |\n| Derivative effect         | 2,860         | (3,366)          | (187)               | -          | (693)    | 2,869         | (2,511)          | (183)               | -          | 175      |\n| Net debt position         | (27,674)      | (10,625)         | (4,552)             | 42         | (42,809) | (20,230)      | (1,897)          | (6,478)             | 59         | (28,546) |\n\n## Hedge accounting for interest rate risk\n\nBorrowings paying variable or floating-rates expose National Grid to cash flow interest rate risk, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Where a hedging instrument results in paying a fixed-rate, it is designated as a cash flow hedge because it has reduced the cash flow volatility of the hedged borrowing. Changes in the fair value of the derivative are initially recognised in other comprehensive income as gains or losses in the cash flow hedge reserve, with any ineffective portion recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nBorrowings paying fixed-rates expose National Grid to fair value interest rate risk. Where the hedging instrument pays a floating-rate, it is designated as a fair value hedge because it has reduced the fair value volatility of the borrowing. Changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being hedged are both adjusted on the balance sheet and offset in the income statement to the extent the fair value hedge is effective, with the residual difference remaining as ineffectiveness.\n\nBoth types of hedges are designated as hedging the currency and interest rate risk arising from changes in forward points. Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve (cash flow hedges only) and the deferred cost of hedging reserve (both cash flow and fair value hedges) are reclassified from reserves to the income statement on a systematic basis as hedged interest expense is recognised. Adjustments made to the carrying value of hedged items in fair value hedges are similarly released to the income statement to match the timing of the hedged interest expense.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued, any remaining cumulative hedge accounting balances continue to be released to the income statement to match the impact of outstanding hedged items. Any remaining amounts deferred in the cost of hedging reserve are released immediately to the income statement as finance costs.\n\nThe Group early-adopted Phase I of IFRS Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments related to hedge accounting with effect from 1 April 2019, and Phase II with effect from 1 April 2020. The amendments impact our fair value hedging relationships where derivative cash flows will have been transitioned from paying LIBOR to paying an alternative reference rate. The hedged risk must be re-documented to reflect this, and allow existing hedge designations to continue unchanged during the period of uncertainty relating to the timing and method of benchmark migrations. This process has been completed for sterling LIBOR contracts but remains in progress for US dollar contracts.\n\nThe amendments will be applied until the earliest point in time of the Group's contracts that reference LIBOR being amended, the hedging relationship being formally discontinued or formal market conventions ending uncertainty being published and widely adopted. If amended cash flows do not cause a hedging relationship to be discontinued, then the amendments will cease to be applied only when that relationship is discontinued under IFRS 9.\n\nThe IFRS amendments impact fair value and cash flow hedges of interest rate risk and related hedging instruments, and certain net investment hedges that use cross-currency interest rate swaps to pay a foreign currency floating rate and receive a functional currency floating rate. The notional values of hedging instruments, for each type of hedging relationship impacted, are shown in the hedge accounting tables in note 32(e). These amounts also correspond to the exposures designated as hedged.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (f) Commodity price risk\n\nWe purchase electricity and gas to supply our customers in the US and to meet our own energy needs. Substantially all our costs of purchasing electricity and gas for supply to customers are recoverable at an amount equal to cost. The timing of recovery of these costs can vary between financial periods leading to an under- or over-recovery within any particular year that can lead to large fluctuations in the income statement. We follow approved policies to manage price and supply risks for our commodity activities.\n\nOur energy procurement risk management policy and delegations of authority govern our US commodity trading activities for energy transactions. The purpose of this policy is to ensure we transact within pre-defined risk parameters and only in the physical and financial markets where we or our customers have a physical market requirement. In addition, state regulators require National Grid to manage commodity risk and cost volatility prudently through diversified pricing strategies. In some jurisdictions we are required to file a plan outlining our strategy to be approved by regulators. In certain cases, we might receive guidance with regard to specific hedging limits.\n\nEnergy purchase contracts for the forward purchase of electricity or gas that are used to satisfy physical delivery requirements to customers, or for energy that the Group uses itself, meet the expected purchase or usage requirements of IFRS 9. They are, therefore, not recognised in the financial statements until they are realised. Disclosure of commitments under such contracts is made in note 30.\n\nUS states have introduced a variety of legislative requirements with the aim of increasing the proportion of our electricity that is derived from renewable or other forms of clean energy. Annual compliance filings regarding the level of Renewable Energy Certificates (and other similar environmental certificates) are required by the relevant department of utilities. In response to the legislative requirements, National Grid has entered into long-term, typically fixedprice, energy supply contracts to purchase both renewable energy and environmental certificates. We are entitled to recover all costs incurred under these contracts through customer billing.\n\nUnder IFRS, where these supply contracts are not accounted for as leases, they are considered to comprise two components, being a forward purchase of power at spot prices, and a forward purchase of environmental certificates at a variable price (being the contract price less the spot power price). With respect to our current contracts, neither of these components meets the requirement to be accounted for as a derivative. The environmental certificates are currently required for compliance purposes, and at present there are no liquid markets for these attributes. Accordingly, this component meets the expected purchase or usage exemption of IFRS 9. We expect to enter into an increasing number of these contracts, in order to meet our compliance requirements in the short to medium term. In future, if and when liquid markets develop, and to the extent that we are in receipt of environmental certificates in excess of our required levels, this exemption may cease to apply, and we may be required to account for forward purchase commitments for environmental certificates as derivatives at fair value through profit and loss.",

Alternatively, they are valued using models where all significant inputs are based directly or indirectly on observable market data.\n\nOur Level 2 financing derivatives include cross-currency, interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives. We value these by discounting all future cash flows by externally sourced market yield curves at the reporting date, taking into account the credit quality of both parties. These derivatives can be priced using liquidly traded interest rate curves and foreign exchange rates, and therefore we classify our vanilla trades as Level 2 under the IFRS 13 framework.\n\nOur Level 2 commodity contract derivatives include over-the-counter gas and power swaps as well as forward physical gas deals. We value our contracts based on market data obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) where monthly prices are available. We discount based on externally sourced market yield curves at the reporting date, taking into account the credit quality of both parties and liquidity in the market. Our commodity contracts can be priced using liquidly traded swaps. Therefore, we classify our vanilla trades as Level 2 under the IFRS 13 framework.\n\nOur Level 3 financing derivatives include inflation-linked swaps, where the market is illiquid. In valuing these instruments, we use in-house valuation models and obtain external valuations to support each reported fair value.\n\nOur Level 3 commodity contract derivatives primarily consist of our forward purchases of electricity and gas that we value using proprietary models. Derivatives are classified as Level 3 where significant inputs into the valuation technique are neither directly nor indirectly observable (including our own data, which are adjusted, if necessary, to reflect the assumptions market participants would use in the circumstances).\n\nOur Level 3 investments include equity instruments accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. These equity holdings are part of our corporate venture capital portfolio held by National Grid Partners and comprise a series of small unquoted investments where prices or valuation inputs are unobservable. These investments are either recently acquired or there have been recent funding rounds with third parties and therefore the valuation is based on the latest transaction price and any subsequent investment-specific adjustments.\n\nOur Level 3 investments also include our investment in Sunrun Neptune 2016 LLC, which is accounted for at fair value through profit and loss. The investment is fair valued by discounting expected cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital specific to Sunrun Neptune 2016 LLC.\n\nIn light of the current ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the valuations of certain assets and liabilities can be more subjective. While there have been significant movements in market indices, we are satisfied that there has been no significant impact on the fair values of our financial instruments measured at fair value, and that any impact is reflected in the fair values in the table above.",

        "page_content": "## 32. Financial risk management continued\n\n## (h) Capital risk management\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders' equity, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity, and net debt (note 29). National Grid's objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard our ability to continue as a going concern; to remain within regulatory constraints of our regulated operating companies; and to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity funding thus achieving an optimal capital structure and cost of capital. We regularly review and manage the capital structure as appropriate in order to achieve these objectives.\n\nMaintaining appropriate credit ratings for our operating and holding companies is an important aspect of our capital risk management strategy and balance sheet efficiency. We monitor our balance sheet efficiency using several metrics including retained cash flow/net debt (RCF/debt), regulatory gearing and interest cover. For the year ended 31 March 2022, these metrics for the Group were 8.9% (2021: 6.6%), 81% (2021: 65%) and 4.7x (2021: 4.5x), respectively - see pages 37 and 273 - 274. As expected, regulatory gearing at 31 March 2022 was higher than our long-run projections due to the fact that we are only part way through the transactions that make up our strategic pivot. Once the strategic pivot is complete, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flows and for regulatory gearing to decrease and to settle at slightly above 70%. As a result, and combined with the benefit of our hybrid debt, we expect gearing levels, and the other standard metrics we monitor, to be consistent with our current, strong investment grade, overall Group credit rating.\n\nWe monitor the RAV gearing within National Grid Electricity Transmission plc (NGET), WPD and the regulated transmission business within National Grid Gas plc (NGG) which became a discontinued operation in the period (see note 10). This is calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of RAV, and indicates the level of debt employed to fund our UK regulated businesses. It is compared with the level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses, at around 55% to 65%. We also monitor net debt as a percentage of rate base for our US operating companies, comparing this with the allowed rate base gearing inherent within each of our agreed rate plans, typically around 50%.\n\nAs part of the Group's debt financing arrangements, we are subject to a number of financial covenants associated with existing borrowings and facility arrangements:\n\n- \u00b7 the requirement to maintain subsidiary indebtedness relating to non-US and US subsidiaries (excluding National Grid North America Inc.) limiting the total indebtedness in absolute terms to \u00a335 billion for non-US Subsidiaries and $35 billion for US subsidiaries. As at 31 March 2022, headroom on these covenants exceeds \u00a310 billion;\n- \u00b7 The Articles of Association of National Grid plc limit Group total borrowings less cash and short-term investments in absolute terms to \u00a355 billion. As at 31 March 2022 headroom on the limit exceeds \u00a310 billion;\n- \u00b7 Interest cover ratios relating to the WPD companies within the Group requiring a consolidated EBITDA to interest payable of not less than 3:1. These covenants range in outturn from 5:1 to 6:1 at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 Net debt to RAV gearing covenants limiting gearing to 85% of RAV for each WPD operating company. As at 31 March 2022, actual gearing of less than 60% is reported for all impacted companies.\n\nWe consider the risk of breaching these covenants as remote given the level of headroom present.\n\nThe majority of our regulated operating companies in the US and the UK are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by administrative order, contract and/or licence. The types of restrictions that a company may have that would prevent a dividend being declared or paid unless they are met include:\n\n- \u00b7  the requirement to notify by certification to regulators and certain lenders;\n- \u00b7  dividends must be approved in advance by the relevant US state regulatory commission;\n- \u00b7  the subsidiary must have one or two recognised rating agency credit ratings of at least investment grade depending on contractual requirements;\n- \u00b7  dividends must be limited to cumulative retained earnings, including pre-acquisition retained earnings and in line with relevant company legislation;\n- \u00b7  the securities of National Grid plc must maintain an investment grade credit rating, and if that rating is the lowest investment grade bond rating it cannot have a negative watch/review for downgrade notice by a credit rating agency;\n- \u00b7  the subsidiary must not carry out any activities other than those permitted by the licences;\n- \u00b7  the subsidiary must not create any cross-default obligations or give or receive any intra-group cross-subsidies;\n- \u00b7  the percentage of equity compared with total capital of the subsidiary must remain above certain levels; and\n- \u00b7  in the case of WPD, the percentage of debt compared with total RAV of the subsidiary must remain below 85%.\n\nThese restrictions are subject to alteration in the US as and when a new rate case or rate plan is agreed with the relevant regulatory bodies for each operating company and, in the UK, through the normal licence review process.\n\nAs most of our business is regulated, at 31 March 2022 the majority of our net assets are subject to some of the restrictions noted above. These restrictions are not considered to be significantly onerous, nor do we currently expect they will prevent the planned payment of dividends in future in line with our dividend policy.\n\nAll the above requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance. The Group has complied with all externally imposed capital requirements to which it is subject.",

The increase in total facility positions reflects the increased size of the Group following the acquisition of WPD. \u00a3845 million of the undrawn syndicated facilities due to mature in one to two years were renegotiated between 1 April and 19 May 2022, with no uplift in the amount and a new expiry date of May 2025.\n\nIncluded in the table above within three to four years is a facility of \u00a3350 million related to National Grid Gas plc, a company treated as held for sale.\n\nIn addition, we have the following facilities which are not included in the table above:\n\n- \u00b7 for the separately regulated business of National Grid Electricity System Operator Limited, the Group has a facility of \u00a3550 million (2021: \u00a3550 million). This facility is not available as Group general liquidity support;\n- \u00b7 the Group continues to have access to Export Credit Agreements (ECAs) funding specific projects totalling \u00a31,396 million (2021: \u00a31,345 million), of which \u00a3489 million (2021: \u00a3446 million) is undrawn; and\n- \u00b7 the Group entered into a loan facility in relation to the acquisition of WPD (see note 37) of \u00a38,250 million (31 March 2021: \u00a38,250 million) to finance the consideration, of which \u00a38,179 million has been drawn since the year end with no further drawdown available (31 March 2021: undrawn). The bridge facility allows for the extension of the facility maturity date up to September 2023 but includes a requirement that the proceeds of the planned sales of NECO and the UK Gas Transmission business are applied to repay the facility.",

Subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates\n\nWhile we present consolidated results in these financial statements as if we were one company, our legal structure is such that there are a number of different operating and holding companies that contribute to the overall result. This structure has evolved through acquisitions as well as regulatory requirements to have certain activities within separate legal entities.\n\n## Subsidiary undertakings\n\nA list of the Group's subsidiaries as at 31 March 2022 is given below. The entire share capital of subsidiaries is held within the Group except where the Group's ownership percentages are shown. These percentages give the Group's ultimate interest and therefore allow for the situation where subsidiaries are owned by partly owned intermediate subsidiaries. Where subsidiaries have different classes of shares, this is largely for historical reasons, and the effective percentage holdings given represent both the Group's voting rights and equity holding. Shares in National Grid (US) Holdings Limited, National Grid (US) Investments 2 Limited, National Grid Hong Kong Limited, National Grid Luxembourg SARL and NGG Finance plc are held directly by National Grid plc. All other holdings in subsidiaries are owned by other subsidiaries within the Group. All subsidiaries are consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\nPrincipal Group companies are identified in bold .

Sensitivities\n\nIn order to give a clearer picture of the impact on our results or financial position of potential changes in significant estimates and assumptions, the following sensitivities are presented. These sensitivities are based on assumptions and conditions prevailing at the year end and should be used with caution. The effects provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual effects that would be experienced because our actual exposures are constantly changing.\n\nThe sensitivities in the tables below show the potential impact in the income statement (and consequential impact on net assets) for a reasonably possible range of different variables each of which have been considered in isolation (i.e. with all other variables remaining constant). There are a number of these sensitivities which are mutually exclusive, and therefore if one were to happen, another would not, meaning a total showing how sensitive our results are to these external factors is not meaningful.\n\nThe sensitivities included in the tables below broadly have an equal and opposite effect if the sensitivity increases or decreases by the same amount unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (a) Sensitivities on areas of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe table below sets out the sensitivity analysis for certain areas of estimation uncertainty set out in note 1F. These estimates are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the next year. Note that the sensitivity analysis for the useful economic lives of our gas network assets is included in note 13.\n\n|                                                                    | 2022                  | 2022          | 2021                 | 2021           |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|----------------------|----------------|\n|                                                                    | Income  statement  \u00a3m | Net assets \u00a3m | Income statement  \u00a3m | Net  assets \u00a3m |\n| Pensions and other post-retirement benefit liabilities (pre-tax)\u00b9: |                       |               |                      |                |\n| UK discount rate change of 0.5%\u00b2                                   | 12                    | 1,002         | 4                    | 952            |\n| US discount rate change of 0.5%\u00b2                                   | 16                    | 650           | 17                   | 730            |\n| UK RPI rate change of 0.5%\u00b3                                        | 11                    | 733           | 3                    | 723            |\n| UK long-term rate of increase in salaries change of 0.5%           | 4                     | 88            | 1                    | 42             |\n| US long-term rate of increase in salaries change of 0.5%           | 3                     | 41            | 3                    | 42             |\n| UK change of one year to life expectancy at age 65 4               | 4                     | 635           | 1                    | 612            |\n| US change of one year to life expectancy at age 65                 | 3                     | 444           | 4                    | 429            |\n| Assumed US healthcare cost trend rates change of 1%                | 24                    | 414           | 26                   | 437            |\n| Environmental provision:                                           |                       |               |                      |                |\n| 10% change in estimated future cash flows                          | 188                   | 188           | 170                  | 170            |\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits assumptions\n\nSensitivities have been prepared to show how the defined benefit obligations and annual service costs could potentially be impacted by changes in the relevant actuarial assumption that were reasonably possible as at 31 March 2022. In preparing sensitivities, the potential impact has been calculated by applying the change to each assumption in isolation and assuming all other assumptions remain unchanged. This is with the exception of RPI in the UK where the corresponding change to increases to pensions in payment, increases to pensions in deferment and increases in salary are recognised.\n\n## WPD goodwill impairment assessment\n\nSensitivities have been performed to show the impact of reasonable changes to key assumptions in the WPD goodwill impairment test. Considering an increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 0.5% (to 5.7%) indicates the estimated value-in-use would be \u00a31,033 million lower than WPD's carrying amount at 31 March 2022, whilst reducing the terminal growth rate to 2% results in the estimated value-in-use equalling WPD's carrying amount at 31 March 2022.",

Sensitivities continued\n\n## (b) Sensitivities on financial instruments\n\nWe are further required to show additional sensitivity analysis under IFRS 7 and these are shown separately in the subsequent table due to the additional assumptions that are made in order to produce meaningful sensitivity disclosures.\n\nOur net debt as presented in note 29 is sensitive to changes in market variables, primarily being UK and US interest rates, the UK RPI and the dollar to sterling exchange rate. These impact the valuation of our borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments. The analysis illustrates the sensitivity of our financial instruments to reasonably possible changes in these market variables.\n\nThe following main assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis for continuing operations:\n\n- \u00b7  the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2022 and 2021 respectively;\n- \u00b7  the statement of financial position sensitivity to interest rates relates to items presented at their fair values: derivative financial instruments; our investments measured at FVTPL and FVOCI; and our liability measured at FVTPL. Further debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move;\n- \u00b7  the sensitivity of interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments;\n- \u00b7  changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates of designated cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity; and\n- \u00b7  changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges from movements in interest rates are presented in equity as costs of hedging, with a one-year release to the income statement. The impact of movements in the dollar to sterling exchange rate are recorded directly in equity.\n\n|                                        | 2022                | 2022                     | 2021                | 2021                     |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                        | Income statement \u00a3m | Other equity reserves \u00a3m | Income statement \u00a3m | Other equity reserves \u00a3m |\n| Financial risk (post-tax):             |                     |                          |                     |                          |\n| UK RPI change of 0.5%\u00b9                 | 18                  | -                        | 25                  | -                        |\n| UK interest rates change of 0.5%       | 41                  | 134                      | 12                  | 98                       |\n| US interest rates change of 0.5%       | 4                   | 8                        | 6                   | 22                       |\n| US dollar exchange rate change of 10%\u00b2 | 43                  | 397                      | 44                  | 285                      |\n\nOur commodity contract derivatives are sensitive to price risk.

Additional disclosures in respect of guaranteed securities\n\nNiagara Mohawk Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, has issued preferred shares that are listed on a US national securities exchange and are guaranteed by National Grid plc. This guarantor commits to honour any liabilities should the company issuing the debt have any financial difficulties. In order to provide debt holders with information on the financial stability of the company providing the guarantee, we are required to disclose individual financial information for this company. We have chosen to include this information in the Group financial statements rather than submitting separate stand-alone financial statements.\n\nThe following summarised financial information is given in respect of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation as a result of National Grid plc's guarantee, dated 29 October 2007, of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's 3.6% and 3.9% issued preferred shares, which amount to \u00a329 million. National Grid plc's guarantee of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation's preferred shares is full and unconditional. There are no restrictions on the payment of dividends by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation or limitations on National Grid plc's guarantee of the preferred shares, and there are no factors that may affect payments to holders of the guaranteed securities.\n\nThe following summarised financial information for National Grid plc and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation is presented on a combined basis and is intended to provide investors with meaningful and comparable financial information, and is provided pursuant to the early adoption of Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X in lieu of the separate financial statements of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation.\n\nSummarised financial information is presented, on a combined basis, as at 31 March 2022.

The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognised for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and included within Other operating income and costs.\n\n## Acquisition of WPD\n\nOn 14 June 2021, National Grid plc acquired 100% of the share capital of PPL WPD Investments Limited (WPD), the holding company of Western Power Distribution plc, which is the UK's largest electricity distribution network operator. The acquisition, along with the two planned disposals disclosed in note 10, strategically pivots National Grid's UK portfolio towards electricity, in order to significantly enhance National Grid's role in the delivery of the UK's net zero targets, given that electricity distribution is expected to see a high level of asset growth as a result of the ongoing energy transition.\n\nThe total cash consideration for the transaction was \u00a37.9 billion, all of which was paid upfront, with no further contingent or deferred consideration payable. As a result of the acquisition, one of WPD's existing borrowing facilities became repayable immediately due to a change in control clause within the original borrowing agreement. The borrowing facility was immediately replaced with an intercompany loan of \u00a3350 million from National Grid plc. National Grid funded the transaction price and the new intercompany loan by taking out a bridge financing facility (see note 33), that it will commence repaying with the proceeds of the planned disposals.\n\nThe fair values of the assets and liabilities following the finalisation of the purchase price allocation are set out below:\n\n|                                 | IFRS book  value at  acquisition  \u00a3m   | Fair value  adjustments  \u00a3m   | Fair value  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Non-current assets              |                                        |                               |                  |\n| Property, plant and equipment   | 14,077                                 | (4,026)                       | 10,051           |\n| Other intangible assets         | 49                                     | 1,714                         | 1,763            |\n| Pension assets                  | 402                                    | 164                           | 566              |\n| Other non-current assets        | 27                                     | -                             | 27               |\n| Total non-current assets        | 14,555                                 | (2,148)                       | 12,407           |\n| Current assets                  |                                        |                               |                  |\n| Trade and other receivables     | 268                                    | -                             | 268              |\n| Financial and other investments | 69                                     | -                             | 69               |\n| Cash                            | 44                                     | -                             | 44               |\n| Other current assets            | 42                                     | -                             | 42               |\n| Total current assets            | 423                                    | -                             | 423              |\n| Total assets                    | 14,978                                 | (2,148)                       | 12,830           |\n| Current liabilities             |                                        |                               |                  |\n| Borrowings                      | (730)                                  | -                             | (730)            |\n| Trade and other payables        | (531)                                  | 48                            | (483)            |\n| Other current liabilities       | (35)                                   | -                             | (35)             |\n| Total current liabilities       | (1,296)                                | 48                            | (1,248)          |\n| Non-current liabilities         |                                        |                               |                  |\n| Borrowings                      | (5,967)                                | (1,589)                       | (7,556)          |\n| Deferred tax                    | (1,013)                                | 224                           | (789)            |\n| Contract liabilities            | (2,706)                                | 2,706                         | -                |\n| Other non-current liabilities   | (56)                                   | (21)                          | (77)             |\n| Total non-current liabilities   | (9,742)                                | 1,320                         | (8,422)          |\n| Total liabilities               | (11,038)                               | 1,368                         | (9,670)          |\n| Total identifiable net assets   | 3,940                                  | (780)                         | 3,160            |\n| Goodwill                        | 1,254                                  | 3,467                         | 4,721            |\n| Total consideration transferred | 5,194                                  | 2,687                         | 7,881            |\n| Satisfied by:                   |                                        |                               |                  |\n| Cash consideration              |                                        |                               | 7,881            |\n| Total consideration transferred |                                        |                               | 7,881            |",

Acquisitions continued\n\nThe goodwill arising from the acquisition represents the future expected growth in the WPD business, the benefits that are expected to be achieved as a result of the combination of the two businesses and the expertise of the management team acquired. No component of goodwill qualifies for recognition as a separate tangible or intangible asset. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and at the acquisition date, there were no material contingent liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables of \u00a3270 million includes trade receivables with a fair value of \u00a386 million. The gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is \u00a3103 million, of which \u00a317 million was expected to be uncollectible.\n\nTotal acquisition-related costs of \u00a3110 million were recognised within Other operating income and costs, within exceptional items and remeasurements in the consolidated income statement, of which \u00a315 million was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2021 and \u00a395 million in the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\nWPD generated revenues of \u00a31,468 million and profit before tax of \u00a3781 million for the period from 14 June 2021 to 31 March 2022. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2021, the Group's consolidated revenue and consolidated profit before tax from continuing operations for the 12 months ended 31 March 2022 would have been \u00a318,806 million and \u00a33,600 million respectively.\n\n## 38. Post balance sheet events\n\nOn 6 April 2022, the UK government announced that the entirety of ESO will become part of an independent system operator public body, following the Future System Operator (FSO) consultation. The FSO, which is subject to legislative approval, will take on a number of key roles in electricity and gas in Great Britain. The Group is working closely with BEIS and Ofgem to plan and prepare for the implementation of the changes required to create the FSO.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, Ofgem approved the Group's request to return \u00a3200 million of interconnector revenue subject to the cap and floor regime to consumers ahead of schedule (see note 26). This return will take place over the next two years. The Group is now working through the formal steps outlined under the regulatory framework which will result in the finalisation of the mechanism by which the revenues will be returned.",

        "page_content": "## Company accounting policies\n\nWe are required to include the stand-alone balance sheet of our ultimate Parent Company, National Grid plc, under the Companies Act 2006. This is because the publicly traded shares are actually those of National Grid plc (the 'Company') and the following disclosures provide additional information to shareholders.\n\n## A. Basis of preparation\n\nNational Grid plc is the Parent Company of the National Grid Group, which is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity and gas in Great Britain and northeastern US. The Company is a public limited company, limited by shares. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in England, with its registered office at 1-3 Strand, London, WC2N 5EH.\n\nThe financial statements of National Grid plc for the year ended 31 March 2022 were approved by the Board of Directors on 18 May 2022. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these individual financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements the Company applies the recognition and measurement requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the UK, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and sets out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\n\nThese individual financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, and are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. The comparative financial information has also been prepared on this basis.\n\nThese individual financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which presumes that the Company has adequate resources to remain in operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements are signed. As the Company is part of a larger group it participates in the Group's centralised treasury arrangements and so shares banking arrangements with its subsidiaries. The Company is expected to generate positive cash flows or be in a position to obtain finance via intercompany loans to continue to operate for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn accordance with the exemption permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account or statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements of the Company in accordance with FRS 101:\n\n- \u00b7  a cash flow statement and related notes;\n- \u00b7  disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7  disclosures in respect of capital management; and\n- \u00b7  the effects of new but not yet effective IFRS standards.\n\nThe exemption from disclosing key management personnel compensation has not been taken as there are no costs borne by the Company in respect of employees, and no related costs are recharged to the Company.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of National Grid plc, which are available from the registered office, include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 in respect of certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n\nThere are no areas of judgement or key sources of estimation uncertainty that are considered to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe balance sheet has been prepared in accordance with the Company's accounting policies approved by the Board and described below.\n\n## B. Fixed asset investments\n\nInvestments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairments are calculated such that the carrying value of the fixed asset investment is the lower of its cost or recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use. The Company accounts for common control transactions at cost.\n\n## C. Tax\n\nCurrent tax for the current and prior periods is provided at the amount expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or the right to pay less tax, at a future date, at tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet liability method and is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## D. Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at closing exchange rates. Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities are included in the profit and loss account.\n\n## E. Financial instruments\n\nThe Company's accounting policies are the same as the Group's accounting policies under IFRS, namely IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation', IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. The Company applies these policies only in respect of the financial instruments that it has, namely investments, derivative financial instruments, debtors, cash at bank and in hand, borrowings and creditors.\n\nThe policies are set out in notes 15, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company is taking the exemption for financial instruments disclosures, because IFRS 7 disclosures are given in notes 32 and 35 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## F. Hedge accounting\n\nThe Company applies the same accounting policy as the Group in respect of fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. This policy is set out in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## G. Parent Company guarantees\n\nThe Company has guaranteed the repayment of the principal sum, any associated premium and interest on specific loans due by certain subsidiary undertakings primarily to third parties. Such guarantees are accounted for by the Company as insurance contracts. In the event of default or non-performance by the subsidiary, a liability is recorded in accordance with IAS 37.",

Share awards to employees of subsidiary undertakings\n\nThe issuance by the Company to employees of its subsidiaries of a grant over the Company's options represents additional capital contributions by the Company to its subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiaries results in a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. The additional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the option at the date of grant, allocated over the underlying grant's vesting period. Where payments are subsequently received from subsidiaries, these are accounted for as a return of a capital contribution and credited against the Company's investments in subsidiaries. The Company has no employees except for the Group's Non-executive Directors (refer to the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 121).\n\n## I. Dividends\n\nInterim dividends are recognised when they are paid to the Company's shareholders. Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by shareholders.\n\n## J. Directors' remuneration\n\nFull details of Directors' remuneration are disclosed on pages 108 - 131.",

Then, as part of a wider Group restructuring project, National Grid (US) Investments 2 Limited was identified as a subsidiary no longer required and hence a number of accounting steps were implemented to reduce the net assets of that company to a nominal value. These steps included a capital reduction and the payment of dividends to the Company of \u00a32,422 million. Following the receipt of these dividends, the carrying value of the investment was reviewed and an impairment charge was made to the profit and loss account of \u00a32,420 million. It is anticipated that National Grid (US) Investments 2 Limited will be placed into voluntary liquidation in the next financial year.\n\nThe Company's direct subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2022 were as follows: National Grid (US) Holdings Limited, National Grid (US) Investments 2 Limited, National Grid Hong Kong Limited, National Grid Luxembourg SARL and NGG Finance plc.

        "page_content": "## The business in detail\n\n## UK regulation\n\nOur licences to participate in transmission, distribution and interconnection activities are established under the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity Act 1989, as amended (the 'Acts'). These require us to develop, maintain and operate economic and efficient networks and to facilitate competition in the supply of gas and electricity in Great Britain (GB). They also give us statutory powers, including the right to bury our pipes or cables under public highways and the ability to use compulsory powers to purchase land so we can conduct our business.\n\nOur licensed activities are regulated by Ofgem, which has a statutory duty under the Acts to protect the interests of consumers. To protect consumers from the ability of companies to set unduly high prices, Ofgem has established price controls that limit the amount of revenue such regulated businesses can earn. In setting price controls, Ofgem must have regard to the need to secure that licence holders are able to finance their obligations under the Acts. This should give us a level of revenue for the duration of the price control that is sufficient to meet our statutory duties and licence obligations with a reasonable return on our investments. Licensees and other affected parties can appeal price controls or within period licence modifications which have errors, including in respect of financeability.\n\nThe transmission and distribution businesses follow the RIIO (revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs) framework established by Ofgem. There are multiple price controls under this framework, including:\n\n- \u00b7  RIIO-T1 (transmission, April 2013 March/uni00A02021);\n- \u00b7  RIIO-T2 (transmission, April 2021 March/uni00A02026);\n- \u00b7  RIIO-ED1 (electricity distribution, April 2015 - March 2023); and\n- \u00b7  RIIO-ED2 (electricity distribution, April 2023 March 2028).\n\nWhile the RIIO-T1 period has finished, and confirmation of the delivered outputs and performance levels was reported through the annual reporting process in July 2021, there is/uni00A0a/uni00A0close-out process ongoing to finalise adjustments to allowed revenues in respect of/uni00A0a/uni00A0few licence condition obligations for the RIIO-T1 period; this is expected to conclude in/uni00A0November/uni00A02022.\n\nOur UK gas and electricity transmission, electricity distribution (WPD) and system operator businesses operate under four separate/uni00A0price controls, which cover our roles/uni00A0as/uni00A0Transmission Owner (TO) and System Operator (SO) in both gas and electricity, and our/uni00A0electricity distribution activities. National Grid Gas Transmission (NGG) fulfils SO and TO functions for gas, National Grid Electricity Transmission fulfils the TO function for electricity, the Electricity System Operator (ESO) fulfils the SO function for electricity, and WPD fulfils electricity distribution activities. In addition to these four regulated network price controls, there is also a tariff cap price control applied to/uni00A0certain elements of domestic-sized metering/uni00A0activities carried out by National Grid\n\nMetering and regulation of our electricity interconnector interests.\n\nSince 1 April 2019, the ESO has been a legally separate business within the National Grid Group. This means it operates under its own licence and has a separate set of regulatory arrangements, along with strict ringfences for/uni00A0information.\n\nWPD operates under one regulatory framework, the RIIO-ED model. Distribution network operators (DNOs) in the UK are natural monopolies and to ensure value for money for consumers WPD is regulated by Ofgem. The operations are regulated under the distribution licence which sets the requirements that WPD needs to deliver for its customers. In addition to the base level of revenue which the DNOs are allowed to earn, there are incentives to innovate and deliver various outputs relating to customer service, network performance, the environment, connections and efficiency. The achievement or/uni00A0not of targets in relation to these activities can result in rewards or penalties.\n\nMore information on the regulation of the ESO, WPD and interconnectors is given in separate sections below.\n\n## RIIO price controls\n\nThe building blocks of the RIIO price control are broadly similar to the price controls historically used in the UK. There are, however, some significant differences in the mechanics of the/uni00A0calculations.\n\nUnder RIIO, the outputs we deliver are explicitly articulated and our allowed revenues are linked to their delivery, although some outputs and deliverables have only a reputational impact or are linked to legislation. These outputs reflect what our stakeholders have told us they want us/uni00A0to deliver and were determined through an extensive consultation process, which gave stakeholders a greater opportunity to influence the decisions.\n\nUsing information we have submitted, along with independent assessments, including for RIIO-T2 an independent user group report, Ofgem determines the efficient level of expected costs necessary for these deliverables to be achieved. Under RIIO this is known as 'totex', which is a/uni00A0component of total allowable expenditure and/uni00A0is broadly the sum of what was defined in previous price controls as operating expenditure (opex) and capital expenditure (capex).\n\nA number of assumptions are necessary in setting allowances for the outputs that we will deliver, including the volumes of work that will be/uni00A0needed and the price of the various external inputs required to achieve them. Consequently, there are a number of uncertainty mechanisms within the RIIO framework designed to protect consumers and network companies by avoiding the need to set allowances when future needs and costs are uncertain.\n\nWhere we under- or over-spend the allowed totex for reasons that are not covered by uncertainty mechanisms, there is a 'sharing' factor. This means we share the under- or over-spend with customers through an\n\nadjustment to allowed revenues in future years. This sharing factor provides an incentive for us to provide the outputs efficiently, as we are able to keep a portion of savings we make, with the remainder benefitting our customers. Likewise, it/uni00A0provides a level of protection for us if we need to spend more than allowances. Alongside this, there are several specific areas where companies can submit further claims for new allowances within the period, for instance to enable net zero.\n\nAllowed revenue to fund totex costs is split between RIIO 'fast' and 'slow' money categories using specified ratios that are fixed for the duration of the price control. Fast money represents the amount of totex we are able to recover in the year of expenditure. Slow money is added to our Regulatory Asset Value (RAV) - effectively the regulatory IOU.\n\nFor more details on the sharing factors under RIIO for our transmission businesses, please see the tables overleaf.\n\nIn addition to fast money, each year we are\n\nallowed to recover regulatory depreciation, i.e./uni00A0a/uni00A0portion of the RAV, and a return on the outstanding RAV balance. The RAV is also indexed to a measure of inflation, using CPIH in RIIO-T2. For RIIO-T2, regulatory depreciation for/uni00A0ET continues on a straight-line depreciation methodology over 45 years, while Gas Transmission (GT) moves from straight-line to sum-of-digit depreciation (so that depreciation is/uni00A0front loaded but then lower in the later years of/uni00A0the life of the asset). We are also allowed to collect additional revenues related to noncontrollable costs and incentives. In addition to totex sharing, RIIO incentive mechanisms can increase or decrease our allowed revenue to reflect our performance against various other measures related to our outputs. For example, in/uni00A0RIIO-T2 there are rewards and penalties for performance against incentives. These incentive payments are a function of allowed revenue and could result in potential upsides for electricity transmission (ET) of up to \u00a315 million and downsides in the region of \u00a347 million, therefore incentivising us to deliver the agreed outputs. For gas transmission (GT) the upside is \u00a315.1 million of allowed revenue with a downside of \u00a314 million. Ofgem will consult on the maximum range of potential upside and downside for RIIO-ED2 as part of its July 2022 publication, and finalise the position in the winter 2022 Final Determination, covering the period from April 2023 to March 2028.\n\n## The RIIO-ED1 price control\n\nFrom 1 April 2015, Ofgem set an eight-year electricity price control (known as RIIO-ED1). WPD submitted an outputs-based Business Plan for the RIIO-ED1 period (2015 - 2023), which was accepted by Ofgem as 'well justified' and could therefore 'fast-track' all four WPD licensed areas; the only DNO group to be fast-tracked. WPD's modified licences took effect from 1 April 2015. Our 76 commitments within the RIIO-ED1 Business Plan fall within the following six categories: safety, reliability, environment, connections, customer satisfaction and social/uni00A0obligations.",

These include financial incentives that/uni00A0encourage us to:\n\n- \u00b7  efficiently deliver, through investment and maintenance, the network outputs that customers and stakeholders require, including/uni00A0reliable supplies, new connections and infrastructure capacity; and\n- \u00b7  innovate so we can continuously improve the/uni00A0services we provide to our customers, stakeholders and communities.\n\n## More information on RIIO-T2\n\nIn December 2019 we submitted our Business Plans to Ofgem for the RIIO-T2 period, setting out the proposed activities and expenditure to/uni00A0meet the needs of our customers and stakeholders in the period 1 April 2021 31 March 2026. These plans were developed through extensive, enhanced stakeholder engagement to improve the quality and ensure they delivered what our stakeholders need.\n\nTo support this process, independent user groups were set up in July 2018, one for GT and/uni00A0one for ET (the 'IUGs'). Their responsibility was to ensure that the companies were putting stakeholders at the heart of their decisionmaking processes so as to produce a Business Plan that was fully reflective of customers', consumers' and other stakeholders'\n\nrequirements. They summarised their views in an independent report to Ofgem on the companies' RIIO-T2 Business Plans in December 2019.\n\nThe IUGs represent a/uni00A0cross-section of the energy industry and/uni00A0represent the interests of consumers, environmental and public interest groups, as well/uni00A0as large-scale and small-scale customers and distribution networks.\n\nThe IUGs have now taken on an enduring role through RIIO-T2. There are three key focus areas, which are to:\n\n- \u00b7  scrutinise and challenge the periodic Business/uni00A0Plans;\n- \u00b7  monitor, interrogate and help the business to/uni00A0enhance transparency of performance against commitments; and\n- \u00b7  act as a 'critical friend' for strategy, culture/uni00A0and processes in key areas such/uni00A0as/uni00A0stakeholder engagement, innovation,/uni00A0customers, consumers and responsible/uni00A0business.\n\nOfgem published its Final Determinations in December 2020, followed by the RIIO-T2 licences and Regulatory Instructions and Guidance in February 2021. The RIIO-T2 price controls started on 1 April 2021. On 2 March 2021, National Grid announced that it was broadly accepting most of the RIIO-T2 package for its ET and GT businesses, but had decided to submit a technical appeal to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in relation to ET and GT focused on Ofgem's proposed cost of/uni00A0equity and 'outperformance wedge' (a/uni00A0downward adjustment to allowed returns in/uni00A0expectation of future outperformance).\n\n## Key parameters from Ofgem's RIIO-T2 Determinations for GT and ET\n\n|                                                                                    | Gas Transmission                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Electricity Transmission                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Allowed Return on Equity 1                                                         | 4.55% (real, relative to CPIH)                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 4.25% (real, relative to CPIH), at 55%  gearing (which is broadly equivalent to  4.55% at 60% gearing)                                                                                                                          |\n| Allowed debt funding                                                               | Calculated and updated each year using an extending 'trombone-like' trailing  average of iBoxx Utilities 10+ year index (increases from 10 years for 2021/22  to 14 years for 2025/26), plus 25 bps additional borrowing costs. | Calculated and updated each year using an extending 'trombone-like' trailing  average of iBoxx Utilities 10+ year index (increases from 10 years for 2021/22  to 14 years for 2025/26), plus 25 bps additional borrowing costs. |\n| Depreciation of RAV                                                                | 45-year sum-of-digit regulatory  depreciation applied to RIIO-T2  additions and retrospectively to 2002  - 2021 additions.                                                                                                      | No change in policy: straight line over  45 years for post-2021 RAV additions,  with pre-2021 RAV additions as per  RIIO-T1.                                                                                                    |\n| Notional gearing                                                                   | 60%                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 55%                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Split between fast/slow money                                                      | Fast: TO baseline 35%;

The cost of equity in RIIO-T2 is subject to annual adjustments that are calculated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model, through indexation of the 'risk-free rate' parameter. The 4.55% and 4.25% figures shown in this row are Ofgem's estimates of the average allowed Return on Equity over the five years of RIIO-T2, as given in the RIIO-T2 Price Control Financial Model published in November 2021.\n\nIn/uni00A0October/uni00A02021, the CMA found in favour of the technical arguments we put forward in respect of the 'outperformance wedge' but not on the cost of/uni00A0equity.\n\nRIIO-T2 builds on the framework established for RIIO-T1. For example, it introduces a range of new mechanisms to facilitate the transition to net/uni00A0zero, and it increases support for innovation, for example by allowing the regulator to direct additional funding in gas transportation for hydrogen innovation, in recognition of the uncertainty around the extent networks may have a role in transporting hydrogen.\n\n## Competition in onshore transmission\n\nOfgem stated in its final decision on the RIIO-T1 price control that it would consider holding a/uni00A0competition to appoint the constructor and owner of suitably large new electricity transmission projects, rather than including these new outputs and allowances in existing transmission licensee price controls. Ofgem reiterated this view in the RIIO-T2 Determination, extending it now to gas transmission and gas distribution. In the absence, thus far, of the legislation needed to support a competition, Ofgem has developed a number of models which it has indicated it would consider using to deliver benefits of competition, the primary one of these being called the 'Competition Proxy Model', but so far this has not been used for any/uni00A0projects or implemented into licences. The/uni00A0December 2020 BEIS energy white paper reiterated the government's ambition to introduce greater competition to support the delivery of net zero targets but also explained that the introduction of legislation to support full/uni00A0third-party competition would be subject\n\nto/uni00A0available parliamentary time.\n\n## Regulation of the Electricity System/uni00A0Operator\n\nA primary goal of the ESO legal separation in April 2019 was to increase transparency of our activities and help minimise any perceived conflicts of interest as we take on the challenge of driving forward the energy transformation. There are clear signals from Ofgem and the broader regulatory context that the ESO will play/uni00A0a crucial role in the changing energy environment. As an asset-light and servicebased entity, the ESO is also fundamentally different from other regulated network companies. The RIIO-2 price control therefore implemented a bespoke framework for the ESO, recognising that it is different from other regulated businesses.\n\nAs part of the RIIO-2 process, the ESO published a five-year Business Plan in December 2019, followed by a detailed two-year delivery schedule in October 2020 (covering the two-year Business Plan 1 (BP1) period). These documents, which were developed following extensive stakeholder engagement, set out the ESO's planned activities and how they fit with its high-level ambitions. However, as the ESO's funding uses a pass-through mechanism (where all efficiently incurred costs can be recovered through regulated revenues), the ESO has the flexibility to deviate from its published plans, delivering additional activities where there is an opportunity to benefit consumers. The ESO's recent work on an Early Competition Plan and supporting the Offshore Transmission Network Review are examples of such activities.",

        "page_content": "The RIIO-2 regulatory framework includes a/uni00A0return on RAV but also provides additional non-RAV funding for roles and risks that are not linked to an asset base. There is no totex incentive mechanism for the ESO in RIIO-2, which means that the ESO has greater flexibility to adjust spending in order to deliver its ambitious Business Plan and maximise consumer benefit. ESO performance in RIIO-2 will continue to be assessed via an evaluative incentive approach, through a two-year incentive scheme with a total maximum reward of \u00a330 million and maximum penalty of \u00a312 million for the two-year period. As/uni00A0part of this incentive scheme, a Performance Panel (the 'Panel') of industry stakeholders scores the ESO on its performance, taking into account the delivery of its plans, numerical metrics such as balancing costs, stakeholder interactions, the benefit the ESO has delivered for consumers and the extent to which the ESO's activities have delivered value for money. The Panel scores performance and gives feedback on a six-monthly basis, with the final set of scores in summer 2023 informing the reward or penalty awarded by Ofgem at the end of the two-year BP1 period.\n\nOn 29 April 2022 the ESO published its draft plan for the Business Plan 2 (BP2) period, which runs from April 2023 to March 2025. Following engagement with industry the ESO will publish a/uni00A0final BP2 in August 2022. Ofgem is expected to publish its Draft Determinations on ESO's BP2 in November 2022, with Final Determinations in March 2023.\n\nThe challenge of net zero, the required speed of/uni00A0decarbonisation and the level of industry and societal change mean that structures and roles across the energy industry will need to evolve. In summer 2021, Ofgem and BEIS jointly consulted on the future of energy system operation. The consultation proposed that the creation of a future system operator, built on the existing capability of the ESO, is a key next step to accelerate the transition to net zero. BEIS and Ofgem have now made their final decision to proceed with the creation of a future system operator that is independent of National Grid. This decision means that, in time, the entirety of/uni00A0the ESO will become part of a new organisation, as well as certain long-term strategic activities for gas. The announcement does not include the operational functions of the Gas System Operator (GSO), which will remain part of NGG. We will continue to collaborate with BEIS, Ofgem and the wider industry following the outcome of this consultation.\n\n## Interconnectors regulation\n\nInterconnectors derive their revenues from sales of capacity to users who wish to move power between market areas with different prices. Up until 31 December 2020, this was governed under European legislation and these capacity sales are classified as 'congestion revenues'. This is because the market price differences result from congestion on the established\n\ninterconnector capacity which limits full price convergence. European legislation governed how congestion revenues may be used and how interconnection capacity is allocated. It requires all interconnection capacity to be allocated to the market through auctions. From 1 January 2021, interconnectors to the UK are no longer governed by European legislation, and the operation of these interconnectors is governed by individual sets of access rules which are agreed by regulators at each end of the link. This does not affect the fundamental business model for interconnectors.\n\nUnder UK legislation, interconnection businesses must be separate from transmission businesses.\n\nThere is a range of different regulatory models available for interconnector projects. These involve various levels of regulatory intervention, ranging from fully merchant (where the project is fully reliant on sales of interconnector capacity) to cap and floor.\n\nThe cap and floor regime is now the regulated route for interconnector investment in GB and may be sought by project developers who do not qualify for, or do not wish to apply for, exemptions from UK and European legislation which would facilitate a merchant development.\n\n## Regulation of WPD\n\nLooking to the future, RIIO-ED2 covering the period 1 April 2023 - 31 March 2028, is the second electricity distribution price control to be set under the RIIO model. The first draft of our RIIO-ED2 Business Plan was submitted to Ofgem's Challenge Group on 1 July 2021 and the final submission was made on 1 December 2021. Ofgem's Draft Determinations are expected in July 2022 with Final Determinations due by winter 2022.\n\nFollowing the government's recent legislation for/uni00A0net zero carbon by 2050, DNOs will be at the forefront of its delivery, enabling the transition to/uni00A0a smart, flexible, low-cost and low-carbon energy system for all consumers and network/uni00A0users.\n\nOur RIIO-ED2 Business Plan has been cocreated with our stakeholders, following an enhanced and extensive approach to stakeholder engagement with over 25,000 stakeholders being consulted. We provided our/uni00A0stakeholders an opportunity to review our/uni00A0Business Plan three times before the final submission to Ofgem. Our Business Plan has/uni00A0evolved based of the feedback from our stakeholders, the Customer Engagement Groups (CEG) and Ofgem's Challenge Group. Most notable changes have been a/uni00A0reduction of core commitments that demonstrate that they are all well justified, an increase to the ex-ante load-related expenditure to reflect our best view of low-carbon technology (LCT) take-up and additional strategies including the Business Innovation and Efficiency strategy, which clearly demonstrate how WPD will offer best value for our customers.\n\nThe core commitments, as included in our Business Plan, fall within three key headings driven by Ofgem. These focus on meeting the needs of consumers and network users, maintaining a safe and resilient network, and delivering an environmentally sustainable service. Every core commitment in our draft Business Plan is in response to an area of focus identified as a/uni00A0priority by stakeholders. Some of the key commitments include:\n\n## Sustainability: Leading the drive to net zero as/uni00A0early as possible\n\n- \u00b7  Facilitating regions achieving net zero carbon/uni00A0by as early as 2028 in line with local/uni00A0authority ambitions.\n- \u00b7  WPD to be net zero by 2028 for our own business carbon footprint (excluding network/uni00A0losses).\n\n## Connectability: Customers can connect their electric vehicles and heat pumps when they want to\n\n- \u00b7  Ready for an additional 1.5 million electric vehicles and 600,000 heat pumps to be connected during RIIO-ED2, providing affordable, LCT connections without/uni00A0delays.\n- \u00b7  An online tool for same day self-assessment for the connection of LCTs to our network.\n\n## Vulnerability: First class vulnerable customer support programme where everyone benefits in a smart future\n\n- \u00b7  600,000 smart energy plans offered to customers in vulnerable situations each year.\n- \u00b7  \u00a360 million saved by 113,000 fuel poor customers as a result of our ED2 support schemes.\n\nAffordability: Maintain excellent customer service, safety and network performance, and transform the energy grid for future generations, whilst maintaining affordability for our customers\n\n- \u00b7  Targeting 93%+ on customer satisfaction in/uni00A0ED2.\n- \u00b7  Lowest ever levels of power cuts.",

        "page_content": "## The business in detail continued\n\n## US regulation\n\n## Regulators\n\nIn the US, public utilities' retail transactions are regulated by state utility commissions which serve as economic regulators, approving cost recovery and authorised rates of return. The state commissions establish the retail rates to recover the cost of transmission and distribution services within their jurisdictions. They also serve the public interest by making sure utilities provide safe and reliable services at just and reasonable prices. The commissions establish service standards and approve public utility mergers and acquisitions. State commissions are also asked to approve a variety of programmes and costs related to state energy and climate goals.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulates wholesale transactions for utilities, such as interstate transmission and wholesale electricity sales, including rates for these services, at the federal level. FERC also regulates public utility holding companies and centralised service companies, including those of our US businesses.\n\n## Regulatory process\n\nThe US regulatory regime is premised on allowing the utility the opportunity to recover its cost of service and earn a reasonable return on its investments as determined by each commission. Utilities submit formal rate filings (rate cases) to the relevant state regulator when additional revenues are necessary to provide safe, reliable service to customers. Additionally, utilities can be compelled to file a rate case, either due to complaints filed with the commission or at the commission's own discretion.\n\nThe rate case is typically litigated with parties representing customers and other interests. The utility is required to prove that the requested rate change is just and reasonable, and the requested rate plan can span multiple years. In the states where we operate, it can typically take 9 13 months for/uni00A0the commission to render a final decision, although, in some instances, rules allow for longer negotiation periods which may extend the length of the rate case proceeding. Unlike the state processes, FERC, as the federal regulator, has no specified timeline for adjudicating a rate case; typically it makes a final decision retroactively when the case is completed.\n\nGas and electricity rates are established from a/uni00A0revenue requirement, or cost of service, equal to the utility's total cost of providing distribution or delivery service to its customers, as approved by the commission in the rate case. This revenue requirement includes operating expenses, depreciation, taxes, and a fair and reasonable return on shareholder capital invested in certain components of the utility's regulated asset base or 'rate base'.\n\nThe final revenue requirement and rates for service are approved in the rate case decision. The revenue requirement is derived from a comprehensive study of the utility's total costs during a representative 12-month period, referred to as a test year. Each commission has its own rules and standards for adjustments to the test year. These may include forecast capital investments and operating costs.\n\n## US regulatory revenue requirement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A Rate base\n- B Debt\n- C Equity\n- D Return\n- E Controllable costs\n- F Non-controllable costs\n- G Depreciation\n- H Taxes\n- I  Lagged recoveries\n- J  Allowed revenue\n\n## Our rate plans\n\nEach operating company has a set of rates for service. We have three electric distribution operations (upstate New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island) and five gas distribution networks (upstate New York, New York City, Long Island, Massachusetts and Rhode Island).\n\nOur distribution operating companies have revenue-decoupling mechanisms that delink their revenues from the quantity of energy delivered and billed to customers. These mechanisms remove the natural disincentive utility companies have for promoting and encouraging customer participation in energyefficiency programmes that lower energy end use and distribution volumes.\n\nWe bill our customers for their use of electricity and gas services. Customer bills typically cover the cost of the commodity (electricity or gas delivered), and charges covering our delivery service. With the exception of residential gas customers in Rhode Island, our customers are allowed to select an unregulated competitive supplier for the commodity component of electricity and gas utility services.\n\nA substantial proportion of our costs, in particular electricity and gas commodity purchases, are 'pass-through' costs, fully recoverable from our customers. We recover 'pass-through' costs through making separate charges to customers, designed to recover those costs with no profit. We adjust the charges from time to time, often annually to make sure that any over- or under-recovery of these costs is returned to, or recovered from, our customers.\n\nOur rate plans are designed to a specific allowed Return on Equity (RoE), by reference to an allowed operating expense level and rate base. Some rate plans include earnings-sharing mechanisms that allow us to retain a proportion of the earnings above our allowed RoE, achieved through improving efficiency, with the balance benefitting customers.\n\nIn addition, our performance under certain rate plans is subject to service performance targets. We may be subject to monetary penalties in cases where we do not meet those targets.\n\nOur FERC-regulated transmission companies use formula rates (instead of periodic stated rate cases) to set rates annually that recover their cost of service. Through the use of annual true-ups, formula rates recover our actual costs incurred and the allowed RoE based on the actual transmission rate base each year. We must make annual formula rate filings documenting the revenue requirement that customers can review and challenge.\n\nRevenue for our wholesale transmission businesses in New England and New York is/uni00A0collected from wholesale transmission customers. These are typically other utilities and/uni00A0include our own New England electricity distribution businesses. With the exception of upstate New York, which continues to combine retail transmission and distribution rates to end-use customers, these wholesale transmission costs are generally incurred by distribution utilities on behalf of their customers. They are fully recovered as a pass-through from end-use customers, as approved by each state/uni00A0commission.\n\nOur Long Island generation plants sell capacity to the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) under 15-year and 25-year power supply agreements and within wholesale tariffs approved by FERC. Through the use of cost-based formula rates, these long-term contracts provide a similar economic effect to cost-of-service rate/uni00A0regulation.\n\nOne measure used to monitor the performance of our regulated businesses is a comparison of achieved RoE to allowed RoE. However, this measure cannot be used in isolation, as several factors may prevent us from achieving the allowed RoE. These include financial market conditions, regulatory lag (e.g. the time period after a rate or expense is approved for recovery but before we collect the same from customers)",

        "page_content": "and decisions by the regulator preventing cost recovery in rates from customers.\n\nWe work to increase achieved RoE through:\n\n- \u00b7  productivity improvements;\n- \u00b7  positive performance against incentives or earned savings mechanisms, such as available energy-efficiency programmes; and\n- \u00b7  filing a new rate case when achieved returns are lower than those the Company could reasonably expect to attain through a new rate case.\n\n## US regulatory filings\n\nThe objectives of our rate case filings are to make sure we have the right cost of service and are able to earn a fair and reasonable rate of return, while providing a safe, reliable and economical service. To achieve these objectives and reduce regulatory lag, we have been successful in many cases in obtaining relief, such/uni00A0as:\n\n- \u00b7  revenue decoupling mechanisms;\n- \u00b7  capital trackers;\n- \u00b7  commodity-related bad debt true-ups;\n- \u00b7  pension and other post-employment benefit true-ups, separately from base rates; and\n- \u00b7  performance-based frameworks such as incentives and multi-year plans.\n\nWe explain these terms in the table on page/uni00A0252.\n\nBelow, we summarise significant, recent developments in rate filings and the regulatory environment. A joint proposal setting forth a three-year rate plan for KEDNY and KEDLI was approved by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYPSC) in August 2021. A joint proposal, setting forth a three-year rate plan for Niagara Mohawk, was approved by the NYPSC in January 2022.\n\nAn amended settlement agreement setting forth a/uni00A0three-year rate plan for The Narragansett Electric Company was approved by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (RIPUC) in August 2018. The multi-year rate plan includes an interim fourth year, effective 1 September 2021.\n\nIn November 2018, we made a full rate case filing for Massachusetts Electric which resulted in a five-year performance-based ratemaking plan in September 2019. In November 2020, we made a full rate case filing for Boston Gas resulting in a five-year performance-based ratemaking plan in September 2021.\n\n## Massachusetts\n\n## Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric rate cases\n\nWe filed a rate case for Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric with the MADPU on 15 November 2018 with new rates effective on 1 October 2019. The Massachusetts Electric rate case was the first for Massachusetts Electric and Nantucket Electric since the case was filed in 2015. It updated the electric companies' rates to more closely align revenues with the cost of service and bring their earned RoEs closer to the allowed RoE. New rates were approved with an allowed RoE of 9.6% on an equity ratio of 53.5%. The MADPU approved a five-year performance-\n\nbased ratemaking plan, which adjusts distribution rates annually based on a predetermined formula. As part of its decision, the MADPU required a management audit addressing the Company's strategic planning processes, staffing decisions and its relationship to National Grid USA Service Company, among other items.\n\n## Boston Gas Company rate case\n\nOn 30 September 2021, the MADPU issued an order in Boston Gas Company's most recent rate case. The MADPU decision: (1) allowed an increase in base revenues of $144.86 million, as compared with the request for $220.74 million; (2) authorised a RoE of 9.70%, raised from the previous RoE of 9.5%; (3) authorised a capital structure of 53.44% equity and 46.56% debt; and (4) allowed for recovery of the costs of 133 new, incremental full-time employees. The decision also approved the Company's proposed five-year performance-based ratemaking plan which adjusts distribution rates annually based on a predetermined formula. Boston Gas had also presented its Future of Heat proposals to address Massachusetts' ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. These proposals are innovative programmes and demonstration projects that the Company has developed to reduce emissions, promote gas demand response, and encourage the development of sustainable heating options and new technologies to advance low-carbon heating solutions. Ultimately, the MADPU elected to remove our Future of Heat proposals from the rate case without prejudice for their consideration as part of other proceedings. Subsequently, on 15 December 2021, the MADPU approved the Company's geothermal district energy demonstration programme for five years with a budget of $15.6 million.\n\n## Electric vehicles (EV)\n\nTo support Massachusetts' zero emission vehicle targets, in July 2021 the Company filed its Phase III EV charging programme with the MADPU, building on the success of two prior programmes and representing the secondlargest such proposal in the US. The proposal requests MADPU approval for $278 million in spending to enable 7,500 public and workplace ports, 24,000 residential ports, and 600 fleet charging ports, as well to support electric school bus conversions in environmental justice communities, and expansion of the Company's off-peak charging rebate programme.\n\n## Investigation into role of gas distribution\n\ncompanies in achieving climate change goals On 29 October 2020, the MADPU issued an order opening an investigation into the role of gas distribution companies in achieving Massachusetts' 2050 climate goals. On or before 18 March 2022, each company was required to submit a proposal to the MADPU that includes its recommendations and plans for helping Massachusetts achieve its 2050 climate goals, supported by an independent consultant's report, that incorporates feedback and advice obtained through a stakeholder process. Supported by the consultant's analysis, National Grid's proposal envisions meeting the state's 2050 climate goals by utilising a decarbonised and integrated gas and electric system that:\n\n- \u00b7  increases investment in and adoption of/uni00A0energy-efficiency measures;\n- \u00b7  eliminates fossil fuels from our gas supply by/uni00A0pursuing delivery of fossil-free gas such as/uni00A0renewable natural gas and renewable hydrogen through our network to all our/uni00A0customers;\n- \u00b7  enables customer use of hybrid heating by supporting customer adoption of heating technologies best suited to their needs; and\n- \u00b7  utilises targeted electrification, including new solutions such as networked geothermal where safe and cost-effective.\n\n## Management audit\n\nOn 30 September 2019, in its decision regarding Massachusetts Electric Company and Nantucket Electric Company's most recent request for a/uni00A0change in base distribution rates, the MADPU required a comprehensive independent management audit of the Company, including a/uni00A0review of its relationship to the NGSC.\n\nThe final audit report was issued on 29 March 2021. On 30 April 2021, the Company filed a/uni00A0proposal for implementation of the audit's recommendations. The DPU issued a final order/uni00A0on 24 November 2021, directing Massachusetts Electric Company and Nantucket/uni00A0Electric Company to implement the recommendations contained in the Final Report and file a comprehensive update regarding implementation of the recommendations at or around the time of its next base rate proceeding.\n\n## The MADPU inquiry regarding COVID-19/uni00A0customer assistance and ratemaking matters\n\nStarting with the First Set of Orders on 24 March 2020, the Chairman of the MADPU issued a series of orders in response to the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the First Set of Orders, the MADPU prohibited the utilities from terminating service to any customer (including residential, commercial and industrial customers) for non-payment of utility bills until the state of emergency is lifted. The state extended the moratorium for residential customers several times, with the last extension until 1 July 2021, while the moratorium for commercial and industrial (C&I) expired in autumn 2020. Effective 1 July 2021, the Company resumed normal collection activities, which includes issuing notices of amounts in arrears and alerting customers that their service is subject to disconnection for non-payment.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, the MADPU approved the consensus implementation issues related to/uni00A0the ratemaking treatment of the COVID-19 customer assistance programmes and determined that the remaining contested issues, including the extent to which the companies will be allowed to recover their COVID-19 costs, should be fully adjudicated in a new proceeding which is currently pending before the MADPU.",

        "page_content": "## The business in detail continued\n\n## Grid Modernisation Plan (GMP)\n\nOn 19 August 2015, the Company, together with Nantucket Electric, filed its first proposed GMP with the MADPU. On 10 May 2018, the MADPU issued an order in this proceeding. The order approved $82 million in grid-facing investments over three years in: (1) conservation voltage reduction and volt/volt-amps reactive optimisation; (2) advanced distribution automation; (3) feeder monitors; (4) communications and information/operational technologies; and (5) advanced distribution management/distribution supervisory control and data acquisition. The MADPU allowed recovery of both operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs through a reconciling mechanism. The MADPU did not approve any customer-facing (i.e. advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)) investments; the DPU said it would address these in a further investigation to see if there are ways to achieve cost-effective deployment of these investments. The Company has filed annual reports and cost recovery filings with the MADPU for its GMP in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The Company filed its next proposed four-year GMP (for calendar years 2022 - 2025) on 1 July 2021, which includes proposals to continue the previously-approved investments (designated as 'Track 1' in the proceeding), invest in a distributed energy resource management system (DERMS), conduct two demonstration projects, and deploy AMI (designated as Track 2 in the proceeding). Proceedings on Track 1 have concluded, and on/uni00A030 December 2021, the MADPU issued an interim order allowing investments in Track 1 to continue pending the MADPU's final order on Track 1. The MADPU's investigation of Track 2 is/uni00A0ongoing, with orders expected sometime in/uni00A02022.\n\n## New York\n\n## Downstate New York 2019 rate cases\n\nIn August 2021, the NYSPSC approved a three-year rate plan for our downstate New York gas businesses, commencing retroactively from 1 April 2020 through to 31 March 2023. The rate plan includes: an 8.8% RoE and 48% equity ratio; gas revenue decreases of $4.7 million for KEDNY and $22.8 million for KEDLI in 2020/21, gas revenue increases of $47 million for KEDNY and $28.9 million for KEDLI in 2021/22, and gas revenue increases of $73.3 million for KEDNY and $26.2 million for KEDLI in 2022/23; funding for a three-year capital plan of approximately $2 billion for KEDNY and $1.3 billion for KEDLI; annual reconciliation mechanisms for certain noncontrollable costs (e.g. property taxes, pension/ OPEBs, and site investigation remediation costs); a gas safety and reliability surcharge to recover the costs of incremental leak-prone pipe replacement; and a number of incentive mechanisms, including earnings adjustment mechanisms (EAMs), which provide a potential incentive of approximately $3.9 million and $2.5 million annually for KEDNY and KEDLI respectively. There is an option to extend the plan for a fourth rate year with a net plant capital tracker. The rate plan agreement includes a commitment by the Company to evaluate the impact of New York's climate laws on its gas business and infrastructure, including the depreciation of its gas assets.\n\n## NMPC rate case\n\nIn January 2022, the NYPSC approved a three-year rate settlement for NMPC's electric and gas business commencing retroactively from 1 July 2021 and continuing through 30 June 2024. The rate plan provides for electric revenue increases of $49 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2022, $96 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2023 and $110 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2024, and gas revenue increases of $13 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2022, $29 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2023, and $33 million for the rate year ending 30 June 2024. The rate plan includes: a 9.0% RoE and 48% equity ratio; funding for a three-year capital plan of approximately $2.5 billion for electric and $0.8 billion for gas; annual reconciliation mechanisms for certain non-controllable costs (e.g. property taxes, pension/OPEBs, and site investigation remediation costs); a gas safety and reliability surcharge to recover the costs of incremental leak-prone pipe replacement; and a/uni00A0number of incentive mechanisms, including EAMs, which provide a potential incentive of approximately $106 million and $8 million annually for electric and gas, respectively. The settlement also provides funding for NMPC's advanced metering infrastructure deployment in its upstate New York service territory. There is an option to extend the rate plan to 31 March 2025 and the agreement includes a commitment by the Company to evaluate the impact of New York's climate laws on its gas business and infrastructure, including the depreciation of its gas assets.\n\n## Downstate gas supply constraints\n\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the state of New York that resolved all claims relating to KEDNY and KEDLI's imposition of restrictions on service connections implemented in 2019. A total of $36 million in customer assistance, gas conservation measures and clean energy investments was committed by the companies, along with the appointment of an external monitor and the requirement to deliver a plan to/uni00A0address service to customers through winter 2020/21. In the interest of promoting transparency and to assure the public of the Company's commitment to identifying long-term solutions for the region's energy challenges, we extended the engagement of the external monitor through September 2021. The settlement agreement also provided a framework for identifying longer-term solutions to address the supply constraints in downstate New York. We developed a range of options to address the natural gas constraints facing the region, which were presented at a series of public meetings in/uni00A0the downstate New York service territory. KEDNY and KEDLI are now working with regulators, stakeholders and customers to implement long-term solutions to the gas supply constraints in the region. In February 2021, the/uni00A0NYPSC approved an amendment to the Settlement Agreement, which repurposed $20 million of shareholder funding to offset the costs of KEDNY and KEDLI's energy efficiency and demand response programmes.\n\nIn/uni00A0September 2021, the monitor issued a closing report that summarised our performance under the settlement over the course of the 18-month term of the monitorship, described our efforts to implement the monitor's various recommendations, and offered new recommendations related to the ongoing efforts to meet gas demand in downstate New York.\n\n## COVID-19 response New York\n\nThe New York State Legislature, in response to the financial impacts of COVID-19 on utility customers, enacted a moratorium on service terminations for non-payment of any overdue charges for the duration of the COVID-19 state of emergency. Further, for customers who attest to a change in financial circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these protections were extended to 21 December 2021, an additional 180 days following the end of the declared state of emergency.\n\n## Fraud investigation\n\nOn 17 June 2021, five former National Grid employees in the downstate New York facilities department were arrested on federal charges alleging conspiracy and bribery. National Grid has been identified as a victim of the alleged crimes and will continue to cooperate with the government's investigation. The NYPSC is reviewing the matter and the MADPU and the/uni00A0RIPUC have each issued requests for information related to the alleged criminal conduct. At this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the regulatory review or determine the amount, if any, of any potential liabilities that may be incurred by the Company related to this matter. However, we do not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\n\n## Other important regulatory updates\n\nOn 12 February 2021, the Department of Public Service Staff issued white papers on gas system planning that propose:\n\n- \u00b7  a process for modernising the long-term gas planning process in New York; and\n- \u00b7  procedures for managing future moratoria on new gas service connections resulting from supply constraints.\n\n'The Gas Planning Paper' proposes significant changes to the reporting and regulatory oversight for gas supply planning, including that the NYPSC direct New York's distribution companies to begin filing long-term supply plans every three years. These supply plans would be similar in many respects to our long-term report for downstate New York, in terms of identifying and analysing various supply options to address different demand scenarios. The NYPSC proposes potential financial incentive mechanisms for developing non-pipeline alternatives, including potential incentives for sourcing renewable natural gas and promoting electrification. 'The Moratorium Paper' proposes a roadmap for managing future moratoria, including requirements for stakeholder notifications, communications plans and applicant management. An NYPSC decision in/uni00A0this proceeding is pending.",

        "page_content": "In September 2021, the NYPSC approved Niagara Mohawk's petition seeking approval to/uni00A0dispatch and market the output from a/uni00A0Company-owned energy storage facility into the wholesale markets administered by the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO). The facility consists of a single 2MW/3MWh energy storage unit that was installed to mitigate a potential thermal overload of a substation transformer but is only needed for local reliability support during the summer months of June to September. The NYPSC authorised the Company to bid the energy, capacity and/or ancillary services available from the facility into the NYISO-administered wholesale markets when not needed for local reliability support with/uni00A0the financial gains from any such market transactions accruing entirely to the benefit of Niagara Mohawk's customers. This authorisation for dual participation will provide financial benefits to the Company's customers that funded the facility and will provide valuable learning opportunities in advance of managing the third-party-owned bulk energy storage projects being procured through competitive requests for/uni00A0proposals pursuant to NYPSC orders.\n\nIn addition, in October 2021, KEDNY and KEDLI filed to secure approval for a demand-side management programme that would deploy unprecedented levels of non-infrastructure solutions (e.g. the energy efficiency and demand response programme) to meet customers' energy needs and address a looming gas capacity shortfall on the Company's systems in a/uni00A0manner that supports New York's aggressive climate goals. A NYPSC decision is pending.\n\n## Rhode Island\n\n## Rhode Island combined gas and electric rate case\n\nOn 24 August 2018, the RIPUC approved the terms of an Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA), which took effect on 1 September 2018. We/uni00A0are currently in year four of the Company's multi-year rate plan. On 30 June 2021, the Division consented to an extension of the term of/uni00A0the rate plan such that the Company is not required to file its next rate case so that new rates take effect no later than 1 September 2022. The ASA will remain in effect and the Company will continue to operate under the current rate plan until a new rate plan is approved by the RIPUC. The Company filed a/uni00A0copy of the Division consent letter with the RIPUC on 15 July 2021. Base distribution rates will remain at the Rate Year 3 levels until the next base rate case. The ASA includes an Electric Transportation Initiative (ET Initiative) to facilitate the growth of EV options and scaling of/uni00A0the market for EV charging equipment to advance Rhode Island's zero emission vehicles and greenhouse gas emissions policy goals. The/uni00A0ET Initiative includes the following five/uni00A0components:\n\n- \u00b7  off-Peak Charging Rebate Pilot;\n- \u00b7  charging Station Demonstration Programme;\n- \u00b7  discount Pilot for Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) Station Accounts;\n- \u00b7  fleet Advisory Services; and\n- \u00b7  electric Transportation Initiative Evaluation.\n\nAs of the end of Rate Year 2, the Charging Station Demonstration Programme achieved 72% of ET Initiative targets for Level 2 ports and 7% of the target for DCFC ports. The ASA also includes two energy storage demonstration projects because storage is critical for achieving Rhode Island's clean energy future, as it provides the ability to optimise system performance over time and allows intermittent renewable resources to make a larger contribution to the State's overall energy supply mix.\n\n## Rhode Island Aquidneck Island gas service/uni00A0interruption\n\nOn 21 January 2019, we suffered a significant loss of gas supply to the distribution system that serves our customers on Aquidneck Island in Rhode Island. As a result, we made the decision to interrupt the gas service to the Aquidneck Island system to protect the safety of our customers and the public. Overall, approximately 7,500 customers lost their gas service. On 23 September 2020, we published a long-term capacity study for energy solutions for Aquidneck Island for stakeholder feedback. The/uni00A0Company has since gathered extensive stakeholder feedback regarding a long-term solution for Aquidneck Island and has identified the solution, which it shared with stakeholders in/uni00A0October 2021.\n\n## Power Sector Transformation/Advanced Metering Functionality and Grid Modernisation Plan\n\nOn 27 November 2017, we filed a Power Sector Transformation (PST) Vision and Implementation Plan (PST Plan) in conjunction with our combined gas and electric rate case. The PST Plan proposed a suite of investments, including the full deployment of Advanced Metering Functionality (AMF) and grid modernisation investments. On 21 January 2021, following more than two years of extensive collaboration with regulators and key stakeholders, we filed an Updated AMF Business Case and GMP with the RIPUC. The Updated AMF Business Case provides a detailed plan to provide customers with greater control, choice and convenience in their energy consumption through the full-scale deployment of approximately 525,000 electric AMF meters, 277,000 gas modules and the associated communications network. GMP presents a 5-year implementation plan, and a/uni00A010-year roadmap of investments necessary to/uni00A0manage the electric distribution grid more granularly considering a range of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) adoption levels through 2030, as well as a comprehensive cost benefit analysis. Cost recovery for the specific projects and programmes in the GMP will be separately requested as part of future Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability (ISR Plans) or rate cases. Pursuant to written order issued on 14 July 2021, the RIPUC stayed the AMF and GMP proceedings pending further consideration following the issuance of a final order by the Division on the PPL Transaction. The RIPUC did not rule on whether or not to consolidate the matters.\n\n## Infrastructure, Safety and Reliability Plans\n\nFY 2023 Gas and Electric ISR Plans were filed on 17 and 20 December 2021 respectively for effect 1 April 2022. The Electric ISR Plan proposed capital spending of $104.8 million, plus $13.2 million for total operation and maintenance expenses. The Gas ISR Plan proposed total capital spending of $175.66 million. The RIPUC approved the Gas and Electric ISR Plans on 29 March 2022. There will be a further hearing for the Gas ISR Plan on one issue on 1 June 2022. The RIPUC's ruling on the Electric ISR Plan required the Company to review all distributed generation (DG) projects for which the CIAC did not cover the full cost of the project, reasons why, impact on rate base and associated revenue requirement. The Company is required to file a report on this by/uni00A01 August 2022.\n\n## COVID-19 response in Rhode Island\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 emergency, effective on 16 March 2020, the RIPUC ordered all electric and natural gas utilities to immediately cease certain collection activities, including termination of service for non-payment. On 13 July 2020, the RIPUC, after finding that an emergency still existed for customers eligible for the low-income rate, extended the moratorium on utility shut-offs until 1 November 2020 for customers qualifying for a low-income discount and until 30 September 2020 for remaining residential customers of National Grid. All COVID-19-related moratoria have now expired,/uni00A0and the Company has resumed collection activities.\n\n## Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\n\n## Complaints on New England transmission allowed RoE\n\nIn September 2011, December 2012, July 2014 and April 2016, a series of four complaints were filed with FERC against certain transmission owners, including our New England electricity transmission business. These complaints aimed to lower the base RoE, which FERC had authorised at 11.14% prior to the first complaint. FERC issued orders resolving only the first complaint, with the last order in March 2015, lowering the base RoE to 10.57%. A number of/uni00A0parties, including the Company, appealed FERC's order on the first complaint to the US federal court. On 14 April 2017, the court vacated FERC's order and remanded the first complaint back to FERC. This required FERC to/uni00A0reconsider the methodology it adopted in its/uni00A0order. On 5 June 2017, the New England Transmission Owners (NETOs), including the Company, submitted a filing to FERC to document the reinstatement of their transmission rates that had been in effect on 15 October 2014. FERC denied this filing and stated that, until further notice, the base RoE in New England must remain at the filed rate of 10.57%. On 6 November 2017, the NETOs, including the Company, sought rehearing of the FERC order denying the filing to reinstate their transmission rates that previously had been in effect.",

        "page_content": "## The business in detail continued\n\nOn/uni00A028 August 2020, after determining that this rehearing request had been deemed denied, the NETOs, including the Company, appealed to a/uni00A0US federal court FERC's order denying the filing to reinstate their transmission rates that previously had been in effect. On 2 October 2020, in response to an unopposed motion by FERC, the US federal court held this appeal in abeyance for four months.\n\nOn 16 October 2018, FERC issued a Preliminary Order Directing Brief on our four New England RoE complaints. In this order, FERC proposed a/uni00A0new methodology for determining whether an existing RoE remains just and reasonable and also for determining a new RoE where an existing RoE is found to be unjust and unreasonable. FERC also proposed to set the base RoE in New/uni00A0England at 10.41% with a 13.08% cap on incentives. Briefs were due in January 2019 and responses to the briefs were filed on 8 March\n\n2019. FERC is under no deadline to act on the briefs and it is too early to determine when or how FERC will come to a/uni00A0decision.\n\nOn 21 November 2019, FERC issued an order addressing customer complaints involving the transmission RoE for the transmission owners in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator region (MISO TOs). FERC issued an order on rehearing addressing the initial order on 21 May 2020. On 19 November 2020, FERC issued a/uni00A0further order on rehearing reaching the same result as the 21 May 2020 order. In those orders, FERC adopted a revised methodology for determining base RoEs for the MISO TOs. This differed significantly from the methodology and framework set forth in its 16 October 2018 Preliminary Order, which proposed a new RoE/uni00A0methodology in the dockets covering the/uni00A0four RoE complaints against the NETOs. On/uni00A023 December 2019, the NETOs filed\n\n## Summary of US price controls and rate plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                |

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives; however, their effectiveness has limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.\n\nEven effective disclosure controls and procedures provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on the evaluation, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required for disclosure in the reports that we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarised and reported as and when required and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\n\n## Internal control over financial/uni00A0reporting\n\nOur management, including the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, have carried out an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance\n\nand Transparency Rules sourcebook and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. As/uni00A0required by Section 404, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a)-5(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting is/uni00A0designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and/uni00A0the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or/uni00A0that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement's evaluation of the effectiveness of/uni00A0the Company's internal control over financial reporting was based on the revised Internal Control-Integrated Framework 2013 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Using this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 31 March 2022.\n\n## Risk factors\n\n## Law, regulation and political and economic uncertainty\n\nChanges in law or regulation, or decisions by governmental bodies or regulators and increased political and economic uncertainty, could materially adversely affect us.\n\nMost of our businesses are utilities or networks subject to regulation by governments and other authorities. Changes in law or regulation or regulatory policy and precedent (including changes arising as a result of the UK's exit from the European Union), as well as legislation introduced to facilitate the attainment of net zero emissions targets, and decisions of governmental bodies or regulators in the countries or states in which we operate could materially adversely affect us. We may fail to deliver any one of our customer, investor and wider stakeholder propositions due to increased political and economic uncertainty.\n\nIf we fail to respond to or meet our own commitments as a leader in relation to climate change and the energy transition, we may be unable to influence future energy policy and deliver our strategy.\n\nDeloitte LLP, which has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDuring the year, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) and general ledger system in the UK for ET and GT, resulting in changes to our reporting system; subject to/uni00A0that, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to/uni00A0materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Risk factors\n\nManagement of our risks is an important part of our internal control environment, as we describe on pages 28 - 32. In addition to the principal risks listed, we face a number of inherent risks that could have a material adverse effect on our/uni00A0business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation, as well as the value and liquidity of our securities.\n\nAny investment decision regarding our securities and any forward-looking statements made by us/uni00A0should be considered in the light of these risk factors and the cautionary statement set out on page 288. An overview of the key inherent risks we face is provided below.\n\nDecisions or rulings concerning the following (as examples) could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows, the financial condition of/uni00A0our businesses and the ability to develop those businesses in the future:\n\n- \u00b7  the determination and implementation of the RIIO-T2 and RIIO-ED2 price controls; whether licences, approvals or agreements to operate or supply are granted, amended or renewed; whether consents for construction projects are granted in a timely manner; or whether there has been any breach of the terms of a licence, approval or regulatory requirement; and\n- \u00b7  timely recovery of incurred expenditure or obligations; the ability to pass through commodity costs; a decoupling of energy usage and revenue, and other decisions relating to the impact of general economic conditions on us, our markets and customers; implications of climate change and of advancing energy technologies; whether aspects of our activities are contestable; and the level of permitted revenues and dividend distributions for our businesses and in relation to proposed business development activities.\n\nFor further information, see pages 245- 252, which explain our regulatory environment in detail.",

        "page_content": "## Internal control and risk factors continued\n\n## Potentially harmful activities\n\nAspects of the work we do could potentially harm employees, contractors, members of the public or the environment.\n\nPotentially hazardous activities that arise in connection with our business include: the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; and the storage, transmission and distribution of gas. Electricity and gas utilities also typically use and generate hazardous and potentially hazardous products and by-products. In addition, there may be other aspects of our operations that are not currently regarded or proved to have adverse effects but could become so, such as the effects of electric and magnetic fields.\n\nA significant safety or environmental incident, or the failure of our safety processes or of our occupational health plans, as well as the breach of our regulatory or contractual obligations or our climate change targets, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.\n\nSafety is a fundamental priority for us, and we commit significant resources and/uni00A0expenditure to ensuring process safety; to monitoring personal safety, occupational health and environmental performance; and to meeting our obligations under negotiated settlements.\n\n## Infrastructure and IT systems\n\nWe may suffer a major network failure or interruption, or may not be able to carry out critical operations due to the failure of infrastructure, data or technology or a lack of supply.\n\nOperational performance could be materially adversely affected by: a failure to/uni00A0maintain the health of our assets or networks; inadequate forecasting of demand and inadequate record keeping or control of data or failure of information systems and supporting technology. This, in turn, could cause us to fail to meet agreed standards of service, incentive and reliability targets, or be in breach of a licence, approval, regulatory requirement or contractual obligation. Even incidents that do not amount to a breach could result in adverse regulatory and financial consequences, as well as harming our reputation.\n\nWhere demand for electricity or gas exceeds supply, including where we do not adequately forecast and respond to disruptions in energy supplies, and our balancing mechanisms are not able to mitigate this fully, a lack of supply to consumers may damage our reputation.\n\nIn addition to these risks, we may be affected by other potential events that are largely outside our control, weather (including as a result of climate change and major storms), unlawful or unintentional acts of third parties, insufficient or unreliable supply, or force majeure.\n\n## Pandemics\n\n## We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks.\n\nAs seen in the context of COVID-19, pandemics and their associated counter-measures may affect countries, communities, supply chains and markets, including the UK and our service territory in the US. The spread of such pandemics could have adverse effects on our workforce, which could affect our ability to maintain our networks and provide service. In addition, disruption of supply chains could adversely affect our systems or networks.\n\nPandemics such as COVID-19 can also result in extraordinary economic circumstances in our markets which could negatively affect our customers' ability to pay our invoices in the US or the charges payable to the system operators for transmission services in the UK. Measures such as the suspension of debt collection and customer termination activities across our service area in response to such pandemics are likely to result in near-term lower customer collections, and could result in increasing levels of bad debt and associated provisions.\n\n## Business performance\n\nCurrent and future business performance may not meet our expectations or those of our regulators and shareholders.\n\nEarnings maintenance and growth from our regulated gas and electricity businesses will be affected by our ability to meet or exceed efficiency targets and service quality standards set by, or agreed with, our regulators.\n\nWe are subject to laws and regulations in the UK and US governing health and safety matters to protect the public and our employees and contractors, who could potentially be harmed by these activities, as well as laws and regulations relating to pollution, the protection of the environment, and the use and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials.\n\nThese expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and properties, including those inherited from predecessor bodies, whether currently or formerly owned by us, and sites used for the disposal of our waste.\n\nThe cost of future environmental remediation obligations is often inherently difficult to estimate, and uncertainties can include the extent of contamination, the appropriate corrective actions and our share of the liability. We are increasingly subject to regulation in relation to climate change and are affected by requirements to reduce our own carbon emissions (including our own commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050) as well as to enable reduction in energy use by our customers. If more onerous requirements are imposed or our ability to recover these costs under regulatory frameworks changes, this could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial position.\n\nWeather conditions can affect financial performance, and severe weather that causes outages or damages infrastructure, together with our actual or perceived response, could materially adversely affect operational and potentially business performance and our reputation.\n\nMalicious attack, sabotage or other intentional acts, including breaches of our/uni00A0cyber security, may also damage our assets (which include critical national infrastructure) or otherwise significantly affect corporate activities and, as a/uni00A0consequence, have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nUnauthorised access to, or deliberate breaches of, our IT systems may also lead to manipulation of our proprietary business data or customer information. Unauthorised access to private customer information may make us liable for a/uni00A0violation of data privacy regulations. Even where we establish business continuity controls and security against threats to our systems, these may not/uni00A0be sufficient.\n\nThe extent to which pandemics such as COVID-19 may affect our liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and will depend on the severity of the relevant pandemic, the scope, duration, cost to National Grid and overall economic impact of actions taken to contain it or treat its effects.\n\nIf we do not meet these targets and standards, or if we are not able to deliver our rate plans strategy successfully, we may not achieve the expected benefits, our business may be materially adversely affected and our performance, results of operations and reputation may be materially harmed and we may be in breach of regulatory or contractual obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Growth and business development activity\n\nFailure to respond to external market developments and execute our growth strategy may negatively affect our performance. Conversely, new businesses or activities that we undertake alone or with partners may not deliver target outcomes and may expose us to additional operational and financial risk.\n\nFailure to grow our core business sufficiently and have viable options for new future business over the longer term, or failure to respond to the threats and opportunities presented by emerging technology or innovation (including for the/uni00A0purposes of adapting our networks to meet the challenges of increasing distributed energy resources), could negatively affect the Group's credibility and/uni00A0reputation and jeopardise the achievement of intended financial returns.\n\nOur business development activities, including the WPD Acquisition, the NECO/uni00A0Sale, the NGGT Sale and the delivery of our growth ambition, involve acquisitions, disposals, joint ventures, partnering and organic investment opportunities, such as development activities relating to changes to the energy mix and the integration of distributed energy resources and other advanced technologies. These are subject to a wide range of both external uncertainties (including the availability of potential investment targets and attractive financing and the impact of competition for onshore transmission in both the UK and US) and internal uncertainties (including actual performance of our existing operating companies and our business planning model assumptions and ability to integrate acquired businesses effectively). As a result, we may suffer unanticipated costs and liabilities and other unanticipated effects.\n\n## Financing and liquidity\n\n## An inability to access capital markets at commercially acceptable interest rates could affect how we maintain and grow our businesses.\n\nOur businesses are financed through cash generated from our ongoing operations, bank lending facilities and the capital markets, particularly the long-term debt capital markets.\n\nSome of the debt we issue is rated by credit rating agencies, and changes to/uni00A0these ratings may affect both our borrowing capacity and borrowing costs. In/uni00A0addition, restrictions imposed by regulators may also limit how we service the/uni00A0financial requirements of our current businesses or the financing of newly acquired or developing businesses.\n\nFinancial markets can be subject to periods of volatility and shortages of liquidity, for example, as a result of unexpected political or economic events or/uni00A0the COVID-19 pandemic. If we were unable to access the capital markets or/uni00A0other sources of finance at commercially acceptable rates for a prolonged period, our cost of financing may increase, the discretionary and uncommitted elements of our proposed capital investment programme may need to be reconsidered, and the manner in which we implement our strategy may need to/uni00A0be reassessed.\n\nSuch events could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of/uni00A0operations and prospects.\n\nSome of our regulatory agreements impose lower limits for the long-term unsecured debt credit ratings that certain companies within the Group must hold or the amount of equity within their capital structures, including a limit requiring National Grid plc to hold an investment-grade long-term senior unsecured debt credit rating.\n\n## Exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price indices\n\n## Changes in foreign currency rates, interest rates or commodity prices could materially impact earnings or our financial condition.\n\nWe have significant operations in the US and are therefore subject to the exchange rate risks normally associated with non-UK operations including the need to translate US assets, liabilities, income and expenses into sterling (our reporting currency).\n\nWe may also be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities of companies or/uni00A0businesses we have acquired, which may be unforeseen or greater than anticipated. In the case of joint ventures, we may have limited control over operations and our joint venture partners may have interests that diverge from our own.\n\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition, and could also impact our ability to enter into other transactions.\n\nIn addition, some of our regulatory arrangements impose restrictions on the way/uni00A0we can operate. These include regulatory requirements for us to maintain adequate financial resources within certain parts of our operating businesses and may restrict the ability of National Grid plc and some of our subsidiaries to/uni00A0engage in certain transactions, including paying dividends, lending cash and/uni00A0levying charges.\n\nThe inability to meet such requirements, or the occurrence of any such restrictions, may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial/uni00A0condition.\n\nOur debt agreements and banking facilities contain covenants, including those relating to the periodic and timely provision of financial information by the issuing entity, restrictions on disposals and financial covenants, such as restrictions on the level of subsidiary indebtedness.\n\nFailure to comply with these covenants, or to obtain waivers of those requirements, could in some cases trigger a right, at the lender's discretion, to/uni00A0require repayment of some of our debt and may restrict our ability to draw upon our facilities or access the capital markets.\n\nIn addition, our results of operations and net debt position may be affected because a significant proportion of our borrowings, derivative financial instruments and commodity contracts are affected by changes in interest rates, commodity price indices and exchange rates, in particular the dollar-to-sterling exchange rate.\n\nFurthermore, our cash flow may be materially affected as a result of settling hedging arrangements entered into to manage our exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposure, or by cash collateral movements relating to derivative market values, which also depend on the sterling exchange rate into the euro and other currencies.",

In both the UK and US, such schemes include various large defined benefit schemes where the scheme assets are held independently of our own financial resources.\n\nIn the US, we also have other post-retirement benefit schemes. Estimates of the amount and timing of future funding for the UK and US schemes are based on actuarial assumptions and other factors, including: the actual and projected market performance of the scheme assets; future long-term bond yields; average life expectancies; and relevant legal requirements.\n\n## Customers and counterparties\n\n## Customers and counterparties may not perform their obligations.\n\nOur operations are exposed to the risk that customers, suppliers, banks and other financial institutions, and others with whom we do business, will not satisfy their obligations, which could materially adversely affect our financial/uni00A0position.\n\nThis risk is significant where our subsidiaries have concentrations of receivables from gas and electricity utilities and their affiliates, as well as industrial customers and other purchasers, and may also arise where customers are unable to pay us as a result of increasing commodity prices or adverse economic conditions.\n\n## Employees and others\n\nWe may fail to attract, develop and retain employees with the competencies (including leadership and business capabilities), values/uni00A0and behaviours required to deliver our strategy and vision and/uni00A0ensure they are engaged to act in our best interests.\n\nOur ability to implement our strategy depends on the capabilities and performance of our employees and leadership at all levels of the business. Our/uni00A0ability to implement our strategy and vision may be negatively affected by the loss of key personnel or an inability to attract, integrate, engage and retain appropriately qualified personnel (including people with the skills to help us deliver on our net zero commitments) or if significant disputes arise with our/uni00A0employees.\n\n## Index to Directors' Report and other disclosures\n\n| AGM                                                             | 258               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Articles of Association                                         | 257               |\n| Audit information                                               | 135 - 146         |\n| Board of Directors                                              | 88 - 89           |\n| Business model                                                  | 4 - 7             |\n| Change of control provisions                                    | 262               |\n| Code of Ethics                                                  | 262               |\n| Conflicts of interest                                           | 262               |\n| Directors' indemnity                                            | 262               |\n| Directors' service contracts and letters  of/uni00A0appointment | 127               |\n| Directors' share interests                                      | 118               |\n| Diversity                                                       | 65 - 66           |\n| Dividends                                                       | 9, 11, 49 and 287 |\n| Events after the reporting period                               | 49, 234 and 258   |\n\n| Financial instruments                                          | 187                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Future developments                                            | 20 - 21               |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions                                       | 26                    |\n| Human rights                                                   | 263                   |\n| Important events affecting the Company  during/uni00A0the year | 15 - 21               |\n| Internal control                                               | 28 - 32               |\n| Internal control over financial reporting                      | 253                   |\n| Listing Rule 9.8.4 R cross-reference table                     | 263                   |\n| Material interests in shares                                   | 259                   |\n| Colleagues                                                     | 65 - 66               |\n| Political donations and expenditure                            | 264                   |\n| Research, development and innovation activity                  | 22 - 23 and 264 - 267 |\n| Risk management                                                | 28 - 32               |\n| Share capital                                                  | 259                   |\n\nActual performance of scheme assets may be affected by volatility in debt and equity markets.\n\nChanges in these assumptions or other factors may require us to make additional contributions to these pension schemes which, to the extent they are/uni00A0not recoverable under our price controls or state rate plans, could materially adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition.\n\nTo the extent that counterparties are contracted with for physical commodities (gas and electricity) and they experience events that impact their own ability to deliver, we may suffer supply interruption as described in Infrastructure and IT systems on page 254.\n\nThere is also a risk to us where we invest excess cash or enter into derivatives and other financial contracts with banks or other financial institutions.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder information\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nThe following description is a summary of the material terms of our Articles of Association (Articles) and applicable English law. It is a/uni00A0summary only and is qualified in its entirety by/uni00A0reference to the Articles.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the Company's shareholders approved updated Articles which now take account of recent changes to company law and/uni00A0market changes, including in particular the/uni00A0flexibility for the Company to hold general meetings by allowing combined physical and electronic general meetings (also known as 'hybrid' meetings).\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Articles set out the Company's internal regulations. Copies are available on our website and upon request. Amendments to the Articles have to be approved by at least 75% of those voting at a general meeting of the Company. Subject to company law and the Articles, the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company. They may delegate authorities to committees and day-to-day management and decision making to individual Executive Directors. We set out the committee structure on/uni00A0page 91.\n\n## General\n\nThe Company is incorporated under the name National Grid plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 4031152. Under the Companies Act 2006, the Company's objects are unrestricted.\n\n## Directors\n\nUnder the Articles, a Director must disclose any personal interest in a matter and may not vote in respect of that matter, subject to certain limited exceptions. As permitted under the Companies Act 2006, the Articles allow non-conflicted Directors to authorise a conflict or potential conflict for a particular matter. In doing so, the non-conflicted Directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of the shareholders as a whole.\n\nThe Directors (other than a Director acting in an/uni00A0executive capacity) are paid fees for their services. In total, these fees must not exceed \u00a32,000,000 per year or any higher sum decided by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting of/uni00A0shareholders. In addition, special pay may be awarded to a Director who acts in an executive capacity, serves on a committee, performs services which the Directors consider to extend beyond the ordinary duties of a Director, devotes special attention to the business of National Grid, or goes or lives abroad on the Company's behalf. Directors may also receive reimbursement for expenses properly incurred, and may be awarded pensions and other benefits. The compensation awarded to the\n\nExecutive Directors is determined by the Remuneration Committee. Further details of/uni00A0Directors' remuneration are set out in the/uni00A0Directors' Remuneration Report (see pages/uni00A0108/uni00A0- 131.\n\nThe Directors may exercise all the powers of National Grid to borrow money. However, the aggregate principal amount of all the Group's borrowings outstanding at any time must not exceed \u00a355 billion or any other amount approved by shareholders by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting.\n\nDirectors can be appointed or removed by the Board or shareholders at a general meeting. Directors must stand for election at the first AGM following their appointment to the Board and the Articles provide, in line with market practice, that they must be recommended by the Board or the/uni00A0Company must have received written confirmation of their willingness to act as Director. Each Director must retire at least every three years, although they will be eligible for re-election. In accordance with best practice introduced by the UK Corporate Governance Code, all Directors wishing to continue in office currently offer themselves for re-election annually. No person is disqualified from being a/uni00A0Director or is required to vacate that office by reason of attaining a maximum age.\n\nA Director is not required to hold shares in National Grid plc in order to qualify as a Director.\n\n## Rights, preferences and restrictions (i) Dividend rights\n\nNational Grid may not pay any dividend otherwise than out of profits available for distribution under the Companies Act 2006 and other applicable provisions of English law. In addition, as a public company, National Grid may only make a distribution if, at the time of the distribution, the amount of its net assets is not less than the aggregate of its called-up share capital and undistributable reserves (as defined in the Companies Act 2006), and to the extent that the distribution does not reduce the amount of those assets to less than that aggregate. Ordinary shareholders and American Depositary Share (ADS) holders receive dividends.\n\nSubject to these points, shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the shareholders, but not exceeding the amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends if it considers that National Grid's financial position justifies the payment. Any dividend or interest unclaimed for 12 years from the date when it was declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and revert to National Grid, and the Articles clarify that the Company may use such unclaimed dividends for/uni00A0the Company's benefit as the Directors may/uni00A0think fit.\n\n## (ii) Voting rights\n\nSubject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares and to any other provisions of the Articles, at any general meeting on a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person will have one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder will have one vote for every share they hold. On a show of hands or poll, shareholders may cast votes either personally or/uni00A0by proxy. A proxy need not be a shareholder. Under the Articles, all substantive resolutions at a general meeting must be decided on a poll and the Articles further provide that voting on resolutions at a general meeting that is held at least in part using an electronic platform must be decided on a poll. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders can vote at general meetings.\n\n## (iii) Liquidation rights\n\nIn a winding up, a liquidator may (in each case with the sanction of a special resolution passed by the shareholders and any other sanction required under English law): (a) divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of National Grid's assets (whether the assets are of the same kind or not); the liquidator may, for this purpose, value any assets and determine how the division should be carried out as between shareholders or different classes of shareholders, or (b) transfer any part of the assets to Trustees on trust for the benefit of the shareholders as the/uni00A0liquidator determines. In neither case will a/uni00A0shareholder be compelled to accept assets upon which there is a liability.\n\n## (iv) Restrictions\n\nThere are no restrictions on the transfer or sale of ordinary shares. Some of the Company's employee share plans, details of which are contained in the Directors' Remuneration Report, include restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares while the ordinary shares are subject to the plan. Where, under an employee share plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of the ordinary shares but not the registered owner, the voting rights may be exercised by the registered owner at the direction of the participant. Treasury shares do not attract a vote or dividends.\n\n## (v) Variation of rights\n\nSubject to applicable provisions of English law, the rights attached to any class of shares of National Grid may be varied or cancelled. This must be with the written consent of the holders of three quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholder information continued\n\n## General meetings\n\nAGMs must be convened each year within six months of the Company's accounting reference date upon 21 clear days' advance written notice. Under the Articles, any other general meeting may be convened provided at least 14 clear days' written notice is given, subject to annual approval of shareholders. In certain limited circumstances, the Company can convene a/uni00A0general meeting by shorter notice. The notice must specify, among other things, the nature of/uni00A0the business to be transacted, the place, the date and the time of the meeting. The 2022 AGM will be held as a hybrid meeting. Please ensure you continue to monitor our website at nationalgrid.com/investors for any updates to the arrangements for the AGM.\n\n## Rights of non-residents\n\nThere are no restrictions under the Articles that would limit the rights of persons not resident in the UK to vote in relation to ordinary shares.\n\n## Disclosure of interests\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, National Grid may, by written notice, require a person whom it has reasonable cause to believe to be or to have been, in the last three years, interested in its shares to provide additional information relating to that interest. Under the Articles, failure to provide such information may result in a/uni00A0shareholder losing their rights to attend, vote/uni00A0or exercise any other right in relation to shareholders' meetings.\n\nUnder the UK Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) sourcebook, there is also an obligation on a person who acquires or ceases to have a notifiable interest in shares in National Grid to notify the Company of that fact. The disclosure threshold is 3% and disclosure is required each time the person's direct and indirect holdings reach, exceed or fall below each 1% threshold thereafter.\n\nThe UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers imposes strict disclosure requirements regarding dealings in the securities of an offeror or offeree company, and also on their respective associates, during the course of an offer period. Other regulators in the UK, US and elsewhere may have, or assert, notification or approval rights over acquisitions or transfers of shares.\n\n## Depositary payments to the/uni00A0Company\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon (the 'Depositary') reimburses the Company for certain expenses it/uni00A0incurs in relation to the ADS programme. The Depositary also pays the standard out-of-pocket maintenance costs for the ADSs, which consist of the expenses for the mailing of annual and interim financial reports, printing and distributing\n\ndividend cheques, the electronic filing of US federal tax information, mailing required tax forms, stationery, postage, facsimiles and telephone calls. It also reimburses the Company for certain investor relationship programmes or special investor relations promotional activities. There are limits on the amount of expenses for which the Depositary will reimburse the Company, but the amount of reimbursement is not necessarily tied to the amount of fees the Depositary collects from investors.\n\nFor the period 19 May 2021 to 18 May 2022, the Company received a total of $1,862,578.41 in reimbursements from the Depositary consisting of $323,055.00, $1,017,402.60 and $522,120.81 received in June 2021, October 2021 and January 2022 respectively. Fees that/uni00A0are charged on cash dividends will be apportioned between the Depositary and the/uni00A0Company.\n\nAny questions from ADS holders should be directed to the Depositary at the contact details on page 287.\n\n## Documents on display\n\nNational Grid is subject to the US Securities and/uni00A0Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements for foreign companies. The Company's Form 20-F and other filings can be viewed on the National Grid website as well as the SEC website at sec.gov .\n\n## Description of securities other than equity securities: depositary fees and charges\n\nThe Depositary collects fees by deducting them from the amounts distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property for:\n\n- \u00b7  delivery and surrender of ADSs directly from investors depositing shares or surrendering ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal or from intermediaries acting for them; and\n- \u00b7  making distributions to investors (including, it is expected, cash dividends).\n\nThe Depositary may generally refuse to provide fee-attracting services until its fees for those services are paid.\n\nThe Company's Deposit agreement under which the ADSs are issued allows a fee of up to $0.05 per ADS to be charged for any cash distribution made to ADS holders, including cash dividends. ADS holders who receive cash in relation to the 2021/22 final dividend will be charged a fee of $0.02 per ADS by the Depositary prior to distribution of the cash dividend.\n\n| Persons depositing or withdrawing shares must pay:                                                                                                                                          | For:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| $5.00 per 100 ADSs  (or portion of 100 ADSs)                                                                                                                                                | Issuance of ADSs, including issuances resulting from  a distribution of shares or rights or other property;  cancellation of ADSs for the purpose of withdrawal,  including if the Deposit agreement terminates; and  distribution of securities distributed to holders of  deposited securities that are distributed by the  Depositary to ADS holders. |\n| Registration or transfer fees                                                                                                                                                               | Transfer and registration of shares on our share  register to or from the name of the Depositary or its  agent when they deposit or withdraw shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Expenses of the Depositary                                                                                                                                                                  | Cable, telex and facsimile transmissions (when  expressly provided in the Deposit agreement); and  converting foreign currency to dollars.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Taxes and other governmental charges the Depositary or  the Custodian has to pay on any ADS or share underlying  an ADS, for example stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or  withholding taxes | As necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n## Events after the reporting period\n\nThere were no events after the reporting period.\n\n## Exchange controls\n\nThere are currently no UK laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of/uni00A0capital, including, but not limited to, foreign exchange control restrictions, or that affect the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-UK resident holders of ordinary shares except as otherwise set out in Taxation on pages 260 and 261 and except in respect of/uni00A0the governments of and/or certain citizens, residents or bodies of certain countries (described in applicable Bank of England Notices or European Union Council Regulations in force as at the date of this document).\n\n## Share information\n\nNational Grid ordinary shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol NG.

        "page_content": "## Material interests in shares\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, National Grid had been notified of the following holdings in voting rights of/uni00A03% or more in the issued share capital of the Company:\n\n|                                   | Number of ordinary  shares   |   % of voting rights 1 | Date of last notification  of interest   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| BlackRock, Inc.                   | 255,529,542                  |                   7.04 | 6 December 2021                          |\n| The Capital Group Companies, Inc. | 184,152,007                  |                   5.05 | 26 January 2022                          |\n\nAs at 18 May 2022, no further notifications have been received.\n\nThe rights attached to ordinary shares are detailed on page 257. All ordinary shares and all major shareholders have the same voting rights. The Company is not, to the best of its knowledge, directly or indirectly controlled.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAs at 18 May 2022, the share capital of the Company consists of ordinary shares of 12 204/473 pence nominal value each and ADSs, which represent five ordinary shares each.\n\n## Authority to purchase shares\n\nShareholder approval was given at the 2021 AGM to purchase up to 10% of the Company's share capital (being 355,533,053 ordinary shares). The Directors intend to seek shareholder approval to renew this authority at the 2022 AGM.\n\nIn some circumstances, the Company may find it advantageous to have the authority to purchase its own shares in the market, where the Directors believe this would be in the interests of shareholders generally. The Directors believe that it is an important part of the financial management of the Company to have the flexibility to repurchase issued shares to manage its capital base, including actively managing share issuances from the operation of the scrip dividend scheme. It is expected that repurchases to manage share issuances under the scrip dividend scheme will not exceed 2.5% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) per annum.\n\nWhen purchasing shares, the Company has taken, and will continue to take, into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment and financing opportunities, and the overall financial position of the Company.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the Company sought authority to purchase ordinary shares in the capital of the Company as part of the management of the dilutive effect of share issuances under the scrip dividend scheme. During the year, the Company did not purchase any of its own shares.\n\n|                                                                                                            | Number of shares   | Total nominal value   | % of called up share  capital   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Shares held in Treasury purchased  in/uni00A0prior/uni00A0years 1                                          | 265,759,757        | \u00a333,037,365.14\u00b2       | 6.97\u00b9                           |\n| Shares purchased and held in Treasury  during/uni00A0the year                                              | -                  | -                     | -                               |\n| Shares transferred from Treasury during  the/uni00A0year (to employees under employee  share/uni00A0plans) | 6,628,537          | \u00a3824,012.63 2         | 0.17 3                          |\n| Maximum number of shares held in Treasury  during the year                                                 | 265,759,757        | \u00a333,037,365.14\u00b2       | 6.81 3                          |\n\n- 1.

Called-up share capital: 3,904,074,348 ordinary shares as at the date of this report.\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Company held 257,369,050 ordinary shares as treasury shares. This/uni00A0represented 6.59% of the Company's called-up share capital.\n\n## Authority to allot shares\n\nShareholder approval was given at the 2021 AGM to allot shares of up to one third of the Company's share capital. The Directors are seeking this same level of authority this year. The/uni00A0Directors consider that the Company will have sufficient flexibility with this level of authority to respond to market developments and that this/uni00A0authority is in line with investor guidelines.\n\nThe Directors currently have no intention of issuing new shares or of granting rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares. This is except in relation to, or in connection with, the operation and management of the Company's scrip dividend scheme and the exercise of options under the Company's share plans. No issue of shares will be made that would effectively alter control of the Company without the sanction of shareholders in a/uni00A0general/uni00A0meeting.\n\nThe Company expects to actively manage the dilutive effect of share issuance arising from the operation of the scrip dividend scheme. In some circumstances, additional shares may be allotted to the market for this purpose under the authority provided by this resolution. Under these circumstances, it is expected that the associated allotment of new shares (or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares) will not exceed 1% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) per annum.\n\n## Dividend waivers\n\nThe Trustee of the National Grid Employee Share Trust, which is independent of the Company, waived the right to dividends paid during the year. They have also agreed to waive the right to/uni00A0future dividends, in relation to the ordinary shares and ADSs held by the trust.\n\nUnder the Company's ADS programme, the right to dividends in relation to the ordinary shares underlying the ADSs was waived during the year, under an arrangement whereby the Company pays the monies to satisfy any dividends separately to the Depositary for distribution to ADS holders entitled to the dividend. This arrangement is expected to continue for future/uni00A0dividends.",

Percentages have been rounded to two decimal places.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThis section provides information about certain US federal income tax and UK tax consequences for US Holders (defined below) of owning ADSs and ordinary shares. A US Holder is the beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares/uni00A0who:\n\n- \u00b7  is for US federal income tax purposes (i) an individual citizen or resident of the US; (ii) a corporation created or organised under the laws of the US, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax without regard to its source; or (iv) a trust, if/uni00A0a/uni00A0court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of/uni00A0the trust and one or more US persons have/uni00A0the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be treated as a domestic trust for US federal income tax purposes;\n- \u00b7  is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes; and\n- \u00b7  does not hold ADSs or ordinary shares in connection with the conduct of a business or the performance of services in the UK or otherwise in connection with a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK.\n\nThis section is not a comprehensive description of all the US federal income tax and UK tax considerations that may be relevant to any particular investor (including consequences under the US alternative minimum tax or net investment income tax). Neither does it address state, local or other tax laws. National Grid has assumed that shareholders, including US Holders, are familiar with the tax rules applicable to investments in securities generally and with any special rules to which they may be subject. This discussion deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets. It/uni00A0does not address the tax treatment of investors who are subject to special rules. Such investors may include:\n\n- \u00b7  financial institutions;\n- \u00b7  insurance companies;\n- \u00b7  dealers in securities or currencies;\n- \u00b7  investors who elect mark-to-market treatment;\n- \u00b7  entities treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities and their partners;\n- \u00b7  individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts;\n- \u00b7  tax-exempt organisations;\n- \u00b7  investors who own (directly or indirectly) 10% or more of our shares (by vote or value);\n- \u00b7  investors who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as a position in a straddle, hedging transaction or conversion transaction;\n- \u00b7  individual investors who have ceased to be resident in the UK for a period of five years or/uni00A0less;\n- \u00b7  persons that have ceased to be US citizens or/uni00A0lawful permanent residents of the US; and\n- \u00b7  US Holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar.\n\nThe statements regarding US and UK tax laws and administrative practices set forth below are based on laws, treaties, judicial decisions and regulatory interpretations that were in effect on the date of this document. These laws and practices are subject to change without notice, potentially with retroactive effect. In addition, the statements set forth below are based on the representations of the Depositary and assume that each party to the Deposit agreement will perform its obligations thereunder in accordance with its terms.\n\nUS Holders of ADSs generally will be treated as the owners of the ordinary shares represented by those ADSs for US federal income tax purposes. For the purposes of the Tax Convention, the Estate Tax Convention and UK/uni00A0tax considerations, this discussion assumes that a US Holder of ADSs will be treated as the owner of the ordinary shares represented by those ADSs. HMRC has stated that it will continue to apply its long-standing practice of/uni00A0treating a holder of ADSs as holding the beneficial interest in the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs; however, we note that/uni00A0this is an area of some uncertainty and may/uni00A0be subject to change.\n\nUS Holders should consult their own advisors regarding the tax consequences of buying, owning and disposing of ADSs or ordinary shares depending on their particular circumstances, including the effect of any state, local or other tax laws.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\nThe UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid to US Holders.\n\nUS Holders should assume that any cash distribution paid by us with respect to ADSs or/uni00A0ordinary shares will be reported as dividend income for US federal income tax purposes. While dividend income received from non-US corporations is generally taxable to a noncorporate US Holder as ordinary income for US federal income tax purposes, dividend income received by a non-corporate US Holder from us generally will be taxable at the same favourable rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided (i) either: (a) we are eligible for the benefits of the Tax Convention or (b) ADSs or ordinary shares are treated as 'readily tradable' on an established securities market in the US; and (ii) we are not, for our taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the prior year, a/uni00A0passive foreign investment company for US federal income tax purposes (a PFIC), and certain other requirements are met. We expect that our shares will be treated as 'readily tradable' on an established securities market in/uni00A0the US as a result of the trading of ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange. We also believe we are eligible for the benefits of the Tax/uni00A0Convention.\n\nBased on our audited financial statements and the nature of our business activities, we believe that we were not treated as a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes with respect to our taxable year ended 31 March 2022. In addition, based on our current expectations regarding the value and nature of our assets, the sources and nature of our income and the nature of our business activities, we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future.\n\nDividends received by corporate US Holders with respect to ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction that is generally allowed to corporations.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nSubject to specific rules relating to assets that derive at least 75% of their value from UK land, US Holders will not be subject to UK taxation on any capital gain realised on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares.\n\nProvided that we are not a PFIC for any taxable year during which a US Holder holds their ADSs/uni00A0or ordinary shares, upon a sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares, a US Holder generally will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes that is equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on the sale or other disposition and the US Holder's adjusted tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term",

        "page_content": "capital gain or loss if the ADSs or ordinary shares were held for more than one year. For noncorporate US Holders, long-term capital gain is generally taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. A US Holder's ability to deduct capital losses is subject to significant limitations.\n\n## US information reporting and backup withholding tax\n\nDividend payments made to US Holders and proceeds paid from the sale, exchange, redemption or disposal of ADSs or ordinary shares to US Holders may be subject to information reporting to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Such payments may be subject to backup withholding taxes if the US Holder fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or/uni00A0fails/uni00A0to comply with applicable certification/uni00A0requirements.\n\nUS Holders should consult their tax advisors about these rules and any other reporting obligations that may apply to the ownership or/uni00A0disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares. Such/uni00A0obligations include reporting requirements related to the holding of certain foreign financial/uni00A0assets.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT)\n\n## Transfers of ordinary shares\n\nSDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration will generally be payable on any agreement to transfer ordinary shares that is not completed using a duly stamped instrument of transfer (such as a stock transfer form).\n\nThe SDRT liability will be cancelled where an instrument of transfer is executed and duly stamped before the expiry of the six-year period beginning with the date on which the agreement is made. If a claim is made within the specified period, any SDRT which has been paid will be refunded. SDRT is due whether or not the agreement or transfer is made or carried out in the UK and whether or not any party to that agreement or transfer is a UK resident.\n\nPurchases of ordinary shares completed using a/uni00A0stock transfer form will generally result in a UK stamp duty liability at the rate of 0.5% (rounded up to the nearest \u00a35) of the amount or value of the consideration. Paperless transfers under the/uni00A0CREST paperless settlement system will generally be liable to SDRT at the rate of 0.5%, and not stamp duty. SDRT is generally the liability of the purchaser, and UK stamp duty is/uni00A0usually paid by the purchaser or transferee.\n\n## Transfers of ADSs\n\nNo UK stamp duty will be payable on the acquisition or transfer of existing ADSs or beneficial ownership of ADSs (in each case in the form of American Depositary Receipts), provided that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is executed outside the UK and remains at all times outside the UK.\n\nAn agreement for the transfer of ADSs in the form of American Depositary Receipts will not result in an SDRT liability. A charge to stamp duty or SDRT may arise on the transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary or The Bank of/uni00A0New York Mellon as agent of the Depositary (the 'Custodian').\n\nThe rate of stamp duty or SDRT will generally be 1.5% of the value of the consideration or, in some circumstances, the value of the ordinary shares concerned. However, there is no 1.5% SDRT charge on the issue of ordinary shares (or, where it is integral to the raising of new capital, the transfer of ordinary shares) to the Depositary or the Custodian.\n\nThe Depositary will generally be liable for the stamp duty or SDRT. Under the terms of the Deposit agreement, the Depositary will charge any tax payable by the Depositary or the Custodian (or their nominees) on the deposit of ordinary shares to the party to whom the ADSs are delivered against such deposits. If the stamp duty is not a multiple of \u00a35, the duty will be rounded up to the nearest multiple of \u00a35.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nAn individual who is domiciled in the US for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention and who is not a UK national for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of (i) the ADSs or ordinary shares on the individual's death or (ii) a gift of the ADSs or ordinary shares during the individual's lifetime. This is not the case where the ADSs or ordinary shares are part of/uni00A0the business property of the individual's permanent establishment in the UK or relate to a/uni00A0fixed base in the UK of an individual who performs independent personal services.\n\nSpecial rules apply to ADSs or ordinary shares held in trust.\n\nIn the exceptional case where the ADSs or shares are subject both to UK inheritance tax and to US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for the tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax paid in the US or vice versa.\n\n## Capital gains tax (CGT) for UK resident shareholders\n\nYou can find CGT information relating to National Grid shares for UK resident shareholders on the Investors section of our website. Share prices on specific dates are also available on our website.",

        "page_content": "## Other disclosures\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nThe Company has a number of all-employee share plans as described below, which operated during the year. These allow UK- or US-based employees to participate in tax-advantaged plans and to become shareholders in National Grid.\n\n## Sharesave\n\nUK employees are eligible to participate in the Sharesave plan. Under this plan, participants may contribute between \u00a35 and \u00a3500 each month, for a fixed period of three years, five years or both. Contributions are taken from net salary. At the end of the fixed period, participants may use their savings to purchase ordinary shares in National Grid at a 20% discounted option price, which is set at the time of each annual Sharesave launch.\n\n## Share Incentive Plan (SIP)\n\nUK employees are eligible to participate in the SIP. Contributions up to \u00a3150 per month are deducted from participants' gross salary and used to purchase National Grid ordinary shares each month. The shares are placed in a UK resident trust and are available to the individual with tax advantages after a five-year period.\n\n## US Incentive Thrift Plan\n\nThe Thrift Plan is open to all US employees of participating National Grid companies; this is a/uni00A0tax-advantaged savings plan (commonly referred to as a 401k plan). This is a defined contribution (DC) pension plan that gives participants the opportunity to invest up to applicable federal salary limits. The federal limits for calendar year 2021 were: for pre-tax contributions, a maximum of 50% of salary limited to $19,500 for those under the age of 50 and $26,000 for those aged 50 and above; and for post-tax contributions, up to 15% of salary. The total amount of employee contributions (pre-tax and post-tax) could not exceed 50% of/uni00A0compensation, and was further subject to the/uni00A0combined federal annual contribution limit of/uni00A0$58,000. For the calendar year 2022, participants may invest up to the applicable federal salary limits: for pre-tax contributions, this/uni00A0is a maximum of 50% of salary limited to $20,500 for those under the age of 50 and $27,000 for those aged 50 and above; for post-tax contributions, this is up to 15% of/uni00A0salary. The total amount of employee contributions (pre-tax and post-tax) may not exceed 50% of compensation, and is further subject to the combined federal annual contribution limit of $61,000.\n\n## US Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\nEmployees of National Grid's participating US companies are eligible to participate in the ESPP (commonly referred to as a 423b plan). Eligible employees have the opportunity to purchase ADSs in National Grid on a monthly basis at a/uni00A015% discounted price. Under the plan, employees may contribute up to 20% of base pay each year, up to a maximum annual contribution of $25,000, to purchase ADSs.\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\nNo compensation would be paid for loss of office of Directors on a change of control of the Company. As at 31 March 2022, the Company had borrowing facilities of \u00a34.7 billion available to it with a number of banks, which, on a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, may alter or terminate; however, the Company is currently not drawing on any of such borrowing facilities. All of the Company's share plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a/uni00A0change of control, subject to the satisfaction of/uni00A0any performance conditions at that time. In the event of a change of control of the Company, a/uni00A0number of governmental and regulatory consents or approvals are likely to be required, arising from laws or regulations of the UK or the US. Such consents or approvals may also be required for acquisitions of equity securities that do not amount to a change of control.\n\nNo other agreements that take effect, alter or/uni00A0terminate upon a change of control of the/uni00A0Company following a takeover bid are considered to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business as a whole.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nIn accordance with US legal requirements, the Board has adopted a Code of Ethics for senior financial professionals. This Code is available on/uni00A0our website (where any amendments or waivers will also be posted). There were no amendments to, or waivers of, our Code of Ethics during the year.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has a policy and procedure in place/uni00A0for the disclosure and authorisation (if/uni00A0appropriate) of actual and potential conflicts of/uni00A0interest. The Board continues to monitor and/uni00A0note possible conflicts of interest that each/uni00A0Director may have, including a review on/uni00A0appointment. The Directors are regularly reminded of their continuing obligations in relation to conflicts, and are required to review and confirm their external interests annually. During the year ended 31 March 2022, no new actual or potential conflicts of interest were identified that required approval by the Board. The Board has considered and noted a number of situations in relation to which no actual conflict of interest was identified.\n\n## Corporate governance practices: differences from New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards\n\nThe Company is listed on the NYSE and is therefore required to disclose differences in its corporate governance practices adopted as a/uni00A0UK listed company, compared with those of/uni00A0a/uni00A0US company. The corporate governance practices of the/uni00A0Company are primarily based on the requirements of the Corporate Governance Code 2018 but substantially conform to those required of US companies listed on the NYSE.\n\nThe following is a summary of the significant ways in which the Company's corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under Section 303A Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE.\n\nThe NYSE rules and the Code apply different tests for the independence of Board members.\n\nThe NYSE rules require a separate nominating/ corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. There is no requirement for a separate corporate governance committee in the UK. Under the Company's corporate governance policies, all Directors on the Board discuss and decide upon governance issues, and the People & Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board with regard to certain responsibilities of/uni00A0a/uni00A0corporate governance committee.\n\nThe NYSE rules require listed companies to adopt and disclose corporate governance guidelines. While the Company reports compliance with the Code in each Annual Report and Accounts, the UK requirements do not require the Company to adopt and disclose separate corporate governance guidelines.\n\nThe NYSE rules require a separate audit committee composed of at least three independent members. While the Company's Audit & Risk Committee exceeds the NYSE's minimum independent Non-executive Director membership requirements, it should be noted that the quorum for a meeting of the Audit & Risk Committee, of two independent Nonexecutive Directors, is less than the minimum membership requirements under the NYSE rules.\n\nThe NYSE rules require a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors, and prescribe criteria to evaluate the independence of the committee's members and its ability to engage external compensation advisors. While the Code prescribes different independence criteria, the Non-executive Directors on the Company's Remuneration Committee have each been deemed independent by the Board under the NYSE rules. Although the evaluation criteria for appointment of external advisors differ under the Code, the Remuneration Committee is solely responsible for the appointment, retention and termination of such advisors.\n\n## Directors' indemnity\n\nThe Company has arranged, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles, qualifying third-party indemnities against financial exposure that Directors may incur in the course of their professional duties. Equivalent qualifying third-party indemnities were, and remain, in force for the benefit of those Directors who stood down from the Board in prior financial years for matters arising when they were Directors of the Company. Alongside these indemnities, the Company places Directors' and Officers' liability insurance cover for each Director. To the extent appropriate and required, similar indemnities have also been given to directors of subsidiary and other associated companies, who also benefit from Directors' and Officers' liability insurance cover.",

It/uni00A0is/uni00A0our/uni00A0policy to maintain well developed communications and consultation programmes and there have been no material disruptions to our operations from labour disputes during the past three years. National Grid believes that it can conduct its relationships with trade unions and employees in/uni00A0a satisfactory manner. Further details on the Company's colleagues can be found on pages 65 and 66.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe launched our Responsible Business Charter in October 2020 focusing on five key areas. One of the areas is our people and our commitment to ensuring all our people are treated fairly and given the opportunity to thrive at work. As a responsible, purpose-led company, the way in which we conduct ourselves allows us to build trust with the people we work with by doing things in the right way, building our reputation as/uni00A0a responsible and ethical company that our stakeholders want to do business with and our employees want to work for.\n\nOur employees are at the heart of what we do, which is why we're proud to be one of 173 companies and one of 50 FTSE 100 companies who participated in the 2022 Workforce Disclosure Initiative which encourages transparency from companies on how they manage workers with the goal of improving the quality of jobs in company operations and supply chains. This year we improved our Scorecard rating to 86% overall, from 82% last year, and received a special mention in the supply chain data category.\n\nNational Grid does not have direct operations in countries of high concern with respect to human rights, therefore we do not have a specific policy relating to human rights. However, respect for/uni00A0human rights is incorporated into our employment practices and our values. We treat everyone fairly and equally, without discrimination. Respecting others and valuing DEI are integral to our Code of Ethics and we provide unconscious bias training to all our people to build awareness of cultural differences and the importance of diversity, and the necessity of/uni00A0achieving equity and inclusion. Our Global Supplier Diversity Policy outlines our commitments and expectation that DEI is embedded in all aspects of/uni00A0business in our supply chain.\n\nWe acknowledge that there may be potential risks in our wider supply chain, and we recognise that the relationship we have with our/uni00A0suppliers can influence how they support our/uni00A0commitment to acting responsibly.\n\nWe produce an annual Modern Slavery Statement which outlines the actions we take to/uni00A0assess potential risk in our wider operations and take actions to address this. This includes working collaboratively in the sector through a/uni00A0number of membership organisations to build awareness and capability in the supply chain. In/uni00A0the last Business and Human Rights Resource Centre Report assessing FTSE 100 modern\n\nslavery statements, we were recognised as one of a small cluster of leaders standing out. We publish our Statement on the Home Office modern slavery registry and encourage our suppliers to publish a statement on modern slavery regardless of whether this is a legal obligation to do so.\n\nWe are signatories to the UK Construction Protocol, which is a joint agreement with many of the largest firms in the UK construction sector focused on eradicating modern slavery and exploitation in the building industry. We are also/uni00A0founding signatory members of the People Matter Charter which was created to help organisations up and down the supply chain to bring challenges related to decent work together into one workforce strategy. The Charter has eight commitments that can apply to any organisation, of any size including aspects supporting human rights.\n\nWe are members of the UNGC Modern Slavery Working Group and take part in a peer review of/uni00A0our Modern Slavery Statement to share best practice and identify areas for improvement. We are actively involved in Utilities Against Slavery, which is a collaborative initiative aimed at working together to eradicate slavery and exploitation in the UK utilities sector and its supply chains. Through this we worked with the Supply Chain Sustainability School to deliver a/uni00A0series of six training session over six months to/uni00A0our shared network of suppliers.\n\nWe aim to maintain fairness across the organisation for pay and make sure our pay practices do not show bias. In the US, we pay all/uni00A0our employees at least the minimum wage or above the minimum wage requirements. In the UK, we are accredited Living Wage Foundation employers. Our commitment to our direct employees extends to our contractors and the work they do on behalf of National Grid and is actively promoted through our supply chain and embedded in our contract terms and conditions and contract management discussions. We believe that everyone should be appropriately rewarded for their time and effort. We also go\n\nabove the Living Wage Foundation accreditation requirements and voluntarily pay our trainees/ apprentices the real living wage. We undertake a/uni00A0real living wage review and produce a report to the Living Wage Foundation each year to ensure continued alignment. This includes an increase to individual internal salaries as required and annual communication of the new real living wage rates to our supply chain. We include a/uni00A0review of implementation of the real living wage/uni00A0in supply chain contracts where low wages could be a risk, including our catering, cleaning, waste management and main construction contracts.\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct is updated and communicated to our suppliers annually and clearly sets out our expectations to share our commitment to respecting, protecting and promoting human rights. This includes alignment to the UN Guiding Principles, the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) minimum standards, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code, the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act 2000, the US Department of State Principles Combatting Human Trafficking and, for our UK/uni00A0suppliers, the requirements of the Living Wage Foundation.\n\n## Unresolved SEC staff comments\n\nThere are no unresolved SEC staff comments required to be reported.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThis information can be found in Note 13 Property, plant and equipment on pages 180 182, Note 21 Borrowings on pages 192 - 194 and Where we operate on page 244.\n\n## Listing Rule 9.8.4 R cross-reference table\n\nInformation required to be disclosed by LR 9.8.4 R (starting on page indicated):\n\nInterest capitalised\n\nPage 167\n\n| Publication of unaudited financial information           | Not applicable         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Details of long-term incentive schemes                   | Pages 114, 128 and 130 |\n| Waiver of emoluments by a director                       | Not applicable         |\n| Waiver of future emoluments by a director                | Not applicable         |\n| Non-pre-emptive issues of equity for cash                | Not applicable         |\n| Item (7) in relation to major subsidiary undertakings    | None                   |\n| Parent participation in a placing by a listed subsidiary | Not applicable         |\n| Contracts of significance                                | Page 264               |\n| Provision of services by a controlling shareholder       | Not applicable         |\n| Shareholder waivers of dividends                         | Page 259               |\n| Shareholder waivers of future dividends                  | Page 259               |\n| Agreements with controlling shareholders                 | Not applicable         |",

        "page_content": "## Other disclosures continued\n\n## Political donations and expenditure\n\nAt this year's AGM, the Directors will again seek authority from shareholders, on a precautionary basis, for the Company and its subsidiaries to make donations to registered political parties and other political organisations and/or incur political expenditure as such terms are defined in/uni00A0the Companies Act 2006. In each case, donations will be in amounts not exceeding \u00a3125,000 in aggregate. The definitions of these terms in the Companies Act 2006 are very wide. As a result, this can cover bodies such as those concerned with policy review, law reform and the representation of the business community (for example trade organisations). It could include special interest groups, such as those involved with the environment, which the Company and its subsidiaries might wish to support, even though these activities are not designed to support or influence support for a particular party. The Companies Act 2006 states that all-party parliamentary groups are not political organisations for these purposes, meaning the authority to be sought from shareholders is not relevant to interactions with such groups. The Company has no intention of changing its current practice of not making political donations or incurring political expenditure within the ordinary meaning of those words. This authority is, therefore, being sought to ensure that none of/uni00A0the Company's activities inadvertently infringe these rules.\n\nNational Grid made no political donations and did not incur any political expenditure during the year, as such terms are defined for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. National Grid USA's affiliated New York and federal political action committees (PAC) made political donations in the US totalling $79,375 (\u00a358,796) during the year. National Grid USA's affiliated New York PAC (NYPAC) was funded partly by contributions from National Grid USA and certain of its subsidiaries and partly by voluntary employee contributions. National Grid USA's affiliated federal PAC was funded wholly by voluntary employee contributions. The NYPAC did not receive any corporate contribution during the past fiscal year.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nOn 17 March 2021, we agreed to buy WPD from PPL, and, conditional upon the completion of the WPD Acquisition and certain regulatory approvals, agreed to sell NECO to PPL. The share purchase agreements for the WPD Acquisition and the NECO sale, together with the sponsor agreement between the Company and Barclays Bank plc (Barclays) dated 31 March 2021 (pursuant to which the Company appointed Barclays as sponsor in connection with the WPD Acquisition and the publication of its shareholder circular for approval of the WPD Acquisition), as well as the acquisition facility dated 17 March 2021 required for the WPD Acquisition, comprising a \u00a38.25 billion term loan facility and a \u00a31.105 billion revolving loan facility term between the Company, Barclays and Goldman Sachs as lenders and lead arrangers, constitute material contracts for the Company.\n\nOn 27 March 2022, we also announced the sale of a 60% stake in our UK Gas Transmission (which owns and operates the gas transmission network across Great Britain) and UK metering business. We also entered into an option for the potential sale of the remaining 40% stake with the purchasing consortium. The acquisition agreement and the option agreement in connection with this transaction constitute material contracts for the Company.\n\nIn addition, each of our Executive Directors has a/uni00A0Service Agreement and each Non-executive Director has a Letter of Appointment. Apart from these, no contract (other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business) has been entered into by the Group within the two years immediately preceding the date of this report that is, or may be, material; or which contains any provision under which any member of the Group has any obligation or entitlement which is/uni00A0material to the Group at the date of this report.\n\n## Research, development and innovation activity\n\nInvestment in research and development during the year for the Group is outlined in Note 4 on page 162. We only disclose directly incurred expenditure, and not those amounts our partners contribute to joint or collaborative projects. Collaborating across the industry has played a crucial role in our ability to develop new/uni00A0programmes and deliver value to our stakeholders throughout 2021/22.\n\n## UK Electricity\n\nElectricity Transmission innovation has increased focus on meeting the UK's net zero 2050 targets. As a result, our project portfolio has been developed around the themes of delivering cleaner and cheaper energy. As the pace of climate change and its effects increase, we can expect the technology evolution and delivery of the energy transition to accelerate. Responding to this challenge will mean having to think very broadly about the art of the possible and engaging with other sectors; during 2021/22 we have identified five whole-system approach projects.\n\nCollaboration is a crucial part of the way we innovate in Electricity Transmission. Sharing and/uni00A0being open to new ideas from across industries and academia allows us to develop projects to transform energy systems and bring the greatest possible benefits to our customers, stakeholders and end consumers. For us, that involves finding the right specialist partners to work with us on the right challenges, while giving stakeholders plenty of time and opportunity to contribute and influence our decision making. We/uni00A0have therefore set up a new framework for a/uni00A0wider range of UK universities to work with us/uni00A0on delivering the energy transition and addressing consumer vulnerabilities.\n\nWe are partnered with the Energy Innovation Centre (EIC), which provides us with a forum to work together with other networks on common challenges that centre on SF6, vulnerable customers and net zero substations. Together with EIC, SPEN and SEE, we launched Call for Innovation 2021 for suppliers to showcase their\n\nideas for managing the existing SF6 inventory. Responses were received from several suppliers addressing improved leak detection, leak sealing and SF6/uni00A0capture.\n\nAdditionally, we have continued engaging with/uni00A0innovative organisations through our membership of the Infrastructure Industry Innovation Partnership (i3P). Its large network of/uni00A0experts and innovators is helping drive transformation within the infrastructure and construction industry to deliver infrastructure for/uni00A0the future.\n\nWe have been granted the Strategic Innovation Funding for a total of \u00a3400,000, to deliver the discovery phase of three projects to support network innovation that contributes to the achievement of net zero, while delivering real net/uni00A0benefits to network consumers.\n\nOfgem approved our business model for our Deeside Centre for Innovation in October 2021 and progress has been made with the construction of the OHL and substation area. Over the past 12 months, our innovation programme at the centre has included trialling three new innovative projects to cut harmful environmental emissions. From reducing SF6 from its pipework, to trialling a cement-free concrete, to capturing waste heat from electricity transformers to generate hot water and space heating for homes and businesses, these projects are another step forward on the journey to meet net zero targets by 2050. We are aiming to open the facility for wider industry use in October 2022.\n\nWe continue to progress innovative ideas into our business as usual practices particularly as the resilience requirements of electricity networks will need to evolve with a changing energy landscape as society adapts how it uses energy to meet the 2050 net zero decarbonisation target and national infrastructure sectors become increasingly interdependent. The outputs of our projects help to plan for future resilience requirements and effectively ensure the UK has a prepared robust transmission network.\n\n## WPD\n\nWPD's innovation project portfolio has been expanded to new areas, enabling it to work with/uni00A0industries it has never worked with before. Driven by the Group ambition to meet net zero and recognising that this cannot be delivered if/uni00A0there is no collaboration with other key industries, WPD has focused on increasing collaboration with crucial sectors that need to decarbonise to enable the UK meet its net zero targets. WPD has created and is delivering Network Innovation Allowance (NIA) projects in collaboration with water utilities, environmental management experts and leaders in climate change adaptation. WPD is proud to have started its largest NIA project focusing on consumer vulnerability, called Vulnerability and/uni00A0Energy Networks, Identification and Consumption Evaluation (VENICE). VENICE is/uni00A0developing ways to predict consumer vulnerability, measuring the impact the pandemic had on the networks and using a community",

Equinox's focus is to make heat flexibility accessible to DNOs and beneficial to customers by running the UK's largest heat flexibility trial.\n\nValues of decarbonisation, excellence and value/uni00A0for money continue to shape WPD's innovation strategy which sets priority areas and/uni00A0commitments. WPD's projects focus on decarbonisation and net zero, heat, transport, data and communities/consumer vulnerability. Stakeholder engagement through webinars, innovation events and innovation themed weeks has enabled us to ensure WPD's innovation strategy reflects stakeholders' needs and priorities. WPD's strategy has also been developed further to include our RIIO-ED2 strategic aims and plans which were created through extensive engagement with customers and stakeholders as part of the RIIO-ED2 Business Plan consultation process.\n\n## Electricity System Operator\n\nThe ESO has used the first year of RIIO-2 to ramp up its innovation activities. The ESO was awarded an initial \u00a323 million NIA funding from Ofgem, now accessible as a flexible amount across the five-year regulatory period (previously an annual allowance in RIIO-1). This has allowed the ESO to increase the size and number of innovation projects in our pipeline, helping to address priority challenges or opportunities across all the ESO roles. For 2021/22, the ESO has spent \u00a34.43 million on innovation projects; the/uni00A0pipeline of approved projects continues to increase significantly as we continue into 2022/23. The Virtual Energy System (VirtualES) will be a cornerstone of ESO innovation going forward; this programme aims to establish an interconnected network of digital twins for individual components of the energy system, eventually creating a digital replica of the whole energy system. This would unlock greater insights and drive better decisions required for GB to achieve net zero targets, more quickly and efficiently. We have started initial projects to develop a common framework for the VirtualES. In parallel, new innovation projects are currently developing the specific tools and use-cases of the VirtualES to highlight the potential and shared benefits from this future industry-led resource.\n\n## UK Gas\n\nIn our first year of RIIO-T2, Gas Transmission innovation has developed its portfolio of energy transition projects to meet the UK's net zero 2050 targets. Alongside this energy transitional innovation, asset innovation has developed a/uni00A0focused team to deploy innovations from\n\nRIIO-T1 and drive 'business as usual' innovation. The key highlights of 2021/22 include the/uni00A0following:\n\n- \u00b7  The portfolio of NIA projects has sanctioned 25/uni00A0projects with several further projects under development for 2022/23.\n- \u00b7  Development of 11 collaborative SIF Discovery project applications, with 10 being successfully funded for March - April 2022.\n- \u00b7  Further development of the Hydrogen in the National Transmission System (HyNTS) programme aligned to future hydrogen investments: HyNTS deblending continued for demonstration later in RIIO-T2 allowing for the separation of hydrogen in a natural gas mix and HyNTS compression exploring the capability of NTS compression systems to both be fuelled and compressed hydrogen methane blends.\n- \u00b7  Successful kick-off of the \u00a312.7 million HyNTS FutureGrid NIC project at DNV's Spadeadam Test and Research Centre. Progress includes decommissioned assets delivered to site and remedial works undertaken, groundworks completed ready for construction and standalone hydrogen testing commencing. The project will demonstrate that the National Transmission System (NTS) can transport hydrogen ready for Project Union (the UK hydrogen backbone).\n- \u00b7  Reduction of methane emissions through the/uni00A0CH4RGE project that looks at reducing methane emissions from rotating gas equipment and has successfully attained first/uni00A0stage funding for demonstration of the systems and capabilities.\n- \u00b7  Deployment of the valve remediation techniques under the Valve Care Toolbox project to provide a suite of solutions that allow for repair rather than replacement of/uni00A0valves.\n\n## US research and development\n\nResearch and development (R&D) work in the US focused on the advancement of products, processes, systems technologies and work methods that may be new to National Grid. This/uni00A0is accomplished by working with internal departments to identify where strategic R&D investment is needed and is likely to prove beneficial. To achieve these goals, we work in collaboration with technical organisations, academia and vendors in the energy sector that align with our goals and objectives to provide a/uni00A0safe, reliable, efficient and clean service. We/uni00A0continue to focus our R&D on increasing public safety, supporting the integration of renewable resource, protecting our workforce and reducing the cost of the work we perform.\n\nResearch efforts are designed with the focus on/uni00A0shared learnings across jurisdictions to help reduce cost and allow for a faster pace of technology adoption.\n\nIn 2021/22, we continued to invest and participate in several significant pilot projects with the intention of obtaining operational knowledge and experience of technology-driven system impacts.\n\n## US Electricity\n\n## New England - Distribution\n\n- \u00b7  In January 2022, we reached a milestone of/uni00A0connecting more than 3 GW of renewable distributed generation across our network enough to power approximately 600,000 homes. National Grid is ranked as the second utility in the nation for non-residential solar installations and seventh for residential solar installations.\n- \u00b7  We are implementing grid modernisation technologies such as Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) to improve resilience. FLISR helps optimise system performance by reducing customer outage duration. The programme reduces the minutes of interruption experienced by customers by automatically rerouting power in a way that the electric system previously was not capable of. As an example, in the midst of the 2021 nor'easter, the FLISR scheme was active on feeders from West Salem and Saugus in the North Shore District in New England. A tree limb created a mainline fault condition between the West Salem substation circuit breaker and the first downstream pole-top recloser on the line. FLISR logic was activated and quickly restored service to 1,531 customers in 16 seconds. The remaining 2,356 customers experiencing the outage had their service restored in 141 minutes after the repairs to the feeder were completed. Had this FLISR scheme not been implemented, all 3,887 customers would have experienced the full outage. Another example occurred in February 2021, when a storm in East Boxford, Massachusetts knocked out power to approximately 1,000 customers. FLISR enabled the restoration of power to 400 of the customers almost immediately and minimised restoration time for the remaining 600. These events demonstrated the self-healing capabilities provided by the Advanced Data Analytics/FLISR investments.\n\n## New England - Transmission\n\n- \u00b7  National Grid successfully deployed the dynamic line ratings technologies on two transmission lines in New England. This technology allows maximum utilisation of the/uni00A0existing transmission line capacity and supports the Company's net zero emissions/uni00A0goal.\n- \u00b7  National Grid successfully deployed the dynamic transformer ratings technologies on two substation transformers. This technology allows maximum utilisation of the existing transformer capacity and supports the Company's net zero emissions goal.\n\n## New York - Transmission\n\n- \u00b7  In New York, we have a joint development agreement with the New York Power Authority (NYPA) for co-investment in the Smart Path Connect transmission project to enable the delivery of approximately 1 GW of large-scale renewable generation. Expected to be in service by the/uni00A0end of 2025, this project will deliver 1,000 MWs of renewable energy across New/uni00A0York.",

In addition, this battery will be providing wholesale market value during Blue-sky days by bidding into the NYISO wholesale electric market, returning any money earned to customers.\n- \u00b7  In New York, we are helping grow participation in community distributed generation through a/uni00A0novel customer billing solution we developed and proposed to our regulators. We also recently received approval for Solar for All, a/uni00A0programme to increase solar access for 175,000 of our income-eligible customers. We/uni00A0have proposed a similar programme called/uni00A0MA Community Shared Solar.\n- \u00b7  In downstate New York, we launched a/uni00A0portfolio of Weatherisation Programmes aimed to reduce natural gas peak demand, save our customers energy and provide them with a more comfortable and resilient home. Every home weatherised is equivalent to carbon sequestered by an entire acre of US forests a year.\n\n## Calibration across multiple jurisdictions\n\n- \u00b7  We are moving from interconnecting to integrating of DERs so we can better utilise/uni00A0them for the system needs. We are/uni00A0implementing Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) that will support distribution control room operations by providing greater visibility, situation awareness, and optimisation of the distribution system and have created digital products for implementing our DERMS solution so we can streamline DER interconnections and reduce costs for customers.\n- \u00b7  One of the big initiatives we're looking to do is/uni00A0implement an AMI installation programme, which is foundational to a lot of other initiatives that rely on that near-real-time customer data.\n- \u00b7  AMI will provide more granular energy usage data to enable customers to better understand and choose between DER offerings (i.e. distributed generation, storage, EV, demand response and energy-efficiency solutions) to better manage their energy usage and costs.\n\n## Hydrogen pilots\n\n- \u00b7  We are researching how hydrogen will perform in our existing gas infrastructure through our membership with a US Department of Energy funded consortium called Hyblend and through work with the New York State Energy Research Development Authority (NYSERDA) and Stony Brook University.\n- \u00b7  We are also partnering with Standard Hydrogen Corporation to develop the nation's first multi-use, renewable hydrogen-based energy storage and delivery system in New York, which is pending regulatory approval. The system will have the ability to power fuel\n\n- cell vehicles, shift energy peaking, provide backup power and blend hydrogen into the gas network - all from one system and site.\n- \u00b7  We have partnered with the town of Hempstead on Long Island, NY to use hydrogen to heat 800 homes and fuel a fleet of municipal vehicles, which will be active by/uni00A02024.\n\n## Electric vehicles\n\n- \u00b7  National Grid has helped our customers to/uni00A0deploy almost 4,411 EV chargers, with 46%/uni00A0located in environmental or disadvantaged communities.\n- \u00b7  We partnered with the city of Beverly on an electric school bus project where the bus delivers stored energy back to the grid to help meet peak energy demand. Not only does this/uni00A0approach reduce local emissions and strengthen the grid, but participants receive a/uni00A0financial incentive. This past summer the Beverly bus discharged nearly 3 MWh of electricity stored in its battery system to the regional electric grid over the course of 30/uni00A0events.\n- \u00b7  Internally, we have light-duty EVs in our fleet. We also are one of the first utilities to introduce an electric backhoe into our fleet and we are testing Ford's first E-Transit vans in/uni00A0downstate New York and Massachusetts.\n\n## Digital strategy\n\nWe are adopting an agile product methodology and digital approach to implement our business strategy for fast delivery of customer outcomes. We are moving ahead with the following projects:\n\n- \u00b7  Active Resource Integration: An integrated platform that will dynamically manage distributed generation power export for short duration constraints to avoid costly electric system upgrades. It will help optimise DER network utilisation through curtailment management, offering flexible interconnection service at an economic cost and timeframe to/uni00A0developers/customers.\n- \u00b7  Vegetation Management Optimisation (VMO): A risk-based vegetation management planning tool using satellite imagery and artificial intelligence to optimise when we prune vegetation and manage hazardous trees on/uni00A0our system. Efficiencies identified are being reinvested to improve reliability and storms costs. We worked with AiDash, a/uni00A0National Grid Partner, and were the first in our industry to implement at a system level.\n- \u00b7  Digital product for totex optimisation of Electric workplans. At its core, FutureNow leverages data-driven value models and an optimisation engine to drive equal or better distribution and transmission workplan outcomes at significantly reduced cost. Every project is evaluated along common value drivers (i.e. reliability, capacity, safety and risk) and the overall workplan is resource-balanced in a/uni00A0semi-automated fashion that will save the business hundreds of hours of manual labor annually. FutureNow also drives organisational efficiencies by integrating workplan information from multiple systems into one\n- unified platform, and is envisioned to unlock additional value by applying predictive analytics to improve electric workplan adherence and on-time/on-budget execution.\n- \u00b7   On My Way: a digital work dispatch and completion tool. An integrated digital solution focused on better supporting field operations, particularly line crews and trouble workers, by/uni00A0putting in place digital work packages and allowing for more efficient job coordination, assignment and execution. The goal is to move from paper-based work dispatch to digitalised work packages and real-time job dispatch/update/close from any location, thereby generating full time equivalent capacity for reallocation and reductions in/uni00A0fuel/uni00A0and paper/uni00A0costs.\n\n## US Gas\n\n## New York\n\n- \u00b7  While partnering with a robotics company and another utility, we have been developing and testing new technology to locate inadvertent sewer cross-bores created when using some trenchless technology. This technology is deployed in our gas main immediately after installation, prior to the introduction of natural gas. It differs from the current process, which requires us to gain access to the municipal sewer system. Deployment will reduce the risk and cost associated with sewer cross-bores. We constructed a functional sewer system covering five hectares at one of our facilities to/uni00A0test the accuracy of the technology. We purposefully created cross-bores in the system at several points to determine if the technology could locate them. The technology found all the cross-bores with no false negatives. After achieving positive results deploying this technology in a controlled test bed at one of our NY facilities, the next step was to test this process in the field. This technology was tested after new pipe installation via trenchless methods as well as in validation runs where sewer cross-bores were identified in the field through the existing process. In all cases, the technology was able to verify the locations of the cross-bores accurately. In 2021, we performed 13 inspections with the acoustic cross-bore detector and covered over 18,000 feet of main, 10,000 feet of which was newly installed main, via horizontal directional drilling. We also started knowledge sharing sessions with a/uni00A0California utility which is using the same technology on services to identify any potential cross-bores. The goal is to further validate the technology statistically in 2022.\n- \u00b7  National Grid is working on the development of an integrated safety solution, known as 'Grid of Things', comprising various Internet of/uni00A0Things (IoT) connected devices aimed at preventing gas-related incidents at customer locations. The concept of the integrated safety solution comprises a smart metering device, smart methane detector and devices with the ability to cut off gas flow to the customer. The solution will monitor various hazardous",

The primary goal of this safety solution is to mitigate hazards that can lead to gas-related safety incidents within a customer location, as/uni00A0well as notify the customers and respond to such events in a quicker manner if they were to occur. Another key focus of this initiative is to determine a solution that will work in gas only territories where AMI solutions are not currently available. We've worked with various end device manufacturers to develop prototype solutions that communicate on long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) communications and have performed a successful pilot demonstration in 2021. Through this pilot, we/uni00A0confirmed that these devices can achieve carrier grade communications while achieving greater than 20-year expected battery lifetimes. The next step is to integrate AMI or cellular communications into these devices and test their performance over different communication networks.\n\n- \u00b7  We have partnered with another NY utility and a company in California on the development of an advanced residential methane detector (RMD) which is focused on early detection of gas leaks. This technology is focused on improving the detection of leaks to maximise response time to real hazards. The RMD is in its third prototype phase of development and has shown to be capable of precise and accurate detection of methane at the parts per million level. Several of these prototypes have been deployed at a test facility that is undergoing various methane dispersion tests to mimic typical household leak scenarios. Dispersion testing results showed that the advanced RMD was able to detect gas faster than traditional sensors across a broader range of leak scenarios.\n- \u00b7  National Grid is actively supporting research into the ability to provide green hydrogen in its gas distribution systems with the intention of decarbonising gas service in order to provide our customers an effective option to meet the goals of NY's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA). We are investing in and/or formally collaborating in several targeted R&D projects with various other organisations. The development of hydrogen energy systems is one of the key components of the Low Carbon Resources Initiative (LCRI), which has Technical Support Committees to guide R&D relevant to hydrogen, including renewable fuels, electrolysis and end use. The Company also supports the development of R&D projects in the Operations Technology Development (OTD), Utilization Technology Development and NYSEARCH programmes that primarily support investigations of pipeline integrity with\n\nincreasing use of hydrogen blending as well as understanding and minimising the impact on end-use equipment. The Company is also a/uni00A0founding member of the Institute for Gas Innovation and Technology (I-GIT) at Stony Brook University that is funded separately and includes R&D into power-to-gas concepts. I-GIT is also leading a two-year NYSERDA project into the impacts of hydrogen blending in NY's gas distribution systems including non-destructive examination of used piping exposed to hydrogen, for which the Company's cost-share was approved in Cases 19-G-0309 and 19-G-0310. I-GIT is/uni00A0also the academic lead for the national $14 million HyBlend Collaborative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). This/uni00A0HyBlend programme is sponsored by the US Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office in the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and 22 industry and academic participants, which will identify and evaluate the technical and safety requirements for introducing hydrogen blending into US gas distribution systems. The HyBlend CRADA is being led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and implemented by six other national laboratories. The project kicked off in August 2021 and will take about two years.\n\nThe Company is pursuing the above R&D efforts to drive innovations that will improve safety, reliability and operational efficiency of our gas business operations.",

        "page_content": "## Other unaudited financial information\n\n## Alternative performance measures/non-IFRS reconciliations\n\nWithin the Annual Report, a number of financial measures are presented. These measures have been categorised as alternative performance measures (APMs), as per the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) conditions for use of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nAn APM is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS. The Group uses a range of these measures to provide a better understanding of its underlying performance. APMs are reconciled to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure where practicable.\n\nThe Group has defined the following financial measures as APMs derived from IFRS: net revenue, the various adjusted operating profit, earnings and earnings per share metrics detailed in the 'adjusted profit measures' section below, net debt, capital investment, funds from operations (FFO), FFO interest cover and retained cash flow (RCF)/adjusted net debt. For each of these we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable IFRS measure. We present 'constant currency' comparative period performance and capital investment by applying the current year average exchange rate to the relevant US dollar amounts in the comparative periods presented, to remove the year-on-year impact of foreign exchange translation.\n\nWe also have a number of APMs derived from regulatory measures which have no basis under IFRS; we call these Regulatory Performance Measures (RPMs). They comprise: Group RoE, operating company RoE, regulated asset base, regulated financial performance, regulatory gearing, Asset Growth, Value Added, including Value Added per share and Value Growth. These measures include the inputs used by utility regulators to set the allowed revenues for many of our businesses.\n\nWe use RPMs to monitor progress against our regulatory agreements and certain aspects of our strategic objectives. Further, targets for certain of these performance measures are included in the Company's Annual Performance Plan (APP) and Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP) and contribute to how we reward our employees. As such, we believe that they provide close correlation to the economic value we generate for our shareholders and are therefore important supplemental measures for our shareholders to understand the performance of the business and to ensure a complete understanding of Group performance.\n\nAs the starting point for our RPMs is not IFRS, and these measures are not governed by IFRS, we are unable to provide meaningful reconciliations to any directly comparable IFRS measures, as differences between IFRS and the regulatory recognition rules applied have built up over many years. Instead, for each of these we present an explanation of how the measure has been determined and why it is important, and an overview as to why it would not be meaningful to provide a reconciliation to IFRS.\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Net revenue\n\nNet revenue is revenue less pass-through costs, such as UK system balancing costs, gas and electricity commodity costs in the US. Pass-through costs are fully recoverable from our customers and are recovered through separate charges that are designed to recover those costs with no profit. Where revenue received or receivable exceeds the maximum amount permitted by our regulatory agreement, adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this over-recovery. No liability is recognised, as such an adjustment to future prices relates to the provision of future services. Similarly, no asset is recognised where a regulatory agreement permits adjustments to be made to future prices in respect of an under-recovery.\n\n|                                | 2022                | 2022                     | 2022            | 2021               | 2021                     | 2021            | 2020              | 2020                     | 2020            |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|\n|                                | Gross  revenue 1 \u00a3m | Pass-  through  costs \u00a3m | Net revenue  \u00a3m | Gross  revenue  \u00a3m | Pass- through  costs  \u00a3m | Net revenue  \u00a3m | Gross revenue  \u00a3m | Pass- through  costs  \u00a3m | Net revenue  \u00a3m |\n| UK Electricity Transmission    | 2,035               | (152)                    | 1,883           | 1,974              | (151)                    | 1,823           | 1,986             | (177)                    | 1,809           |\n| UK Electricity Distribution    | 1,482               | (125)                    | 1,357           | -                  | -                        | -               | -                 | -                        | -               |\n| UK Electricity System Operator | 3,455               | (3,215)                  | 240             | 2,018              | (1,911)                  | 107             | 1,716             | (1,351)                  | 365             |\n| New England                    | 4,550               | (2,050)                  | 2,500           | 4,214              | (1,784)                  | 2,430           | 4,235             | (1,997)                  | 2,238           |\n| New York                       | 5,561               | (2,161)                  | 3,400           | 4,605              | (1,469)                  | 3,136           | 4,601             | (1,463)                  | 3,138           |\n| NGV and Other                  | 1,216               | -                        | 1,216           | 864                | -                        | 864             | 834               | -                        | 834             |\n| Sales between segments         | (39)                | -                        | (39)            | (10)               | -                        | (10)            | (12)              | -                        | (12)            |\n| Total - continuing operations  | 18,260              | (7,703)                  | 10,557          | 13,665             | (5,315)                  | 8,350           | 13,360            | (4,988)                  | 8,372           |\n| Discontinued operations        | 1,362               | (397)                    | 965             | 1,114              | (233)                    | 881             | 1,180             | (242)                    | 938             |\n| Total                          | 19,622              | (8,100)                  | 11,522          | 14,779             | (5,548)                  | 9,231           | 14,540            | (5,230)                  | 9,310           |\n\n## Adjusted profit measures\n\nIn considering the financial performance of our business and segments, we use various adjusted profit measures in order to aid comparability of results year-on-year. The various measures are presented on pages 37 - 49 and reconciled below.\n\nAdjusted results - these exclude the impact of exceptional items and remeasurements that are treated as discrete transactions under IFRS and can accordingly be classified as such. This is a measure used by management that is used to derive part of the incentive target set annually for remunerating certain Executive Directors, and further details of these items are included in note 5 to the financial statements.\n\nUnderlying results - further adapts our adjusted results for continuing operations to take account of volumetric and other revenue timing differences arising due to the in-year difference between allowed and collected revenues, including revenue incentives, as governed by our rate plans in the US or regulatory price controls in the UK (but excluding totex-related allowances and adjustments or allowances for pension deficit contributions). For 2021/22, as highlighted on page 269, our underlying results exclude \u00a316 million (2020/21: \u00a3111 million) of timing differences as well as \u00a3163 million (2020/21: \u00a3150 million) of major storm costs (as costs exceeded our $100 million threshold in both 2021/22 and 2020/21). We expect to recover major storm costs incurred through regulatory mechanisms in the US.\n\nConstant currency - the adjusted profit measures are also shown on a constant currency basis to show the year-on-year comparisons excluding any impact of foreign currency translation movements.",

We calculate the tariffs we charge our customers based on the estimated volume of energy we expect will be delivered during the coming period. The actual volumes delivered will differ from the estimate. Therefore, our total actual revenue will be different from our total allowed revenue. These differences are commonly referred to as timing differences. If we collect more than the allowed revenue, adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this over-recovery, and if we collect less than the allowed level of revenue, adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect the under-recovery. In the US, a substantial portion of our costs are pass-through costs (including commodity and energy-efficiency costs) and are fully recoverable from our customers. Timing differences between costs of this type being incurred and their recovery through revenue are also included in timing. The amounts calculated as timing differences are estimates and subject to change until the variables that determine allowed revenue are final.\n\nOur continuing operating profit for the year includes a total estimated in-year under-collection of \u00a316 million (2020/21: \u00a3111 million under-collection). For continuing operations, our closing balance at 31 March 2022 was \u00a353 million over-recovered. Excluding discontinued operations, there was a cumulative under-recovery of \u00a3190 million at 31 March 2022 (2021: under-recovery of \u00a370 million) in the UK. In the US, cumulative timing over-recoveries at 31 March 2022 were \u00a3293 million (2021: \u00a3198 million over-recovery). The total estimated in-year over- or under-collection excludes opening balance adjustments related to estimates or finalisation of balances as part of regulatory submissions.\n\nIn addition to the timing adjustments described above, as part of the RIIO price controls in the UK, outperformance against allowances as a result of the totex incentive mechanism, together with changes in output-related allowances included in the original price control, will almost always be adjusted in future revenue recoveries, typically starting in two years' time. We also receive revenues in relation to certain costs incurred or expected to be incurred (for example pension deficit contributions), with differences between revenues received and cost incurred adjusted in future revenue recoveries, e.g. after a triennial actuarial pension funding valuation has been concluded. Our current IFRS revenues and earnings include these amounts that relate to certain costs incurred in prior years or that will need to be repaid or recovered in future periods. Such adjustments will form an important part of the continuing difference between reported IFRS results and underlying economic performance based on our regulatory obligations.\n\nFor our UK regulated businesses as a whole (including discontinued operations), timing and regulated revenue adjustments totalled a return of \u00a3190 million in the year (2020/21: \u00a3184 million return). In the US, accumulated regulatory entitlements cover a range of different areas, with the most significant being environmental remediation and pension assets, as well as deferred storm costs. All regulatory entitlements are recoverable (or repayable) over different periods, which are agreed with the regulators to match the expected payment profile for the liabilities.\n\n|                                                        | UK Electricity Transmission  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity Distribution  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity System Operator  \u00a3m   | New England  \u00a3m   | New York  \u00a3m   | Continuing  \u00a3m   | Discontinued  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| 1 April 2021 opening balance\u00b9                          | -                                 | -                                 | (80)                                 | (266)             | 465            | 119              | (76)               | 43          |\n| Over/(under)-recovery                                  | (85)                              | 22                                | (47)                                 | (32)              | 126            | (16)             | (80)               | (96)        |\n| 31 March 2022 closing balance  to (recover)/return\u00b2    | (85)                              | 22                                | (127)                                | (298)             | 591            | 103              | (156)              | (53)        |\n|                                                        | UK Electricity Transmission  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity Distribution  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity  System Operator  \u00a3m  | New England \u00a3m    | New York  \u00a3m   | Continuing  \u00a3m   | Discontinued  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n| 1 April 2020 opening balance\u00b9                          | (52)                              | -                                 | 70                                   | (254)             | 479            | 243              | 16                 | 259         |\n| Over/(under)-recovery                                  | 42                                | -                                 | (130)                                | (11)              | (12)           | (111)            | (96)               | (207)       |\n| 31 March 2021 closing balance  to (recover)/return 2,3 | (10)                              | -                                 | (60)                                 | (265)             | 467            | 132              | (80)               | 52          |\n|                                                        | UK Electricity Transmission  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity Distribution  \u00a3m   | UK Electricity  System Operator  \u00a3m  | New England  \u00a3m   | New York  \u00a3m   | Continuing  \u00a3m   | Discontinued  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n| 1 April 2019 opening balance\u00b9                          | (141)                             | -                                 | 14                                   | (108)             | 558            | 323              | 59                 | 382         |\n| Over/(under)-recovery                                  | 85                                | -                                 | 61                                   | (149)             | (79)           | (82)             | (54)               | (136)       |\n| 31 March 2020 closing balance  to (recover)/return 2,3 | (56)                              | -                                 | 75                                   | (257)             | 479            | 241              | 5                  | 246         |",

This measure provides a bridge for investors between a well-understood and comparable IFRS starting point and through the key adjustments required to approximate regulatory profit. This measure also provides the foundation to calculate Group RoE.\n\nFor the reasons noted above, the table below shows the principal differences between the IFRS operating profit and the regulated financial performance, but is not a formal reconciliation to an equivalent IFRS measure.\n\n## UK Electricity Transmission\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                               | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Adjusted operating profit                                         | 1,067     | 1,094     | 1,109     |\n| Movement in regulatory 'IOUs'                                     | 82        | 59        | 21        |\n| Deferred taxation adjustment                                      | 26        | 53        | 60        |\n| RAV indexation - 2% CPIH (2020 & 2021: 3% RPI) long-run inflation | 287       | 418       | 401       |\n| Regulatory vs IFRS depreciation difference                        | (433)     | (434)     | (448)     |\n| Fast money/other                                                  | (44)      | 57        | 70        |\n| Pensions                                                          | (42)      | (41)      | (40)      |\n| Performance RAV created                                           | 75        | 110       | 122       |\n| Regulated financial performance                                   | 1,018     | 1,316     | 1,295     |",

Where revenue received or receivable exceeds the maximum amount permitted by our regulatory agreement, adjustments will be made to future prices to reflect this over-recovery. No liability is recognised under IFRS, as such an adjustment to future prices relates to the provision of future services. Similarly, no asset is recognised under IFRS where a regulatory agreement permits adjustments to be made to future prices in respect of an under-recovery. In the UK, this is calculated as the movement in other regulated assets and liabilities.\n\nPerformance RAV UK performance efficiencies are in part remunerated by the creation of additional RAV which is expected to result in future earnings under regulatory arrangements. This is calculated as in-year totex outperformance multiplied by the appropriate regulatory capitalisation ratio and multiplied by the retained company incentive sharing ratio.\n\nPension adjustment Cash payments against pension deficits in the UK are recoverable under regulatory contracts. In US Regulated operations, US GAAP pension charges are generally recoverable through rates. Revenue recoveries are recognised under IFRS but payments are not charged against IFRS operating profits in the year. In the UK, this is calculated as cash payments against the regulatory proportion of pension deficits in the UK regulated business, whereas in the US, it is the difference between IFRS and US GAAP pension charges.\n\n2% CPIH and 3% RPI RAV indexation Future UK revenues are expected to be set using an asset base adjusted for inflation. This is calculated as UK RAV multiplied by 2% long-run CPIH inflation assumption under RIIO-2 and a 3% long-run RPI inflation assumption under RIIO-1.\n\nUK deferred taxation adjustment Future UK revenues are expected to recover cash taxation cost including the unwinding of deferred taxation balances created in the current year. This is the difference between: (a) IFRS underlying EBITDA less other regulatory adjustments; and (b) IFRS underlying EBITDA less other regulatory adjustments less current taxation (adjusted for interest tax shield) then grossed up at full UK statutory tax rate.\n\nRegulatory depreciation US and UK regulated revenues include allowance for a return of regulatory capital in accordance with regulatory assumed asset lives. This return does not form part of regulatory profit.\n\nFast/slow money adjustment The regulatory remuneration of costs incurred is split between in-year revenue allowances and the creation of additional RAV. This does not align with the classification of costs as operating costs and fixed asset additions under IFRS accounting principles. This is calculated as the difference between IFRS classification of costs as operating costs or fixed asset additions and the regulatory classification.\n\n## Regulated asset base\n\nThe regulated asset base is a regulatory construct, based on predetermined principles not based on IFRS. It effectively represents the invested capital on which we are authorised to earn a cash return. By investing efficiently in our networks, we add to our regulated asset base over the long term, and this in turn contributes to delivering shareholder value. Our regulated asset base comprises of our regulatory asset value in the UK, plus our rate base in the US.\n\nMaintaining efficient investment in our regulated asset base ensures we are well positioned to provide consistently high levels of service to our customers and increases our revenue allowances in future years. While we have no specific target, our overall aim is to achieve between 6% and 8% growth in regulated asset base each year through continued investment in our networks in both the UK and US.\n\nIn the UK, the way in which our transactions impact RAV is driven by principles set out by Ofgem. In a number of key areas these principles differ from the requirements of IFRS, including areas such as additions and the basis for depreciation. Further, our UK RAV is adjusted annually for inflation. RAV in each of our retained UK businesses has evolved over the period since privatisation in 1990, and as a result, historical differences between the initial determination of RAV and balances reported under UK GAAP at that time still persist. In the case of WPD, differences arise as the result of acquisition fair value adjustments (where PP&E at acquisition has been valued above RAV). Due to the above, substantial differences exist in the measurement bases between RAV and an IFRS balance metric, and therefore, it is not possible to provide a meaningful reconciliation between the two.\n\nIn the US, rate base is a regulatory measure determined for each of our main US operating companies. It represents the value of property and other assets or liabilities on which we are permitted to earn a rate of return, as set out by the regulatory authorities for each jurisdiction. The calculations are based on the applicable regulatory agreements for each jurisdiction and include the allowable elements of assets and liabilities from our US companies. For this reason, it is not practical to provide a meaningful reconciliation from the US rate base to an equivalent IFRS measure. However, we include the calculation below.\n\n'Total regulated and other balances' for our UK regulated businesses include the under or over-recovery of allowances that those businesses target to collect in any year, which are based on the regulator's forecasts for that year. Under the UK price control arrangements, revenues will be adjusted in future years to take account of actual levels of collected revenue, costs and outputs delivered when they differ from those regulatory forecasts. In the US, other regulatory assets and liabilities include regulatory assets and liabilities which are not included in the definition of rate base, including working capital where appropriate.\n\n'Total regulated and other balances' for NGV and Other businesses includes assets and liabilities as measured under IFRS, but excludes certain assets and liabilities such as pensions, tax, net debt and goodwill. This also includes a \u00a3101 million deferred balance for separation and transaction costs already incurred related to the sale of NECO and UK Gas Transmission, which is expected to be offset against the proceeds received on disposal of these businesses in 2022/23.",

It therefore reflects the regulated activities as well as the contribution from our non-regulated businesses together with joint ventures and non-controlling interests.\n\nWe use Group RoE to measure our performance in generating value for our shareholders, and targets for Group RoE are included in the incentive mechanisms for executive remuneration within both the APP and LTPP schemes.\n\nGroup RoE is underpinned by our regulated asset base. For the reasons noted above, no reconciliation to IFRS has been presented, as we do not believe it would be practical. However, we do include the calculations below.\n\nCalculation: Regulatory financial performance including a long-run inflation assumption (3% RPI for RIIO-1; 2% CPIH for RIIO-2), less adjusted interest and adjusted taxation divided by equity investment in assets:\n\n- \u00b7 adjusted interest removes interest on pensions, capitalised interest in regulated operations and unwind of discount rate on provisions;\n- \u00b7 adjusted taxation adjusts the Group taxation charge for differences between IFRS profit before tax and regulated financial performance less adjusted interest; and\n- \u00b7 equity investment in assets is calculated as the total opening UK regulatory asset value, the total opening US rate base plus goodwill plus opening net book value of National Grid Ventures and Other activities (excluding certain amounts such as pensions, tax and commodities) and our share of joint ventures and associates, minus opening net debt as reported under IFRS restated to the weighted average \u00a3/$ exchange rate for the year.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                            | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Regulated financial performance                                | 3,684     | 3,381     | 3,507     |\n| Operating profit of other activities - continuing operations   | 330       | 144       | 153       |\n| Operating profit of other activities - discontinued operations | 150       | 157       | 155       |\n| Group financial performance                                    | 4,164     | 3,682     | 3,815     |\n| Share of post-tax results of joint ventures and associates     | 148       | 66        | 88        |\n| Non-controlling interests                                      | (1)       | (1)       | (1)       |\n| Adjusted total Group interest charge (including discontinued)  | (1,191)   | (882)     | (1,069)   |\n| Total Group tax charge (including discontinued)                | (761)     | (416)     | (433)     |\n| Tax on adjustments                                             | 43        | (175)     | (117)     |\n| Total Group financial performance after interest and tax       | 2,402     | 2,274     | 2,283     |\n| Opening rate base/RAV                                          | 41,043    | 39,552    | 37,459    |\n| Opening other balances                                         | 4,864     | 3,984     | 3,304     |\n| Opening goodwill                                               | 5,266     | 5,295     | 5,435     |\n| Opening capital employed                                       | 51,173    | 48,831    | 46,198    |\n| Opening net debt                                               | (30,072)  | (27,398)  | (27,194)  |\n| Opening equity                                                 | 21,101    | 21,433    | 19,004    |\n| Return on Equity 1                                             | 11.4 %    | 10.6 %    | 12.0 %    |",

These returns are calculated using the assumption that the businesses are financed in line with the regulatory adjudicated capital structure, at the cost of debt assumed by the regulator, and that inflation is equal to a long-run assumption of 3% RPI under RIIO-1 and 2% CPIH under RIIO-2. They are calculated by dividing elements of out/under-performance versus the regulatory contract (i.e. regulated financial performance disclosed above) by the average equity RAV in line with the regulatory assumed capital structure and adding to the base allowed RoE.\n\nThese are important measures of UK regulated businesses' performance, and our operational strategy continues to focus on these metrics. These measures can be used to determine how we are performing under the RIIO framework and also helps investors to compare our performance with similarly regulated UK entities. Reflecting the importance of these metrics, they are also key components of the APP scheme.\n\nThe respective businesses' UK RoEs are underpinned by their RAVs. For the reasons noted above, no reconciliation to IFRS has been presented, as we do not believe it would be practical.\n\n## US businesses' regulated RoEs\n\nUS regulated businesses' RoEs are a measure of how the businesses are performing against the assumptions used by the US regulators. This US operational return measure is calculated using the assumption that the businesses are financed in line with the regulatory adjudicated capital structure and allowed cost of debt. The returns are divided by the average rate base (or where a reported rate base is not available, an estimate based on rate base calculations used in previous rate filings) multiplied by the adjudicated equity portion in the regulatory adjudicated capital structure.\n\nThese are important measures of our New England and New York regulated businesses' performance, and our operational strategy continues to focus on these metrics. This measure can be used to determine how we are performing and also helps investors compare our performance with similarly regulated US entities. Reflecting the importance of these metrics, they are also key components of the APP scheme.\n\nThe New England and New York businesses' returns are based on a calculation which gives proportionately more weighting to those businesses which have a greater rate base. For the reasons noted above, no reconciliations to IFRS for the RoE measures have been presented, as we do not believe it would be practical to reconcile our IFRS balance sheet to the equity base.\n\nThe table below shows the principal differences between the IFRS result of the New England and New York segments, and the 'returns' used to derive their respective US jurisdictional RoEs. In outlining these differences, we also include the aggregated business results under US GAAP for New England and New York jurisdictions.\n\nIn respect of 2020/21 and 2019/20, this measure is the aggregate operating profit of our US OpCo entities' publicly available financial statements prepared under US GAAP for the New England and New York jurisdictions respectively. For 2021/22, this measure represents our current estimate, since local financial statements have yet to be prepared.\n\n|                                                          | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Underlying IFRS operating profit for New England segment | 886       | 727       | 680       |\n| Underlying IFRS operating profit for New York segment    | 706       | 722       | 917       |\n| Weighted average \u00a3/$ exchange rate                       | $1.348    | $1.341    | $1.287    |",

It is a key metric used to measure our performance and underpins our approach to sustainable decision making and long-term management incentive arrangements.\n\nValue Added is derived using our regulated asset base and, as such, it is not practical to provide a meaningful reconciliation from this measure to an equivalent IFRS measure due to the reasons set out for our regulated asset base. However, the calculation is set out in the Financial review. Value Added per share is calculated by dividing Value Added by the weighted average number of shares (3,599 million) set out in note 8.\n\nValue Growth of 12.8% (2021: 9.4%) is derived from Value Added by adjusting Value Added to normalise for our estimate of the long-run inflation rate (3% RPI for RIIO-1 and our RPI-linked net debt; 2% CPIH for RIIO-2). In 2021, the numerator for Value Growth was \u00a32,730 million (2021: \u00a31,995 million). The denominator is Group equity as used in the Group RoE calculation, adjusted for foreign exchange movements.\n\n## Asset growth\n\nAsset growth is the annual percentage increase in our RAV and rate base and other business balances (including the assets of NGV and NGP) calculated at constant currency.\n\n## Regulatory gearing\n\nRegulatory gearing is a measure of how much of our investment in RAV and rate base and other elements of our invested capital (including our investments in NGV, UK property and other assets and US other assets) is funded through debt. Comparative amounts as at 31 March 2021 are presented at historical exchange rates and have not been restated for opening balance adjustments.\n\n| As at 31 March                                                                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| UK RAV                                                                             | 31,593    | 20,872    |         |\n| US rate base                                                                       | 22,178    | 20,041    |         |\n| Other invested capital included in gearing calculation                             | 5,226     | 4,458     |         |\n| Total assets included in gearing calculation                                       | 58,997    | 45,371    |         |\n| Net debt (including 100% of hybrid debt and held for sale)                         | (48,043)  | (29,665)  | change  |\n| Group gearing (based on 100% of net debt including held for sale)                  | 81 %      | 65 %      | 16% pts |\n| Group gearing (excluding 50% of hybrid debt from net debt) including held for sale | 80 %      | 63 %      | 17% pts |",

        "page_content": "## Commentary on consolidated financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2021\n\nIn compliance with SEC rules, we present a summarised analysis of movements in the income statement and an analysis of movements in adjusted operating profit (for the continuing Group) by operating segment. This should be read in conjunction with the 31 March 2022 Financial review included on pages 36 - 49.\n\n## Analysis of the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2021\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue from continuing operations for the year ended 31 March 2021 increased by \u00a3305 million to \u00a313,665 million. Revenues were driven by a \u00a3302 million increase in UK Electricity System Operator (mainly as a result of higher balancing service pass-through costs, offset by year-on-year timing under-recoveries). Rate increases in both New England and New York were more than offset by lower revenues for commodity pass-through costs. Revenue from NGV and Other increased by \u00a334 million, related to our US renewables business and Partners gains, partly offset by lower Property sales.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nOperating costs from continuing activities for the year ended 31 March 2021 of \u00a310,939 million were \u00a392 million higher than prior year. This increase in costs was offset by a \u00a3499 million reduction in exceptional items and remeasurements income compared to 2019/20, principally related to the US environmental provision booked in 2019/20 and yearon -year movements in commodity contract remeasurements. In addition, higher operating costs were driven by higher UK BSIS pass-through costs, higher workforce costs and higher depreciation as a result of continued asset investment. This was partially offset by the impact of lower costs in respect of purchases of gas and electricity and the impact of movement in foreign exchange.\n\nIn addition to the operating costs of \u00a310,939 million above, provisions for bad and doubtful debts of \u00a3325 million were recorded, \u00a391 million higher than the year ended 31 March 2020, principally as a result of the continued impact of COVID-19 on the Group's operations.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, net finance costs from continuing operations before exceptional items and remeasurements were \u00a364 million lower than the year ended 31 March 2020 at \u00a3865 million driven by the impact of lower inflation on our RPI-linked debt, new debt issued at lower rates, a higher net debt as a result of asset growth, termination fees incurred in the prior year and favourable foreign exchange movements, partly offset by higher interest on pension and OPEB liabilities and a higher benefit from interest on tax settlements in 2019/20.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe tax charge on profits before exceptional items and remeasurements of \u00a3334 million was \u00a328 million lower than the year ended 31 March 2020. This was mainly related to a lower level of profit before tax in the year ended 31 March 2021 compared to the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n## Exceptional items and remeasurements\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2021, exceptional items included a \u00a350 million charge in relation to our new operating model implementation costs alongside a \u00a324 million charge in relation to transaction and separation costs (principally in relation to the acquisition of WPD). A \u00a314 million credit was also recognised relating to the release of environmental provisions for one of our Superfund sites for the which the original provision was treated as an exceptional item.\n\nIn the prior year, exceptional items included a \u00a3400 million charge associated with changes in our environmental provisions and an additional deferred tax charge of \u00a3148 million reflecting the impact of the remeasurement of the Group's deferred tax liabilities as a result of a change in the substantively enacted UK corporation tax rate.\n\nRemeasurement gains of \u00a334 million were recognised on commodity contracts in the year ended 31 March 2021 compared with losses of \u00a3125 million in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nFinance costs for the year ended 31 March 2021 included a net gain of \u00a370 million on financial remeasurements of derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, compared to a net loss of \u00a337 million on financial remeasurements in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nShare of post-tax results of joint ventures and associates before exceptional items for the year ended 31 March 2021 were \u00a366 million compared to \u00a388 million in the year ended 31 March 2020, principally due to reduced profits in St William, our Property joint venture.\n\n## Profit after tax from discontinued operations\n\nProfit after tax from discontinued operations increased by \u00a3102 million to \u00a3337 million. This included exceptional costs and remeasurements of \u00a33 million in 2020/21 compared to \u00a382 million in 2019/20. Excluding exceptional items and remeasurements, adjusted operating profit was broadly flat compared to the year ended 31 March 2020. There was an overall reduction of \u00a337 million in the net financing costs attributable to discontinued operations mostly driven by the impact of RPI on our inflation-linked debt. Tax for discontinued operations was \u00a382 million in the year ended 31 March 2021, a \u00a310 million higher tax charge than the prior year driven by higher levels of profit.\n\n## Adjusted earnings and EPS from continuing operations\n\nAdjusted earnings and EPS, which exclude exceptional items and remeasurements, are provided to reflect the Group's results on an 'adjusted profit' basis, described further in note 5. See page 270 for a reconciliation of adjusted basic EPS to EPS.\n\nThe above earnings performance translated into adjusted EPS in the year ended 31 March 2021 of 36.7p, compared to 46.2p in the year ended 31 March 2020. Including discontinued operations, adjusted EPS in the year ended 31 March 2021 of 46.4p, compared to 55.4p in the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nOur financial results are reported in sterling. Transactions for our US operations are denominated in dollars, so the related amounts that are reported in sterling depend on the dollar to sterling exchange rate. The table below shows the average and closing exchange rates of sterling to US dollars.\n\n|                                             |   2020/21 |   2019/20 | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Weighted average (income statement)         |      1.34 |      1.29 | 4 %        |\n| Year end (statement  of financial position) |      1.38 |      1.24 | 11 %       |\n\nThe movement in foreign exchange during the year ended 31 March 2021 has resulted in a \u00a3374 million decrease in revenue, a \u00a355 million decrease in adjusted operating profit and a \u00a365 million decrease in underlying operating profit.",

        "page_content": "## Analysis of the adjusted operating profit by segment for the year ended 31 March 2021\n\n## UK Electricity Transmission\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, revenue in the UK Electricity Transmission segment decreased by \u00a312 million to \u00a31,974 million, and adjusted operating profit increased by \u00a315 million to \u00a31,094 million. Revenue was lower principally as the result of lower pass-through costs and lower incentives. Excluding pass-through costs, net revenue was \u00a314 million higher, as a result of income from legal settlements, the result of RAV indexation from inflation, offset by adverse MOD adjustments, lower base revenues and lower timing over-recoveries (incentives and lower collection of prior period under-recoveries). Regulated controllable costs were \u00a316 million lower, reflecting inflation and higher IT costs, but these were more than offset by efficiency savings. Depreciation and amortisation was \u00a329 million higher due to prior year impairment, a full year of Western Link and provision releases in the year ended 31 March 2021. Other costs were \u00a321 million higher, principally the result of credits related to diversions arising in the prior year.\n\nCapital expenditure increased by \u00a333 million compared with the year ended 31 March 2020 to \u00a3984 million reflecting increased activity on Hinkley Seabank, London Power Tunnels 2 and higher capex on the Dorset Visual Impact Provision project in the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## UK Electricity System Operator\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, revenue in the UK Electricity System Operator segment increased by \u00a3302 million to \u00a32,018 million but this was principally as the result of higher pass-through costs, which increased from \u00a31,351 million in 2019/20 to \u00a31,911 million in 2020/21 (principally reflecting higher balancing service costs due to reduced demand as a result of COVID-19 and higher intervention costs required to balance the grid). Excluding pass-through costs, net revenue was \u00a3271 million lower, as the result of \u00a3130 million timing under-recoveries in 2020/21 compared to \u00a360 million over-recoveries in 2019/20 (mainly lower volumes and the impact of the BSUoS deferral scheme). Regulated controllable costs were broadly flat, with inflation and higher IT costs being offset by efficiency savings. Depreciation and amortisation was \u00a39 million higher due to higher asset commissioning.\n\nCapital expenditure decreased by \u00a34 million compared with the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\n## New England\n\nRevenue in the New England segment decreased by \u00a321 million to \u00a34,214 million and adjusted operating profit increased by \u00a388 million to \u00a3611 million.\n\nThe weaker US dollar decreased revenue and operating profit in the year ended 31 March 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, revenue increased by \u00a3137 million. Of this increase, \u00a3134 million was due to decrease in commodity pass-through costs charged on to customers, and \u00a3139 million was due to year-on-year timing movements as a result of under-collection of revenues compared to our regulatory allowances in the year ended 31 March 2020. Excluding pass-through costs and timing swings, net revenue increased by \u00a3410 million at constant currency, principally reflecting increased revenue allowances under rate plans. Regulated controllable costs increased by \u00a376 million (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) as a result of increased IT costs and inflation partly offset by efficiency savings.\n\nCapital expenditure increased by \u00a3127 million (excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements) to \u00a31,437 million, mainly related to increased investment in wholesale networks (including line and cable relocation in NECO, higher LNG spend and also asset refurbishment in New England Power.\n\n## New York\n\nRevenue in our New York segment increased by \u00a34 million to \u00a34,605 million, but adjusted operating profit decreased by \u00a3170 million to \u00a3665 million.\n\nThe weaker US dollar decreased revenue and operating profit in the year ended 31 March 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements, revenue increased by \u00a3176 million. Of this increase, \u00a364 million was due to increases in commodity pass-through costs charged on to customers, and \u00a367 million was due to year-on-year timing movements as a result of under-collection of revenues compared to our regulatory allowances in the year ended 31 March 2020. Excluding passthrough costs and timing swings, net revenue increased by \u00a3179 million at constant currency, principally reflecting increased revenue allowances under rate plans.\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, regulated controllable costs increased by \u00a324 million as a result of increased IT costs and inflation offset by cost efficiencies. Bad debt expense increased by \u00a3132 million at constant currency, driven by additional provisions for receivables related to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation increased by \u00a334 million year-on-year (excluding foreign exchange adjustments) to \u00a3453 million due to ongoing investment in our networks.\n\nCapital expenditure decreased by \u00a316 million (excluding the impact of foreign exchange) to \u00a31,738 million, mainly the consequence of reduced investment in downstate New York (gas pipeline and mandated gas works) which were impacted by disruptions due to COVID-19, mostly offset by damage repair (driven by storm activity in Niagara Mohawk) and accelerated spend in REV (New York's 'Reforming the Energy Vision' programme) and Grid Modernisation, higher IT spend and lease additions.\n\n## NGV and Other\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, revenue in the NGV and Other segment increased by \u00a330 million to \u00a3864 million and adjusted operating profit decreased by \u00a39 million to \u00a3117 million. This reflected higher revenues in our US renewables business, partly offset by lower site sales in our commercial property business and reduced income from support services supplied to Cadent compared to the prior year.\n\nCapital investment was significantly lower at \u00a3480 million in 2020/21, representing a decrease of \u00a382 million year-on-year. This was principally due to the \u00a3209 million acquisition of Geronimo in 2019/20, lower investment in IFA2 which became operational in 2020/21, reduced cable converter spend on North Sea Link, but increased investment in Viking Link and higher investments in NG Partners.\n\n## Discontinued operations - UK Gas Transmission (and metering)\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2021, revenue in the UK Gas Transmission segment decreased by \u00a366 million to \u00a31,114 million and adjusted operating profit decreased by \u00a34 million to \u00a3499 million. Revenue was impacted by lower pass-through costs, adverse year-on-year timing under-recoveries. Net revenue (adjusted for timing) was higher, reflecting the impact of prior year return of Fleetwood allowances and the RPI uplift, partly offset by re -opener allowances in 2019/20 for cyber and data centres and reduced meter population (as these are replaced by smart meters). Regulated controllable costs were \u00a35 million lower principally driven by efficiency savings. Depreciation and amortisation was lower mainly due to reduction in meter population.\n\nCapital expenditure reduced by \u00a384 million to \u00a3204 million, mainly related to the completion of the Feeder 9 gas pipeline replacement project and Peterborough and Huntingdon compressor stations.",

The Directors' Report, comprising pages 1 - 131 and 242 - 288 has been drawn up in accordance with the requirements of English law, and liability in respect thereof is also governed by English law. In particular, the liability of the Directors for these reports is solely to National Grid.\n\nThis document contains certain statements that are neither reported financial results nor other historical information. These statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as/uni00A0amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements include information with respect to our financial condition, our results of operations and businesses, strategy, plans and objectives. Words such as 'aims', 'anticipates', 'expects', 'should', 'intends', 'plans', 'believes', 'outlook', 'seeks', 'estimates', 'targets', 'may', 'will', 'continue', 'project' and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense, identify forward-looking statements. This document also references climate-related targets and climaterelated risks which differ from conventional financial risks in that they are complex, novel and/uni00A0tend to involve projection over long-term scenarios which are subject to significant uncertainty and change.\n\nThese forward-looking statements and targets are not guarantees of our future performance and are subject to assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements and targets. Many of these assumptions, risks and uncertainties relate to factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate\n\nprecisely, such as changes in laws or regulations, including any arising as a result of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; announcements from and decisions by governmental bodies or regulators, including those relating to the RIIO-T2 and RIIO-ED2 price controls and proposals for the future of system operation in the United Kingdom; the timing of construction and delivery by third parties of new generation projects requiring connection; breaches of, or changes in, environmental, climate change, and health and safety laws or regulations, including breaches or other incidents arising from the potentially harmful nature of our activities; network failure or interruption, the inability to carry out critical non-network operations, and damage to infrastructure, due to adverse weather conditions, including the impact of major storms as well as the results of climate change, due to counterparties being unable to deliver physical commodities, or due to the failure of or unauthorised access to or deliberate breaches of our IT systems and supporting technology; failure to adequately forecast and respond to disruptions in energy supply; performance against regulatory targets and standards and against our peers with the aim of/uni00A0delivering stakeholder expectations regarding costs and efficiency savings, as well as against targets and standards designed to deliver net zero; and customers and counterparties (including financial institutions) failing to perform their obligations to the Company. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in this document include fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price indices; restrictions and conditions (including filing requirements) in our borrowing and debt arrangements, funding costs and access to financing; regulatory requirements for us to maintain financial resources in certain parts of our business and restrictions on some subsidiaries' transactions, such as paying dividends, lending or levying charges; the delayed timing of recoveries and payments in our regulated businesses and whether aspects\n\nof our activities are contestable; the funding requirements and performance of our pension schemes and other post-retirement benefit schemes; the failure to attract, develop and retain employees with the necessary competencies, including leadership and business capabilities, and any significant disputes arising with our employees or breaches of laws or regulations by our employees; the failure to respond to market developments, including competition for onshore transmission; the threats and opportunities presented by emerging technology; the failure by the Company to respond to, or meet its own commitments as a leader in relation to, climate change development activities relating to energy transition, including the integration of distributed energy resources; and the need to grow our business to deliver our strategy, as well as incorrect or unforeseen assumptions or conclusions (including unanticipated costs and liabilities) relating to business development activity, including the integration of WPD, the sale of the Company's Rhode Island gas and electricity business and the sale of a/uni00A060% stake in the Group's UK Gas Transmission business, and joint ventures.\n\nFor further details regarding these and other assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may affect National Grid, please read the Strategic Report and the risk factors on pages 253 - 256 of this document. In addition, new factors emerge from time to time and we cannot assess the potential impact of any such factor on our activities or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual future results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Except as may be required by law or regulation, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any of its forward-looking statements, which speak only as/uni00A0of the date of this document.\n\nThe contents of any website references in this document do not form part of this document.",
