Thanks to mass vaccinations, pent-up consumer demand, accommodative monetary policy and strong fiscal support, global growth rebounded sharply. In Singapore, our home market, the economy grew 7.6%. Hong Kong, our second-largest market, expanded 6.4%.\n\nThe robust economic recovery belied a pandemic that continued to rage on for most of the year, which resulted in economic and border re-openings happening in fits and starts.\n\nAgainst this mixed backdrop, we turned in our best year ever, with not just excellent financial performance but also all-round delivery against key scorecard goals.\n\nIn particular, we made good progress in transforming the bank through managing by customer journeys; kept employee morale high\n\n|\n\n'The robust economic recovery belied a pandemic that continued to rage on for most of the year, which resulted in economic and border re-openings happening in fits and starts. Against this mixed backdrop, we turned in our best year ever, with not just excellent financial performance but also all-round delivery against key scorecard goals.'\n\n'We believe the inorganic transactions and investments we made over the last 12 months will strengthen our franchise and position us well to ride the crest of a structurally rising Asia. We expect payoff from these initiatives will materialise in the short to medium-term. Looking further out, given that technological changes could fundamentally reshape the financial system, we must do what we can to be ahead of the curve.'\n\nthrough the pandemic, and launched multiple new businesses within a short 12 months.\n\nNotably, we were recognised by not one but two global publications as being the best in the world yet again.\n\n## An outstanding year\n\nFor the year, DBS delivered record net profit of SGD 6.80 billion, up 44%. Return on equity, at 12.5%, was the second-highest in more than a decade. These achievements were extraordinary given the near-zero interest rate environment globally, and speak to the strength of our broad-based franchise and the success of multi-year transformation efforts.\n\nWith the collapse in interest rates since the pandemic, net interest margin came under severe pressure. Even full-year loans growth at a seven-year high was unable to fully offset the\n\nimpact of lower rates, and net interest income fell to SGD 8.44 billion. We were, however, able to substantially make up for this through the strength of our fee and trading income.\n\nIn Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management, the fall in interest income was moderated by fee income. Wealth management fees, in particular, rose to a record SGD 1.79 billion as our digitalisation efforts continued to bear fruit. For example, by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and hypersonalisation, our NAV Planner tool generates more than 30 million insights each month to help customers manage their money better. Our human cum robo-advisory service, digiPortfolio, has also grown in popularity in recent years, fuelled by demand from a predominantly Gen Z/ millennial demographic. In 2021, retail investors accounted for 32% of total assets under management.\n\nInstitutional Banking did well across the board, from lending to cash management, trade finance and capital markets. Corporate lending was broad-based across geographies and industries. Cash management fees were boosted by the strength of our digital offerings, while trade finance fees benefitted from higher regional trade volumes. Investment banking fees rose on the back of a recovery in equity markets, as well as record fixed income fees as companies took advantage of the low interest rate environment to tap debt funding.\n\nTreasury Markets (TM) had another record year, with trading income of SGD 1.51 billion, up 5%. Treasury customer income, which is booked in Consumer Banking and Institutional Banking, was SGD 1.71 billion. The combined trading and customer income growth outperformed many Wall Street banks. Much of TM's success over the past two years can be attributed to its digital\n\ntransformation, enhancing its scalability, efficiency and competitiveness. For example, TM uses algorithms to offer faster and more accurate FX pricing to customers, and harnesses data to provide personalised trading recommendations.\n\nDuring the year, China's common prosperity agenda dominated headlines as its government cracked down on several industries and tempered the exuberant property market. Some banks were caught on the wrong side of these policy moves. Given our prudent risk management, DBS was able to navigate China and its idiosyncratic risks without suffering any material credit loss.\n\nFor the year, we booked just SGD 52 million in total allowances, down significantly from SGD 3.07 billion a year ago, as asset quality improved.\n\n## SGD 14.3 BILLION\n\n## SGD 6.80 BILLION\n\n## SGD 1.20\n\n## Total income\n\nTotal income remained stable despite the economic disruption caused by the pandemic.\n\n## Net profit\n\nNet profit rose 44% to a record SGD 6.80 billion, restoring a trend of consecutively higher earnings that the pandemic had disrupted in the previous year.\n\n## Dividend\n\nReturn on equity Return on equity was the second-highest in more than a decade. 12.5%\n\nWe proposed a final dividend of SGD 36 cents per share, bringing the full-year ordinary dividend to SGD 1.20 per share.\n\nIn a turbulent time, DBS continued to be recognised as a safe and trusted bank. Coupled with the strides we have made in innovating our cash management offerings, over the past two years, we benefitted from SGD 143 billion in current and savings account (Casa) inflows into the bank. Today, Casa as a proportion of total deposits is 76%, a record high, positioning us to benefit strongly when central banks start hiking interest rates in 2022.\n\n## Positioning ourselves for the future\n\nIn 2021, we made significant down payments for the future, executing several inorganic transactions and launching a multitude of new businesses that will position us well in the coming decade.\n\nThese initiatives were borne out of the 'Get Ahead' and 'Future of Work' internal taskforces that were created in the midst of the pandemic, as we sought to identify megatrends and structural shifts taking place in our industry and society-at-large.\n\n## Scaling our business in key Asian markets\n\nReflecting our belief in Asia's long-term prospects, in 2021, we capitalised on the opportunity to do several strategically important deals that will strengthen our franchise in key growth markets.\n\nIn India, we successfully amalgamated Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB). LVB gives us an enlarged footprint, particularly in southern India on",

        "page_content": "which to overlay our digital strategy. It also scales up our consumer and SME businesses significantly. Integration has progressed well, and after an initial focus on stabilising the LVB franchise, business momentum has picked up.\n\nIn Taiwan, we agreed to acquire Citigroup's Taiwan consumer banking business (Citi Consumer Taiwan). Citi Consumer Taiwan is an incredibly attractive and high-returns franchise, and widely considered to be the best foreign consumer bank in Taiwan. It will accelerate DBS Taiwan's growth by at least 10 years, making it Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets. The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings and return on equity immediately after completion, which is slated for mid-2023.\n\nIn China, we acquired a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SZRCB), becoming its largest single shareholder. SZRCB is a well-managed profitable franchise, and the investment allows us to accelerate our Greater Bay Area (GBA) strategy via Shenzhen, arguably GBA's fastest-growing city.\n\nDBS Bank (Hong Kong) received approval to offer investment products and solutions to GBA customers under the Wealth Management Connect scheme. This represents a significant opportunity given the more than six million affluent households in the GBA. Through our partnership with the Postal Savings Bank of China, one of the largest retail banks in China, we expect a quarter of DBS Hong Kong's Treasures Wealth customers to come from the GBA region over the next three years.\n\nChina's capital markets liberalisation also presents another exciting growth opportunity. To position ourselves early to capture two-way deal-flow as China opens up, we launched DBS Securities (China) Limited, a joint venture securities company, in June. Already, business has surpassed expectations - we completed five onshore capital markets transactions since starting operations, and the pipeline is robust.\n\nUnderlining our confidence in the future of Asia, DBS also committed to participating in two funds. One is the USD 500 million EvolutionX Debt Capital, which was set up with Temasek to provide non-dilutive financing to growth-stage technology-enabled companies across Asia. The other is Muzinich Asia Pacific (APAC) Private Debt I, which provides us with growth exposure to recovery opportunities in the region.\n\n## Being ahead of the curve as emerging technologies reach tipping point\n\nThe financial services industry is on the cusp of massive changes. While blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies have been in existence for some years, they are finally reaching a tipping point and creating exponential impact in areas such as trade finance and digital currencies.\n\n|\n\nDBS acquired a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank to accelerate expansion in the rapidly growing Greater Bay Area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo ensure that DBS is ahead of the curve in harnessing these technologies, we launched a number of new businesses, both on our own and in partnership with others.\n\nThey include the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), which offers tokenisation, trading and custody services of digital assets; Partior, a blockchainbased cross-border clearing and settlement provider; Climate Impact X (CIX), a global exchange and marketplace for high-quality carbon credits; and DBS Fixed Income Execution (FIX) Marketplace, Asia's first fully digital and automated fixed income execution platform.\n\nSince its launch in December 2020, DDEx has seen good business momentum, both in terms of new clients onboarded as well as assets under custody. Partior became operational in October 2021, and is in the midst of signing up banks keen to join the network. CIX goes live in Q1 2022. DBS FIX Marketplace executed 20 issuances amounting to SGD 4 billion in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, we incorporated a new company, DBS Finnovation, to house some of these new businesses. Being separately held, it provides an opportunity for us to create greater value transparency and monetise these new ventures when the time is right.\n\nWe recognise that embracing new technologies comes with some risks. We saw this in our two-day digital disruption and in the growing number of scams in Singapore. We are cognisant of these risks, and are working on strengthening the resiliency of our services and enhancing our fraud surveillance and prevention capabilities.\n\n## Building and securing a sustainability future\n\nFor a few years now, DBS has focused on advancing the sustainability agenda through responsible banking, responsible business\n\npractices and creating impact beyond banking. More recently, we established a Board Sustainability Committee to provide greater governance and oversight into climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as our broader environmental, social and governance efforts.\n\nWe felt this was important as we continued to dial up our commitments in the space, both in terms of tackling climate change as well as the growing social issues in our midst.\n\nIn 2021, DBS also became the first Singapore bank to become a signatory to the United Nations-convened, industry-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This commits us to transitioning the operational and attributable greenhouse gas emissions from our lending and investment portfolios to align with pathways to net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nIn line with this, we were also the first Singapore bank to commit to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039. Since April 2021, DBS has ceased onboarding new customers that derive more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal, and we will lower the threshold as time progresses. At the same time, we will leverage the DBS Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework to achieve meaningful decarbonisation in carbon-intensive sectors, as well as nudge more companies to embed sustainability into their business models. In 2021, DBS committed SGD 20.5 billion in sustainable financing transactions, taking our cumulative efforts to date to SGD 39.4 billion.\n\nWith Covid-19 exacerbating issues of social inequality, over the past year both DBS Bank and DBS Foundation continued to increase our support for community and social causes. Recognising that there is more we can do, the Board approved an additional SGD 100 million to be set aside to catalyse greater impact.\n\n## Transforming the way we work\n\nGiven the rapid pace of change, we believe the successful organisation of the future will have to operate very differently.\n\nIn 2021, we re-architected our most important customer processes - namely, those around credit cards, wealth management, consumer finance, foreign exchange and supply chain horizontally. We felt that if we are to be truly customer-obsessed, then we must manage by customer journeys. Given that journeys are by definition horizontal, silo-breaking cross-functional teams are best-placed to deliver differentiated customer experience and business outcomes. The horizontal organisation formalises the collaboration and joint accountability needed to maximise end-to-end customer and business outcomes. Results have been positive so far.\n\nWith Covid-19, the nature of work has also changed. Along with this, we instituted a hybrid work model where employees need only be in the office three days a week. We also availed flexiwork arrangements to those who prefer to work fewer hours. With these shifts, we reconfigured our workspaces, improving occupancy footprint efficiencies. In addition, 80,000 sq ft of our office space was turned into Joyspaces, or activity-based workplaces, in 2021. More workspaces will be transformed to allow for greater ideation and interaction in the next few years.\n\n## Recognitions\n\nIn 2021, DBS was recognised by Euromoney and The Banker as being the best in the world.\n\nIn naming us 'World's Best Bank', Euromoney said, 'Of all the banks we cover worldwide, DBS was the one that most clearly demonstrated a rare skill: not just surviving a crisis, but using it as a chance to innovate and to be a better bank. As well as fortitude and profitability, it showed opportunism and smart thinking, all underpinned by its digital leadership.'\n\nThe Banker, a leading Financial Times publication, recognised us as 'Global Bank of the Year' for 'driving a reimagination of banking as we know it today'. 'Importantly, the bank has also taken a lead in sustainable and transition financing, spearheading framework and taxonomy developments to support the shift to a low-carbon global economy. A truly forwardlooking organisation with solid foundations and a spirit of innovation,' it said.\n\nDBS was also named to the FTSE4Good Global Index and the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the fifth consecutive year.\n\n## Board and management changes\n\nDuring the year, we appointed two nonexecutive directors to the Board. They are senior civil servant Chng Kai Fong and risk management veteran Judy Lee. Kai Fong is the Second Permanent Secretary of The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group. Judy is Managing Director of Dragonfly LLC, an international risk advisory firm based in New York. Concurrently, she is CEO of Dragonfly Capital Ventures LLC, which develops and invests in renewable energy in Southeast Asia. Both are strong additions to DBS' 10-member Board.\n\nUnderscoring our deep bench strength, we filled the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) role vacated by Tan Teck Long internally. Soh Kian Tiong, who has over 25 years of experience in business and risk roles, stepped into the CRO role seamlessly in November.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board has proposed a final dividend of SGD 36 cents per share for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting. This is an increase of three cents per share from the previous payout. This will bring the dividend for financial year 2021 to SGD 1.20 per share.\n\nDBS agreed to acquire Citigroup's consumer banking business in Taiwan in January 2022, accelerating DBS Taiwan's growth by at least 10 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBarring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend going forward will rise to SGD 1.44 per share, an increase of 9%.\n\n## Going forward\n\nAt the time of writing, the world seems ready to open up and we are learning to live with Covid-19. At the same time, geopolitics is casting some shadows, and the macroeconomic policy pathways are uncertain. In such an environment, we have to continue to be watchful and nimble. We take heart that our business pipeline is robust. Importantly, we have a prudently managed balance sheet that is poised to benefit from rising interest rates.\n\nThe inorganic transactions and investments we made over the last 12 months will strengthen our franchise, and position us well to ride the crest of a structurally rising Asia. We expect payoff from these initiatives will materialise in the short to medium-term, and give us additional engines of growth.\n\nLooking further out, given that technological changes could fundamentally reshape the financial system, we must do what we can to be ahead of the curve. With DDEx, Partior and CIX, we have put some irons in the fire, and are learning by doing.\n\nIn short, while 2021 was our best-ever year, we will continue to re-position ourselves as a bank of the future.\n\nPeter Seah\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman\n\nDBS Group Holdings\n\nPiyush Gupta Chief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->",

The digitalisation capabilities we have put in place since 2014 have also enabled us to better support our customers, helping them navigate the pandemic.\n\n## NEW OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## INTELLIGENT BANKING\n\n## LEVERAGING DIGITAL\n\n## INTUITIVE AND INVISIBLE\n\n## Expanding our presence in Asia\n\n## Lakshmi Vilas Bank\n\nSince the successful amalgamation of India's Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) with DBS Bank India Limited in November 2020, we have made steady progress in growing the business. Over the past year, LVB's current and savings account balances, as well as its gold loans portfolio, have grown. Wealth management sales have also increased. Analyticsbased lending is being offered through the LVB\n\nnetwork in a phased manner.\n\n## Citigroup's consumer banking business in Taiwan\n\nTo accelerate our growth in Asia, we agreed to acquire Citigroup's consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan) in January 2022. Citi Consumer Taiwan is widely recognised as the best foreign consumer bank in the market with a high-quality customer base and top-class management team and workforce. Following the acquisition, DBS will be Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets.\n\n## DBS Securities (China)\n\nDBS Securities (China) received its securities business licence in June 2021, becoming the first Sino-Singapore securities joint venture. During the year, we successfully completed five onshore investment banking deals.\n\n## Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank\n\nDBS acquired a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SZRCB), becoming its biggest shareholder. SZRCB is a well-managed profitable franchise, and the investment allows us to accelerate our Greater Bay Area (GBA) strategy via Shenzhen, arguably GBA's fastest-growing city.\n\n## Wealth Management Connect Scheme\n\nDBS Bank (Hong Kong) is the only Hong Kong bank to partner two banks - Postal Savings Bank of China and DBS Bank (China) - in the Wealth Management Connect Scheme. Through this collaboration, we are able to tap on the expertise and network of each partner to give our customers in the Greater Bay Area access to a more diversified suite of investment products and solutions, and digital banking capabilities.\n\n## Muzinich Asia Pacific (APAC) Private Debt Fund\n\nWe became an anchor investor in private debt fund, Muzinich Asia Pacific (APAC) Private Debt I. The fund focuses on identifying special situations opportunities arising from fundamentallysound businesses that have been dislocated by pandemic disruptions, while providing them financing support to tide through these difficult times.\n\n## Enabling SMEs to access digital trade financing\n\nDigitalisation was a lifebuoy that kept SMEs afloat during the pandemic. Through our ecosystem-led platforms, we were able to digitally onboard more than 4,000 suppliers so that they could get access to digital financing solutions quickly and seamlessly throughout the pandemic. For instance, more than nine in 10 of our supply chain finance transactions were carried out through our digital platforms in 2021. We also leveraged our extensive API suite to deliver a broad array of digital trade solutions to  help our customers navigate the disruptions seamlessly.\n\n## Protecting customers with self-managed card security access features\n\nWe ramped up payments security for our 3.6 million debit and credit cardholders in Singapore, enabling them to personally manage the security access on their card accounts via a comprehensive suite of payment control features. These features, which can be conveniently accessed through the DBS/ POSB digibank app, act as multiple locks that cardholders can choose to activate in order to block unauthorised transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Making banking intelligent, intuitive and invisible\n\n## Helping customers grow their wealth with DBS NAV Planner\n\nIn 2021, we continued to improve the functionality and features of DBS NAV Planner, including leveraging artificial intelligence and hyper-personalisation technology to generate 30 million insights each month to help our customers manage their money better.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Digital assets under custody grew more than 10 times in the past 12 months to SGD 800 million. In addition, DBS Vickers, our brokerage arm, received formal approval to provide digital payment token services, enabling it to provide direct support to asset managers and companies when they trade their digital payment tokens through DDEx.\n\n## Partior\n\nWe aim to transform the future of payments through Partior, a blockchain-based cross-border clearing and settlement provider, by enabling more efficient digital clearing and settlement solutions across the banking industry. Partior went live in October 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate Impact X\n\nWe partnered Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek to set up Climate Impact X (CIX) to democratise corporate access to highquality carbon credits, offset their unavoidable carbon emissions and up the ante on efforts to scale global voluntary carbon markets. CIX is expected to go live in early 2022.\n\n## FIX Marketplace\n\nTo propel efforts to create more efficient capital markets, DBS launched Fixed Income Execution (FIX) Marketplace, Asia's first fully digital and automated fixed income execution platform. On FIX Marketplace, issuers can originate their own issuances and connect with investors directly. As at end-2021, FIX Marketplace has carried out 20 issuances amounting to SGD 4 billion.\n\n## Investing in the future of tech unicorns\n\n## EvolutionX Debt Capital\n\nTo support the development of new economy companies in Asia, we partnered with Temasek to set up EvolutionX Debt Capital. The USD 500 million growth stage debt financing platform focuses on providing financing to growth-stage technology-enabled companies across the region, with a focus on China, India and Southeast Asia.\n\n## HARNESSING\n\n## NEW TECHNOLOGY\n\nWe continue to reimagine the future of banking by pursuing new initiatives and pushing the frontiers of technology to unlock new avenues of growth.\n\n## REDEFINING BANKING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SOLUTIONS INNOVATIVE\n\n## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION",

        "page_content": "## CHAMPIONING\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nTackling climate change is a key priority, and DBS is joining global efforts to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At the same time, the pandemic has exacerbated social issues in our midst. Recognising this, we have increased our support for the community and will continue to do more going forward.\n\n## GREEN ENERGY\n\n## NET ZERO\n\n## COMMUNITY MINDED\n\n## ECO-CONSCIOUS LIVING\n\n## Shaping a more climate-aligned future\n\n## Net-Zero Banking Alliance\n\nDBS is the first Singapore bank to become a signatory to the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Banking Alliance. This reinforces our commitment to the global transition towards net zero.\n\n## Driving positive impact through sustainable finance\n\nTo reinforce DBS' efforts in responsible banking, we raised our sustainable finance target to SGD 50 billion by 2024. We aim to help more customers incorporate sustainable business practices into their overall business strategy. For instance, we partnered with one of the world's largest fashion retailers, Inditex, which owns brands such as Zara, Pull&Bear and Bershka, to launch an organic cotton procurement financing pilot programme. This enabled us to provide financing to more than 2,000 farmers in India through local Farmer Producer Organisations. With greater visibility of their cashflow, farmers can better plan for their business needs and grow their sustainable farming operations. In 2021, we committed a total of SGD 20.5 billion in sustainable financing transactions.\n\n## Broadening our suite of sustainable investments\n\nTo galvanise more wealth management clients to adopt ESG standards in their investments, DBS Private Bank has committed to growing its suite of sustainable investments, products and solutions to more than 50% of its assets under management by 2023.\n\n## Tracking steadily towards zero thermal coal commitment by 2039\n\nDBS is the first Singapore bank to commit to zero thermal coal exposure by 2039. In April 2021, we ceased the onboarding of new customers who derive more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal and will lower the threshold as time progresses.\n\n## Creating social good\n\n## Enhancing support for the community with additional SGD 100 million in funding\n\nIn 2021, DBS set aside SGD 100 million to enhance support for social enterprises (SEs) and community causes. We also doubled down on the DBS Foundation (DBSF) Grant programme, increasing our grant budget to SGD 3 million. In all, 19 SEs were selected to receive grants from DBSF to catalyse their growth for greater impact. The total number of SEs supported by DBSF grew 19% in 2021 to 824.\n\n## Donating to those hard-hit by the pandemic across the region\n\nAt the height of the pandemic, DBS marked our solidarity with colleagues, customers and the community across the region through a broad range\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Greening our environmental footprint\n\nWe are on track to achieve net-zero operational carbon emissions across the bank by 2022. DBS' four-storey office building in Newton will be transformed into a net-zero property with climate-friendly features. As at end 2021, 100% of DBS' new suppliers have committed to the bank's Sustainability Sourcing Principles.\n\n## LiveBetter\n\nTo encourage eco-conscious living, we launched LiveBetter in Singapore - a one-stop digital platform where users can easily access eco-friendly tips, donate to local green causes, and invest in sustainability-themed funds. The industry-first platform is now available to all DBS/ POSB customers in Singapore via the bank's digibank app.\n\n## Towards Zero Food Waste\n\nSince 2020, we have sought to raise awareness of the problem of food waste and rallied the community to address it. Our efforts have resulted in more than 800,000 kg of food impact across Asia to date, of which more than 600,000 kg was achieved in 2021. This comprises excess food that was redistributed, and food waste that was reduced and recycled.\n\nof relief support. This included donating oxygen concentrators and other medical supplies to India and Indonesia to aid in the fight against the pandemic.\n\n## Banking accounts for migrant workers and foreign domestic workers\n\nPOSB is the only bank to partner the Migrant Workers' Centre and Centre for Domestic Employees to set up banking accounts for more than 640,000 migrant workers and foreign domestic workers. Some 67% of them use the POSB digibank app to conduct their banking transactions today. In 2021, the number of remittances by work permit account holders grew 23%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Q1: What was the rationale behind DBS' recent acquisitions - Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank and Citi Consumer Taiwan?\n\nI have always maintained that in the long term, DBS needs to be more deeply embedded in one or more of our four markets outside of Singapore and Hong Kong, which include China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. While we are relying on digital expansion in these markets, our experience has shown that a digitalonly strategy has been difficult to monetise adequately, and a 'phygital' (digital coupled with appropriate physical scale) approach results in better customer selection and path to profitability. Building such scale through inorganic transactions has always been a consideration; unfortunately, the regulatory environment made this difficult through much of the last decade. The discontinuities of the past couple of years have provided new opportunities in this regard, and we have been fortunate to be able to use this window to make meaningful advances through three transactions.\n\nThe three transactions we did over the last 18 months - amalgamating Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) in India, acquiring Citigroup's consumer banking business in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan), and investing in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SZRCB), will position DBS well for growth as we look out into the next decade.\n\nIndia continues to be a very attractive banking market, especially in the SME and retail segments. The opportunity to serve as a 'white knight' for LVB came to us because we had chosen to establish a local subsidiary bank as the operating entity, rather than\n\n|\n\noperating through a branch. We found LVB attractive because of its deep presence in the five South Indian states, a part of the country that has attractive economic characteristics and historical connectivity to Singapore. At the same time, it gives us a presence in 42 of India's top 60 cities, improves our funding base through retail deposits, and helps us broaden our product platform through offerings like gold loans and Loans against Property. The performance in the first year post merger has been good, and we are confident that we now have a platform that will allow us rapid growth in the coming years.\n\nWhile we are cognisant of policy adjustments coming out of China, we remain committed to the market. Our strategy in China is anchored on three thrusts. First, we bank the large state-owned companies, particularly potential world-beaters with regional growth ambitions. In 2021, we added an investment banking capability through a securities joint venture so we can support these companies in their capital markets activities too. Second, in the Greater Bay Area (GBA), we want to go deeper and bank SMEs down the supply chain. Third, we are keen to expand into the consumer finance space through ecosystem partners.\n\nAcquiring a 13% stake in SZRCB allows us to accelerate our GBA strategy via Shenzhen, arguably GBA's fastest-growing city. We also see mutually-beneficial collaboration between SZRCB and our franchises in Hong Kong and China. While the stake is a minority one, it is the largest held by a single shareholder. We may have the opportunity to increase our shareholding in future as well.\n\nDBS has been in Taiwan since 1983, and while the franchise is a meaningful contributor to the Group today, adding Citi Consumer Taiwan is game-changing for a number of reasons.\n\nThe transaction will accelerate DBS Taiwan's growth by at least 10 years, making it Taiwan's largest foreign bank by assets. The combined entity will have the largest credit cards balance, investment AUM, loan book and deposit base amongst foreign banks in Taiwan. This will provide synergies from economies of scale, including reduction of global and regional overheads. Citi Consumer Taiwan's strong low-cost deposit base will also support the expansion of DBS Taiwan's institutional and SME banking business.\n\nBy 2024, we expect these transactions to add some SGD 1.2 billion-1.3 billion to our revenue base, and an incremental SGD 0.5 billion to our bottom line. They will strengthen our franchise, and position us well to ride the crest of a structurally rising Asia.\n\n## Q2: How will digital monies and decentralised finance affect the banking industry? How are you responding to them?\n\nLet me parse the question of digital currencies into the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Are we likely to see a continued reduction in notes and coins, replaced by bits and bytes? The answer to this is a clear yes. Digital money is not a new concept, whether it be through use of credit cards or wire transfers. In fact, 97% of money in circulation is digital. With the ubiquity of the mobile phone, it is quite clear that e-wallets and electronic transfers will increasingly proliferate.\n- \u00b7 Are we likely to see privately-issued digital coins (e.g. Bitcoin) take over the role of state-backed money? The answer to this is probably no. The reason for this is that money needs to have three attributes: be\n\na unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value. Privately-issued coins find it hard to attain the first two of these. The reasons for this are several. These include a lack of ubiquity, absence of faith in the 'issuer', and large volatility in value, among others. While the technology used to issue these coins (blockchain) is indeed very powerful, and does form a basis for creating immutability and transparency, the truth is that it will still be a while before the common man will universally accept this when it comes to regular monetary transactions. I also expect that regulators (and politicians) will be loath to give up control of monetary policy and economic management tools, and will therefore be very circumspect about letting private money grow. Having said this, I do think that private money (crypto) will continue to grow as a meaningful store of value, much like gold is today.\n\n- \u00b7 Are we likely to see more Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) in that case? I think this is a possibility, with 85% of central banks in the world currently studying and/ or piloting CBDCs - so the direction of travel seems clear. However, my suspicion is that the use case for cross-border settlements will be more compelling than for local settlements. When thinking of local CBDCs, central banks will wrestle with a critical question: to what extent do they want to disintermediate the extant banking system, and its role in credit creation? And if they go down an 'intermediated' CBDC approach (i.e. use the existing banking system for custody of retail CBDC wallets), do they achieve meaningful improvement over existing banking solutions?\n- \u00b7 Central banks are evaluating the potential impact of CBDCs on the efficacy of monetary policy, credit creation and availability, enabling greater financial inclusion, as well as the safety and stability of the financial system. We continue to stay close to these developments by participating in industry sandboxes and experimenting with the technology.\n\nBeyond digital currencies, another key innovation that blockchain technology has enabled is Decentralised Finance (DeFi), where tokenisation and the use of smart contracts allow peer-to-peer financial transactions without the need for intermediaries, based on self-governance by the DeFi community. This will result in a rethink of the nature and construct of existing social and economic arrangements. I believe this creates several implications, of which three points stand out in my mind.\n\n- i. The programmability of smart contracts will allow us to reimagine workflows, such as processes pertaining to settlements, AntiMoney Laundering (AML) and Know Your\n\nCustomer (KYC). This could dramatically change the structure of back-office operations by reducing costs and boosting overall efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n- ii. There will be creation of new or modified roles in this alternate financial system for existing intermediaries. In this regard, we can draw parallels to the creation of the mutual fund industry, which disintermediated commercial banking, but led to the evolution of investment banking and wealth management. In the same way, I believe there will be an evolution of existing roles in the industry. There will also continue to be a role for client ownership and management of client experiences for banks.\n- iii.   The intent of DeFi is to democratise finance by replacing centralised institutions, including government bodies. In my view, this is unlikely to occur. Going down this path will require humanity to confront the intractable but important question around the roles of the nation state, and its responsibility for the safety and stability of the financial system. My belief is that the nation state will still be a critical organising principle and will not be diminished anytime soon.\n\nWe are keeping a firm pulse on these developments, and will continue to explore ways to harness its benefits and create new opportunities and revenue streams.\n\nQ3: DBS is among the first 100 banks globally to have signed the Net-Zero Banking Alliance commitment. Are you confident of meeting this enormous commitment, and what are the steps taken so far?\n\nWe strongly believe that the climate crisis is one of the biggest challenges for mankind, and that it will take commitment and effort from all of us - individuals, governments and corporations - to find solutions that safeguard our planet and our future generations. At DBS, we have been engaged with this issue over the past few years, and have made steady progress with respect to our lending policies and our portfolio development (notably, the commitments to exit coal, and the growth of our renewables financing portfolio).\n\nThat notwithstanding, we did not sign up for the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) commitment till late last year, principally because we were reluctant to give assurances for 2050 without establishing some milestones along the way, and having some line of sight to what we can and would have to do to get there.\n\nOur confidence in meeting this ambitious goal stems from five steps we took before our pledge that establish a clear line of sight over short and medium-term milestones.\n\nThe first step was to get a better handle on the carbon intensity of our existing portfolio. While we have been reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for a few years, this has been based on a sample size of 300 to 400 customers, covering around 10% of our base. In the course of the last year, we have been able to extend coverage to close to 3,000 customers, now covering over a third of the base. We have also worked with external consultants to create quantitative models that better allow us to estimate the residual portfolio.\n\nThe second step was to get greater confidence around possible transition pathways for different industries. In our modelling, we apply scenarios which are commonly used globally, such as those from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) or the International Energy Agency (IEA). To be fair, this is still work in progress, and will undoubtedly have different textures by country. However, these pathways help guide us with respect to how much we would need to do by when.\n\nThe third step was to establish a taxonomy that precisely categorises sustainable and transition activities by sector. We embedded this in our Sustainable and Transition Finance Framework and Taxonomy document that guides our engagement with customers as we help them establish transition strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience to climate change. All of our efforts have already resulted in significantly enhanced client engagements. We made good progress in our sustainable finance business in 2021. For the year, we committed SGD 12.4 billion of sustainability-linked loans and SGD 6.9 billion of green loans. Cumulatively we have committed SGD 39.4 billion in sustainable financing transactions, against our sustainable financing target of SGD 50 billion by 2024. This was also the second consecutive year that we topped the Asia Pacific (ex-Japan) league table for arranging green and sustainability-linked loans.\n\nOur fourth step was to integrate ESG into our risk management framework and strategic planning. We are developing quantitative models to assess climate-related risks in order to do so.\n\nOur fifth step was to start actively reducing the carbon footprint in our own operations, which we will reduce to net zero by 2022.\n\nIn keeping with our commitment, we will enhance our reporting on the various measures in the coming periods to transparently update all our stakeholders on our progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPiyush Gupta\n\nChief Executive Officer DBS Group Holdings",

        "page_content": "## CFO STATEMENT\n\n'We reported record net profit of SGD 6.80 billion in 2021, restoring a trend of consecutively higher earnings that had been disrupted by the pandemic the previous year. Net profit was 44% higher than 2020 and 6% above the previous high in 2019. Return on equity was 12.5%.'\n\nWe reported record net profit of SGD 6.80 billion in 2021, restoring a trend of consecutively higher earnings that had been disrupted by the pandemic the previous year. Net profit was 44% higher than 2020 and 6% above the previous high in 2019. Return on equity was 12.5%.\n\nThe results were achieved despite a further setback of SGD 1.0 billion in net interest income due to the full impact of interest rate cuts made by central banks in response to the pandemic. Together with a reduction of SGD 1.8 billion in 2020, net interest income was set back by SGD 2.8 billion compared to 2019. In addition, we had realised SGD 0.5 billion of exceptional investment gains in 2020 as a result of market opportunities, which were not repeated in 2021.\n\nTwo factors drove the record performance.\n\nThe first was business volume growth. Loans rose 9% in constant-currency terms, the fastest since 2014. The increase was broad-based across corporate, trade, housing and wealth management loans. Fee income increased 15% to a record SGD 3.52 billion as most fee activities grew. Treasury Markets income from both trading and customer activities also reached new highs. Given the unevenness of the economic recovery, our ability to capture such diversified growth reflected not only cyclical factors but also structural improvements we made in recent years to entrench our franchise.\n\nThe second factor driving the record performance was the prudence of our risk management. We had carried out a rigorous process at the onset of the pandemic to estimate credit costs resulting from the economic disruption. The unsecured consumer, SME and several sectors among\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlarge corporates were identified to be the more vulnerable portfolios. Using various stress assumptions, we estimated total allowances to be SGD 3 billion-5 billion over 2020-21. We front-loaded the estimated charges by setting aside SGD 3.07 billion in 2020, which included SGD 1.71 billion of general allowances, to fully cover credit costs for the least-stressed scenario.\n\nAsset quality turned out better than our leaststressed scenario. With new non-performing asset formation falling to pre-pandemic levels and offset by repayments of existing nonperforming assets, non-performing assets declined 13% and the non-performing loan rate fell from 1.6% to 1.3%. Specific allowances fell by two-thirds to SGD 499 million or 12 basis points of loans, below pre-pandemic levels. The quality of our performing loan portfolio improved from repayments of weaker exposures and credit upgrades, and general allowances of SGD 447 million were written back.\n\n## Strong broad-based business momentum\n\nNet interest income fell 7% to SGD 8.44 billion due to the full impact of interest rate cuts made in March 2020. Net interest margin fell 17 basis points to 1.45%, with the majority of the decline occurring in the first half. Net interest margin stabilised towards yearend, with the 1.43% in the fourth quarter unchanged from the third quarter.\n\nBroad-based loan growth moderated the net interest margin pressure. Loans expanded 9% or SGD 34 billion to SGD 409 billion, twice our expectations at the beginning of the year. All loan categories contributed to the increase.\n\nNon-trade corporate loans grew 8% or SGD 18 billion to SGD 241 billion. The growth was diversified. More than half was from the region compared to two-thirds from Singapore in the previous year. By industry, three-fifths of the increase was in real estate for business restructuring, acquisitions and privatisations. The remainder was spread across other industries, led by technology, media and telecoms; and energy and resources. We carried out 112 sustainable loan transactions with a committed amount of SGD 21 billion, double the 54 transactions amounting to SGD 10 billion the previous year.\n\nTrade loans grew 10% or SGD 4 billion to SGD 43 billion. The growth was in line with higher regional trade activity, partially offset by lumpy repayments in the second half.\n\nHousing loans rose 5% or SGD 4 billion to SGD 79 billion. Growth in the past two years had been affected by the extended impact of cooling measures introduced in mid-2018 and by lockdowns in 2020. New bookings were strong throughout 2021 for both new launches and resale transactions, with the full-year amount rising 27% to a record.\n\nOther consumer loans increased 15% or SGD 6 billion to SGD 45 billion, led by wealth management customers.\n\nDeposits grew 7% or SGD 32 billion to SGD 502 billion. The increase was from current and savings account (Casa), which rose SGD 41 billion, enabling us to release higher-cost fixed deposits. The proportion of Casa to total deposits increased three percentage points to a record 76%. The strong Casa deposit growth reflected our longstanding dominance in savings deposits in Singapore as well as an improved Casa franchise in the rest of the group. In Hong Kong, the Casa ratio rose to 83%.\n\nSurplus deposits were placed with the central bank, which resulted in a seven-basis-point headwind to net interest margin as they yielded less than customer loans. They were however accretive to earnings and to return on equity as central bank placements did not incur any risk weights.\n\nThe larger deposit base and higher Casa ratio, together with refinements to the balance sheet, have heightened our leverage to interest rate movements. A one-percentage-point rise in USD interest rates would now increase net interest income by SGD 1.8 billion-2.0 billion compared to SGD 1.4 billion previously.\n\nThe ample liquidity resulted in a liquidity coverage ratio of 135% and net stable funding ratio of 123%, well above regulatory requirements.\n\nNet fee income rose 15% to SGD 3.52 billion. Notably, the first three quarters of the year were the three highest on record; fee income was seasonally low in the fourth quarter. Both cyclical and structural factors contributed to the growth.\n\nWealth management fees increased 19% to a record SGD 1.79 billion. While low interest rates and an improving economic outlook created a conducive environment, the growth was also due to business initiatives we undertook. We expanded our reach to the retail segment, which now contributed 15-20% of investment product and bancassurance income. Our digital platforms enabled customers to carry out transactions when face-to-face activity was restricted by lockdowns, spurring a longer-term shift to digital transactions because of their ease of use and instantaneous completion. The increased customer engagement has resulted in a higher wallet share for us. Finally, annuity products such as our discretionary portfolio service have provided new sources of income that are recurring.\n\nCard fees increased 12% to SGD 715 million as combined credit and debit card spending reached record levels even as travel spending remained subdued.\n\nTransaction service fees grew 13% to SGD 925 million, also a new high. Cash management fees were boosted by the convenience and speed of our digital platforms as well as our culture of working hand-in-hand with customers to devise solutions for their specific needs. Trade fees grew from higher regional trade volumes and supply chain financing.\n\nInvestment banking fees rose 47% to SGD 218 million. Fixed income fees reached a new high with strong issuances in a low interest rate environment. Sustainable transactions were a focus, for which we arranged 41 issues totalling SGD 23 billion to corporates, financial institutions and statutory boards. Equity market fees grew by double-digit percentages from a low year-ago base, with transactions that\n\nincluded Reits and special-purpose acquisition companies. Our China securities joint venture, which began operations in the second half, was quick off the mark with five onshore China investment banking deals.\n\nTreasury Markets trading income rose 5% to SGD 1.51 billion, while customer income grew 13% to SGD 1.71 billion. Both were at new highs. The growth was driven by expanded distribution of our digital platforms, better targeting of products to customers from data analytics and mining, and enhanced management of trading positions from algorithms.\n\nPart of Treasury Markets income was reflected under other non-interest income, which fell 5% to SGD 2.33 billion. The higher Treasury Market contributions were offset by a decline in investment gains due to a high base arising from market opportunities a year ago. Other non-interest income also included a maiden, two-month associate contribution of SGD 26 million for our 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SZRCB).\n\nBy business unit, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management income declined 8% to SGD 5.32 billion. The impact of lower interest rates was moderated by higher income from loan and deposit growth, investment products, bancassurance and cards. Institutional Banking income rose 4% to SGD 5.98 billion as the impact of lower interest rates was offset by loan and deposit growth and higher noninterest income including treasury customer sales and capital market activities. Treasury Markets trading income increased 5% to SGD 1.51 billion, double the level three to four years before, from higher contributions in a range of activities including equities and credit trading.\n\nBy region, Singapore income was impacted by lower interest rates and fell 4% to SGD 8.95 billion. Net interest margin narrowed as loans repriced in line with lower interest rates and a more liquid balance sheet was maintained. Partially offsetting the lower net interest margin were higher asset volumes and record performances in fee and trading income. Hong Kong income rose 1% in constant-currency terms to SGD 2.48 billion as higher non-interest income more than offset the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income. The increase in non-interest income was broad-based across product and customer segments. Rest of Greater China income rose 11% to SGD 1.23 billion driven by stronger wealth management and treasury customer income. South and Southeast Asia income rose 2% to SGD 1.12 billion due mainly to the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB). Organic loan-related fees and treasury customer income were also higher in India.\n\nExpenses were well managed at SGD 6.47 billion. Excluding LVB and the previous year's\n\ngovernment grants, underlying expenses were up only 1%, with the increase occurring in the second half. Base salary increments were carried out at mid-year (instead of the usual beginning of the year) after the economic recovery had taken hold. Investments for future growth were also stepped up. These cost increases were moderated by lower occupancy costs, which fell as we began rationalising our office space with the implementation of flexible work policies since end-2020. The cost-income ratio was 45%.\n\n## Asset quality improves\n\nAsset quality turned out better than we expected at the beginning of the year, when Covid-19 infections were still surging in many parts of the world. Uncertain about how loans exiting government moratoriums would perform, we had guided for total allowances of SGD 1 billion for the year. Credit quality remained benign as the year progressed, and credit costs came in well below initial guidance.\n\nAt end-2021, loans under moratorium declined to SGD 0.4 billion from SGD 13 billion the year before. Full-year new non-performing asset formation fell to pre-pandemic levels. Repayments of existing non-performing assets increased, including for oil and gas support service exposures that exceeded their writtendown values as well as the full repayment of two significant exposures in the fourth quarter. As a result, total non-performing assets fell 13% to SGD 5.85 billion, and the nonperforming loan rate improved from 1.6% to 1.3%. Specific allowances fell two-thirds to SGD 499 million or 12 basis points of loans, below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAt the same time, the quality of the performing loan portfolio improved, underpinned by stronger economic conditions. Repayment of weaker exposures, credit upgrades as well as transfers to non-performing assets resulted in a general allowance write-back of SGD 447 million. The write-backs did not touch general allowance overlays built up in previous years, which were fully maintained.\n\nWith the decline in specific allowances and writeback of general allowances, total allowances amounted to SGD 52 million for the year.\n\nAllowance reserves continued to be high. General allowance reserves amounted to SGD 3.88 billion, which were SGD 0.4 billion above the MAS requirement and SGD 1.1 billion above Tier-2 eligibility. Together with specific allowance reserves, total allowance reserves amounted to SGD 6.80 billion. Allowance coverage of non-performing assets was at 116% and at 214% when collateral was considered.",

        "page_content": "## One-time items\n\nTwo one-time items were recorded for the year. There was a gain of SGD 104 million on completion of the SZRCB transaction. There was also a contribution of SGD 100 million to the DBS Foundation and other charitable causes. We had previously set aside SGD 50 million in 2013 to establish the Foundation to further our commitment to social and community development.\n\n## Capital ratios remain strong\n\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 (CET-1) ratio rose from 13.9% to 14.4% as profit accretion outpaced risk-weighted asset growth. The leverage ratio of 6.7% was more than twice the regulatory requirement of 3%.\n\nTwo events subsequent to 31 December 2021 had an impact on the CET-1 ratio. The acquisition of Citigroup's Taiwan consumer banking business, which was announced on 28 January 2022, had an impact of 0.7 percentage points. An operational risk penalty imposed in February 2022 due to the two-day digital disruption in November 2021 had an impact of 0.4 percentage points. On the conservative assumption that the penalty is not lifted before the consolidation of the Taiwan business, and assuming no capital accretion, the CET-1 would be at 13.3%, which is at the upper end of our target operating range.\n\n## Increase in quarterly dividend\n\nWe are proposing, for approval at the forthcoming annual general meeting, a fourthquarter dividend of SGD 36 cents per share, a 9% increase from the previous payout. This will bring the dividend for financial year 2021 to SGD 1.20 per share. It would also mean that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend going forward would be SGD 1.44 per share. The increase is in line with our policy of paying sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings.\n\n|\n\n## Superior total shareholder returns\n\nWe delivered total shareholder returns of 35%, comprising share price gains and the dividend for the calendar year.\n\nOur share price rose 30%, outperforming the Straits Times Index as well as other financial sector shares on SGX. For the calendar year, we paid out a dividend of SGD 1.02 per share. For fourth-quarter 2020 and first-quarter 2021, we paid out 18 cents per share in line with an earlier guidance from MAS for banks to moderate their dividend. With the lifting of the restrictions, we reverted to our pre-pandemic payout of SGD 33 cents per share for the remaining two calendar quarters.\n\n## Outlook - cyclical factors structurally boosted by new growth engines\n\nOver the past year or so, we made several acquisitions to expand our franchise in growth markets. LVB, which was amalgamated in November 2020, provides us with an enlarged footprint and significantly scales up our retail and SME customer base in India, particularly southern India, which has extensive business and cultural ties with Southeast Asia. To position ourselves to capture two-way deal-flow as China's financial markets open further, we launched DBS Securities (China) Limited, a joint venture securities company, in June 2021. Our acquisition of a 13% stake in SZRCB, which was completed in October 2021, deepens our exposure in the Greater Bay Area. And our purchase of Citigroup's prized Taiwan consumer banking franchise in January 2022 accelerates our growth in that market by more than ten years, provides us with a solid Casa deposit base and propels us to biggest foreign bank.\n\nAt the same time, we developed new digital assets to harness the benefits of emerging technologies. The DBS Digital Exchange offers tokenisation, trading and custody services for\n\ndigital assets. Partior is a blockchain-based platform for the real-time settlement of cross-border interbank payments and aims to overcome inefficiencies in current practices. Climate Impact X is a global exchange and marketplace for high-quality carbon credits. We housed these platforms in a holding company, DBS Finnovation, to enhance transparency and better enable their future monetisation.\n\nThese new engines will provide a structural boost to our growth prospects in addition to the positive cyclical factors during the coming year. While there are risks from a US financial market sell-off and a slowdown in China, economic activity continues to pick up and borders are progressively re-opening.\n\nWe enter 2022 with healthy business pipelines. At time of writing, we are expecting loans to grow by better than mid-single-digit and fee income to grow by double-digit percentage terms. In addition, expected interest rate increases will progressively boost our earnings over time. We will continue to exercise cost discipline while investing for the future.\n\nAsset quality, which improved over the past year, is expected to remain resilient and total allowances to remain low. There are potential asset quality risks in the SME portfolio from rising interest rates, but we have repeatedly stresstested the portfolio and it is largely secured.\n\nWith a broad-based franchise that has been augmented by new growth engines, proven nimbleness in execution, a prudently managed balance sheet and cyclical tailwinds, we expect to deliver further earnings growth and shareholder returns in the coming year.\n\nChng Sok Hui Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDBS Group Holdings\n\n## (A) Digitalisation\n\nWe continued to progress our digital transformation agenda for the Consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong. In 2021, we prospectively tightened the qualifying criteria for digital customers to reflect our drive towards deeper digital engagement with customers. To be considered digital, a customer now needed to have performed at least 75% of their financial or non-financial transactions using digital channels on a rolling 12-month basis, compared with 50% previously. The change did not materially impact the comparability of 2021 metrics with those reported for previous years.\n\nThe proportion of digital customers rose to 58% in 2021, an increase of six percentage points compared with the pre-Covid year 2019. This reflected an accelerated pace of digital adoption over the Covid period as the digital customer base grew 0.5 million to 3.8 million through conversion of traditional customers and new customer acquisition.\n\nThe higher profitability and greater resilience of the digital segment became even more apparent in 2021, when the full impact of interest rate cuts made in March 2020 were acutely felt by the Singapore and Hong Kong consumer and SME businesses. The digital segment fared significantly better as it was able to mitigate the income drag from lower interest rates with its more diversified product base including wealth management, bancassurance and cards. Consequently, the reported costincome ratio of the digital segment was half that of the traditional segment in 2021. The overall Singapore and Hong Kong consumer and SME businesses continued to demonstrate cost discipline. Normalising for the effects of interest rates and government grants received in 2020, the cost-income ratio in 2021 of the overall businesses was flat to 2020.\n\nThe ROE differential between the two segments also widened substantially, with the digital segment's at 23% compared to the traditional segment's at 5%.\n\n## 2021 income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \uf075 The overall consumer and SME businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong contributed 35% of Group income , compared to 38% in 2020 as the full-period impact of interest rate cuts made in March 2020 was disproportionately felt by\n- \uf075 The digital segment continues to be material, with increasing reported share of customers (58% in 2021 reflected the greater resilience\n\nthese businesses\n\n## Cost-income ratio (%)\n\nfrom 52% reported in 2019), income (81% from 72%) and operating profit (96% from 79%).

The impact of lower interest rates was moderated by higher income from loan and deposit growth as well as wealth management and card fees. Expenses increased 2% to SGD 3.35 billion. Total allowances fell to SGD 46 million from lower specific allowances and a general allowance write-back.\n\nInstitutional Banking income rose 4% to SGD 5.98 billion as higher income from loans and deposits, treasury customer activities and capital markets offset the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses increased 5% to SGD 2.09 billion. Total allowances fell to SGD 141 million from lower specific allowances and a general allowance write-back.\n\nTreasury Markets income increased 5% to a record SGD 1.51 billion due to higher contributions from credit and equity derivatives activities. Expenses rose 2% to SGD 647 million.\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments as well as the contribution of LVB as its activities have not been aligned with the Group's segment definitions. The segment includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head office items such as centrally raised allowances. Total income fell 10% to SGD 1.48 billion due to lower gains on investment securities managed by Corporate Treasury.

Excluding the amalgamation of LVB and the previous year's government grants, underlying expenses were up by 1%. Staff costs rose from the impact of base salary increments in the second half. Investments for future growth were also stepped up. These cost increases were moderated by lower occupancy costs from the rationalising of office space with the implementation of flexible work policies.

Specific allowances fell two-thirds to SGD 499 million or 12 basis points of loans, below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRepayments of weaker exposures, credit upgrades as well as transfers to NPA resulted in a general allowance write-back of SGD 447 million. The write-backs did not touch general allowance overlays built up in previous years, which were fully maintained.\n\nWith the decline of specific allowances and write-back of general allowances, total allowances amounted to SGD 52 million for the year.\n\nAllowance reserves continued to be high.

Using machine learning, we instrumented customer feedback and transaction behaviour at scale to recommend the most relevant card products to customers. We also engaged in continuous experimentation to create a differentiated customer journey. As a result, we achieved an increase in overall digital acquisition channel share for credit cards to 88%, with growth led by Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and higher customer satisfaction in card application in these markets.\n\nTo transform the customer experience in consumer finance, we harnessed data, digital capabilities, and partnerships to enable a faster, smarter, and more seamless way to apply for a loan. Our ecosystem partnerships with lending platforms Ctrip in China and Kredivo in Indonesia contributed to significant loan growth as we offered a 100% digital and straight-through-processing (STP) loan journey from onboarding to repayment. By deploying multi-language models to obtain customer feedback at scale and running experiments on service interactions, we improved client communications and reduced the number of complaints received at our call centres across the region by almost 50%.\n\nIn wealth management, we reimagined the sales and service experience by implementing AI/ ML driven nudges that provide relevant and actionable insights for relationship managers to engage their customers, as well as enabling customers with timely information through digital channels. This led to a strong uplift of 21% in Investment & Insurance fee income in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, as well as record customer satisfaction scores in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\n| Digital Acquisition Channel Share   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Credit Card                         | 75%    | 88%    |\n| Consumer Finance (Unsecured Loans)  | 54%    | 76%    |\n| Wealth                              | 45%    | 57%    |\n\nOur efforts to accelerate customer origination, acquisition, lending, and servicing of open account trade along global supply chains through anchor and platform-led channels contributed to strong customer satisfaction scores and robust growth in relevant assets by 79% and income by 59%. Digital transactions such as supplier payment services saw a healthy uplift across Singapore, Hong Kong, China, India and Indonesia on the back of greater utilisation of digital trade solutions.\n\nOur Treasury Markets and Global Transaction Services businesses collaborated to design a seamless customer journey for transactional foreign exchange. By focusing on integrating customer journeys across our digital channels for payments and trade in foreign currency transactions, we saw foreign exchange revenues from digital channels rise by 22% in all core markets and received a strong customer satisfaction score of 4.34 out of 5.\n\nRead more about this in the Letter from the Chairman and CEO on pages 8 to 11.\n\nWe developed and implemented DDOM and HO playbooks for MtJ. We scaled training across MtJ elements for all teams and received positive ratings of 4.5 out of 5, and 9 out of 10 for the playbooks and training respectively.\n\nCritical customer journeys including credit cards, consumer finance, wealth management, supply chain, and transactional foreign exchange services were re-architected for MtJ.  We successfully rolled out MtJs for 24 customer journeys across all six core markets.  We created HOs comprising cross-functional teams with joint accountability for crucial business priorities to break silo-thinking. In addition, we designed DDOMs to identify outcome drivers, leverage AI/ML, and ensure continuous improvement through iterative experimentation.\n\nWe made good progress in the first year of a multi-year journey, and will continue to sustain the change and improve our journey architecture over the next few years.",

'\n\n## Top and emerging risks\n\nThe Board and senior management drive a robust process to identify and monitor our top and emerging risks.\n\nIn 2021, credit risk continued to be the top risk we focused on. We closely monitored our customers exiting from Covid-19 debt relief programmes or operating in vulnerable industries such as hospitality and aviation. No material adverse impact for any specific customer segments was identified. The global economy grew but at an uneven pace across countries due to differing vaccination rates and supply chain disruptions arising from the pandemic resurgence. Amid these uncertainties, our portfolios remained resilient and our specific allowances came in lower at SGD 499 million.\n\nApart from credit risk, our market and liquidity risks continued to be managed well during the year. In relation to our overall business, we also looked at (i) new business risks, (ii) technology risks, (iii) environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, (iv) financial crime risks, (v) data governance risks and (vi) cyber security and data protection.\n\n## Credit risk and portfolio management\n\nThe credit risk in our institutional banking portfolio continued to be manageable. A majority of loan moratoriums in Singapore ended during the year, with low delinquency rates observed. In Hong Kong, while loan moratoriums have been extended into 2022, credit loss is expected to be minimal given the low extension take-up rate. Our loans under\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmoratorium declined from SGD 5 billion at the beginning of 2021 to less than SGD 0.5 billion by the end of 2021.\n\nPortfolio reviews were conducted against the backdrop of the global chip shortage and energy crunch. The global chip shortage situation was partially mitigated by chip users moving from 'just-in-time' to stockpile inventory system as well as adjusting their product mix to focus on higher margin products. Many of the energy players were also assessed to be able to pass on the higher energy costs to their customers. While there were no immediate concerns, we continued to monitor the potential downstream impact.\n\nFrom a location perspective, our exposures to Singapore, Hong Kong and China constituted more than 80% of our Institutional Banking portfolio, and we were proactive in managing our risks.\n\nHeadwinds were observed as China launched regulatory crackdowns on its technology sector. A number of Chinese real estate developers also experienced liquidity crunches or defaulted on their debt. While the equity prices of Chinese technology players declined significantly, the major technology players' underlying business models remained viable with strong cashflow generation capability. Our Chinese technology and real estate portfolios were assessed to be stable as our exposures were mainly to larger and investment-grade names, with the remaining exposure generally well-secured.\n\nIn Indonesia and India, the resurgence of Covid-19 cases due to the Omicron strain resulted in restrictions in activities. Our portfolio primarily comprised lending to large corporates and remained resilient.\n\nOur overall consumer credit quality remained healthy. Residential mortgages in our consumer banking business are primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, the majority of which are for owner occupation. Overall, our mortgages are mostly well-secured with relatively low loan-to-value ratios. Unsecured consumer credit loans constituted less than 2% of the bank's total loan exposure.\n\nLooking ahead, US-China tensions and the uneven economic recovery across the world are also likely to persist. Given the challenges, we will continue to exercise prudence in our client selection and credit underwriting criteria.\n\nBesides actively managing our portfolio risks, we enhanced our internal risk management tools to improve the quality of our risk management capabilities. We concluded our multi-year credit architecture programme journey which put in place a robust credit risk data infrastructure and workflow management system across the Group, underpinned by modern technology architecture to support our Institutional Banking business. We also developed credit underwriting models that enabled the start of our consumer finance business in China as well as pre-emptive lending models to further entrench our digital bank leadership in Singapore. On the risk monitoring front, we rolled out early alert models to address specific credit risks arising from Covid-19 relief programmes and introduced tools to automate and identify specific portfolio risks arising from emerging macro risks.\n\n## New business risks\n\nDuring the year, DBS launched Partior (blockchain-based cross-border clearing and\n\nsettlement provider) and Climate Impact X (carbon exchange), in addition to the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) set up in 2020. A risk management and governance framework was put in place to oversee our new businesses. An accountable executive is also identified for each major new business to ensure clarity of accountability and responsibility. Material risks are identified at inception of each business and the appropriate risk committees updated. Where we are the majority shareholder, the risks are reviewed as part of the bank's risk governance framework.\n\nPost amalgamation with Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) in 2020, we strengthened the risk organisation at LVB and folded it in to the overall DBS India Limited (DBIL) risk framework and oversight. The integration of LVB's operating systems and network into DBIL is well underway and will be completed by Q3 2022.\n\n## Technology risks\n\nOur technology risk management framework is an integral part of the bank's overall risk management approach. The framework is based on a three-pronged approach of risk evaluation, response and governance. As part of risk evaluation, we identify and analyse the risks, define the risk metrics and monitor the issues, risk events and key risk indicators. Responses are made through risk-based decisions taking into account risk control and mitigation measures. Updates on our technology risk profiles are provided regularly to the various risk committees.\n\nIn November 2021, we encountered a two-day digital disruption in Singapore. In relation to this incident, management initiated remedial measures to improve the resilience of our services and incident response, with due consideration given to regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\nRead more about our technology transformation in the 'CIO Statement' on pages 36 to 37.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks\n\nAssessment of ESG risks is embedded into our credit underwriting process with emphasis on climate risk, and is an integral part of our overall credit risk assessment framework. In 2021, we strengthened the criteria for underwriting transactions with adverse ESG considerations.\n\nWe have in place a Group Sustainability Council which oversees sustainability matters, and in 2021, a Climate Steering Committee was established to further strengthen the bank's climate risk management, focusing on governance, client engagement, climate risk policy and underwriting, stress testing\n\nand disclosure. We also recently established a Board Sustainability Committee to provide greater governance and oversight into climaterelated risks and opportunities, as well as our broader ESG efforts.\n\nRead more about 'Responsible financing' in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Financial crime risks\n\nThe financial crime risk mitigation programme had been enhanced over the years by leveraging technology and data analytics. An array of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities is used to supplement rules-based engines to conduct surveillance at different levels such as transaction, customer, and country levels. Customer due diligence was further refined with dynamic analytical reviews based on changes in static data or transactional behaviour. We continued to focus on public-private sector collaboration, actively participating in initiatives between financial institutions and law enforcement agencies.\n\nDigital scams in Singapore are becoming more sophisticated and widespread at the national level, with relentless attempts by scammers seeking to exploit unsuspecting victims. We have implemented multi-pronged measures to strengthen fraud prevention and recovery measures including real-time blocking capabilities, loss recovery and customer communication/ education. We are also collaborating with national agencies to protect our customers.\n\n## Data governance risks\n\nWe recognise that responsible practices around data governance are key for customer and stakeholder trust. Our data governance framework was developed along the following three prisms: (a) a baseline prism encompassing data security, data quality, and legal and regulatory compliance, (b) an ethical prism - PURE (Purposeful, Unsurprising, Respectful and Explainable) - for the responsible use of data, and (c) a model governance prism, covering regulated and artificial intelligence models and their performance over time.\n\n## Cyber security and data protection\n\nCyber security risk is an evolving risk as the bank and our customers establish remote workings as the new working norm in the face of the pandemic. We continued to invest in our cyber defence capabilities to secure internal assets from emerging cyber threats, and strengthen our ability to detect and respond to the threat actors' modus operandi. We stayed vigilant as we broadened our\n\necosystem partnerships, vendor support, and service provider engagements. Cyber security experts were engaged to validate our control environment against cyber threats and thirdparty risks. We believe our people are an integral part of our cyber defence, and we stepped up our efforts to raise the security awareness of our staff on the prevailing cyber threats and scams.\n\n## Operational risks amidst Covid-19 disruptions\n\nWe continued to proactively manage the operational risks which arose from the new or modified processes during the pandemic and as we moved towards a hybrid work arrangement. Risk identification and assessment processes were put in place to identify risks and assess adequacy and sustainability of controls in the new/ modified processes so as to ensure the risks were adequately mitigated. We also continued to work with our material outsourced service providers to ensure service delivery was not adversely impacted.\n\nRead more about our principal risks and risk management approach on pages 78 to 96.\n\nSoh Kian Tiong Chief Risk Officer DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOCUS AREAS 2   22\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to refine and streamline end-toend credit processes across all markets\n- \u00b7 Further deepen credit and portfolio management capabilities\n- \u00b7 Continue to monitor material risks arising from new businesses\n- \u00b7 Sharpen focus on SME portfolio in light of inflationary pressure and rising interest rates\n- \u00b7 Enhance IT resilience and technology change management\n- \u00b7 Enhance climate risk management capabilities and disclosure\n- \u00b7 Mitigate financial crime risk\n- \u00b7 Continue to strengthen multi-layered cyber security defence",

        "page_content": "## CIO STATEMENT\n\n'Our strong technology DNA, suite of digital assets, products and services, and early technology investments, have created further distance between us and our competitors, and have allowed us to move into a new chapter of transformation.'\n\nIn the last decade, we focused on technology transformation to build a robust and scalable foundation. The Covid-19 pandemic validated our strategy. At the onset of the pandemic, our staff swiftly switched to remote working without any loss of productivity, continued delivering on our book of work and experimented with emerging technologies such as 5G, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain. We doubled down on our technology investments to create further distance between us and our competitors, which allowed us to move into a new chapter of transformation to deliver superior customer experiences.\n\nOur forays in this digital era are underlined by the versatile assets we create, our technology DNA, the technologists we have, and our ability to provide sustainable banking experiences. It would be apt to identify DBS as a technology company that holds a banking licence.\n\n## Disrupting the financial industry with our digital assets\n\n## Translating emerging technologies into business solutions and services\n\nOur early adoption of blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and IoT a few years ago allowed us to reap the fruits of our labour. Through experimentation with and adoption of emerging technologies, we successfully developed a suite of scalable assets and achieved further breakthroughs.\n\nWe set up three blockchain-enabled businesses, DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx), Partior and Climate Impact X (CIX), housed under our DBS Finnovation subsidiary.\n\nDDEx reimagines what capital markets could look like with an integrated digital asset\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\necosystem. We are the only bank that offers a unified suite of solutions including deal origination, tokenisation, listing, trading and digital asset custody.\n\nBy harnessing the benefits of smart contracts abilities, Partior enables banks worldwide to provide real-time cross-border multi-currency payments, trade finance, foreign exchange and Delivery versus Payment securities settlements on an open industry platform, with programmability, immutability, and traceability built into it.\n\nCIX, which uses technological advances such as satellite monitoring and machine learning, aims to be the leading global exchange and marketplace for high-quality carbon credits. Last November, CIX completed its firstof-its-kind portfolio auction with industry changemakers.\n\nJust as we experimented with blockchain while the technology was still nascent, in a similar vein, we are exploring initiatives relating to the metaverse, decentralised finance, tokenisation beyond financial assets and digital twin technology. As these technologies mature and more use cases develop, they, along with other emerging capabilities, will become major enablers of our business opportunities.\n\n## Building our technological muscle\n\nRiding on the momentum of our digital transformation journey that began about a decade ago, we invested in three strategic technology capabilities: Cloud, AI/ Machine Learning (ML) and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). We continue to rely on today's cuttingedge technologies to scale new heights and revolutionise the future of banking.\n\n## Leveraging the power of cloud\n\nOur move to a hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure resulted in greater resiliency, scalability, reduced infrastructure costs, and the flexibility to move between cloud computing models and service providers. Unlike most organisations that completely shifted to public cloud, we managed to achieve better results by re-engineering our existing private cloud. With aggressive automation, we are three times more efficient than the industry benchmark when it comes to managing virtual machines, and our cloud efficiency has the ability to undertake four times the workload of a typical bank on a single hardware.\n\nRiding on our private cloud infrastructure, we deployed workloads onto the public cloud at scale in a safe and secured manner. We developed Evolve, a tool that allows developers to obtain products and services on a selfservice basis, and apply pre-determined, in-built controls and best practices during application deployment, resulting in rapid application builds, simplified operations and faster time-to-market solutions.\n\nDBS' holistic approach to public cloud adoption is a major enablement to the bank and our joint ventures, from advancing data agenda and IT implementation, to application onboarding. Our digital assets can be readily utilised in businesses outside of ours.\n\n## Being an AI-fuelled bank\n\nWith our cloud approach setting the right infrastructure for growth and scalability, we have developed numerous cutting-edge programmes in-house. Our internal, selfservice data platform, ADA (Advancing DBS with AI), is a single source of truth that ensures governance, discoverability, quality, and security. ADA's usage saw exponential growth\n\nbank-wide in 2021, and it supported initiatives that generated close to SGD 100 million in impact on our top and bottom lines.\n\nOur award-winning AI protocol and knowledge management hub helped scale AI/ ML practices at an enterprise level, and accelerated delivery to deployment time by 60%. Our Enterprise Data Security Framework engine addresses the paramount need to secure data accesses while using cloud frameworks. Its role-based access control capability holds its own weight among technological giants like Google, Apple, Amazon and LinkedIn.\n\n## Developing and scaling robust and resilient systems through SRE\n\nInspired by the global technological giants, adopting SRE practices has allowed us to manage complex systems in a resilient manner. Developing a strong suite of SRE assets inhouse enabled us to drive automation and reliability at scale in 2021. DRONE, our in-house developed DBS Release and Orchestration Engine, serves over 33,000 deployments monthly, and has reduced our average deployment time by half. Another platform DARE, or DBS Auto Remediation Engine, automates application recovery when preidentified failure scenarios are met. To date, it has been adopted by over 85 applications, improving their recovery times substantially.\n\nWhile our SRE programmes are primarily designed for in-house developed applications, we need to consciously extend such practices to our third-party software vendors and service providers. We hit a bump in our transformation journey when we experienced a two-day digital disruption in November 2021. We take this very seriously, and are working on a series of remedial actions to review and improve the resilience of our services and incident response. Concurrently, we continue to strengthen our systems to fortify our infrastructure and to enhance our customer journeys.\n\n## Re-engineering our operations through technology\n\nIn this era of digital banking, it is imperative to digitalise and automate operations processes to provide prompt and joyful servicing and products to customers. We have made substantial progress in these areas and improved our baseline and time to market. The synergy between Business, Operations and Technology teams co-leading the transformation of operations and customer servicing under our Platform Operating Model, has provided differentiated digital customer and employee journeys.\n\nWe successfully provided seamless connectivity from inception to fulfilment, enabling consistent role-based access to employees on the systems they operate on. Through the re-use of digital assets and processes,\n\nwe standardised the blueprint of our bestin-class workflows and streamlined and automated customers' requests to recommend appropriate products and services. This approach will be scaled up across all markets in 2022 as we focus on establishing a hassle-free network of workbenches and workflows.\n\nThis network will refine employee journeys and provide a more productive experience. Manual handoffs will be minimised; transactions can be traced and audited; while systems, which will be available regardless of location, will facilitate job sharing as we scale our Work-FromAnywhere initiative and expand our global talent pool.\n\n## Building a diverse and futureready workforce\n\nDBS technologists form more than 25% of our workforce. Our digital DNA enables us to keep up with the lightning-speed evolution of technology. At the same time, gender-inclusive initiatives such as DBS Women-in-Technology and Hack2Hire-Her have also successfully increased our family of female technologists. Today, 40% of our senior management positions (Senior Vice President and above) are held by women.\n\nOur employees are provided with numerous opportunities to future-proof themselves. Since 2021, over 1,000 technologists have been upskilled through learning gamification to support the rapidly increasing demand for cloud technologies.\n\n## Banking sustainably in a digital world\n\nBy keeping a pulse on trends and identifying emerging technologies, we are able to create holistic solutions and innovations for a better society. As part of our aspiration for our Singapore offices to rely solely on renewable energy by 2030, our data centre and server rooms are being transformed into carbon neutral assets, while self-service branches and kiosks are being redesigned to leverage solar power for its energy needs.\n\nThe switch to electric vehicles for Cash and Valuables Escort services reduces CO2 equivalent by up to 17 tonnes per vehicle annually. We committed to ensuring net-zero operational carbon emissions across the bank by the end of 2022 and are on track to reduce our operational carbon footprint by 25% from 2020 levels.\n\nOur office building in Newton, Singapore, is being transformed into a net-zero emissions development. Our Singapore, Taiwan, India and Indonesia markets have collectively increased their renewable energy usage by 7%.\n\n## In closing\n\nWe set a strong foundation and expanded our line-up of digital assets, products and services in the past decade. That is one aspect of growth; it is equally important to address the other side of the coin, that is, how we bounce back from adversity. Success is rarely a straight path, and bumps along the way are an integral part of the journey. They have not deterred us in our quest to becoming a leading technology-led business; instead, they have strengthened our resolve to emerge stronger and to continue forging ahead.\n\nWe will continue to augment our heritage as a purpose-driven bank by creating long-term positive impact for our customers, employees, and community. We work hard to build today, for tomorrow.\n\nJimmy Ng Chief Information Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDBS Group Holdings\n\n## FOCUS AREAS 2   22\n\n- \u00b7 Externalise strengths and enable partners to leverage our digital assets\n- \u00b7 Enable adoption at scale for hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure\n- \u00b7 Modernise applications, enhance existing suite of SRE enablers, and execute on the last mile of mainframe decommission\n- \u00b7 Experiment with emerging technologies such as 5G, IoT, metaverse and DeFi\n- \u00b7 Accelerate data ingestion on Data Platform and move it securely to public cloud\n- \u00b7   Scale workflows and workbenches bankwide under a horizontal organisation construct\n- \u00b7 Enhance employee journeys and experiences through automation of systems and processes, and toil reduction agenda\n- \u00b7 Enhance talent acquisition pipeline, strengthen Technology Employee Value Proposition and drive extensive futureready training in line with world-class engineering companies",

Sustainable financing will remain a key priority as we work with customers to redirect capital towards more sustainable outcomes.'\n\n## 2021 overview\n\nIn 2021, the global economy saw uneven recovery across different markets. IBG overcame headwinds from a low interest rate environment and achieved broad-based growth through an unrelenting focus on customers, ecosystems and partnership strategies.\n\nAs global trade rebounded, we saw increased client activities, loan demand, deal flows and capital market volumes. The digital acceleration that started last year continued and we saw good traction on the usage of our digital tools and applications.\n\n## Steady performance amidst pandemic\n\nIBG delivered solid revenue of SGD 5.98 billion, up 4%, supported by broad-based loan growth and record current and savings account (Casa) volumes. Record Casa volumes were achieved as clients recognised the value of our digital innovations, cash management solutions and safe franchise. Amidst a low interest rate environment, net interest income was stable at SGD 4 billion.\n\nWe registered record non-interest income, up 13% and achieving the SGD 2 billion mark for the first time. Allowances were below prepandemic levels owing to heightened credit vigilance through proactive and continuous monitoring of our portfolio. Profit before tax grew 65% to SGD 3.76 billion, primarily driven by lower allowances. The cost-income ratio was little changed at 35%.\n\nThere was strong broad-based growth across most industries, with Financial Institutions (FI), Technology, Media and Telecommunications, and Real Estate industries demonstrating particularly good momentum. In particular, our FI business registered double-digit growth in revenues\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nacross all key capital markets of Singapore, United Kingdom (UK) and Greater China, primarily through targeted expansion of our FI customer base and deepening relationships with institutional investors looking to invest in Asia.\n\nWe executed well on our market strategies. In Greater China, we sharpened our Greater Bay Area strategy to capture business flows from new industries, promoted sustainable financing and continued to embed our trade and financing solutions deeper into supply chains, with a focus not just on large corporates, but SMEs as well. We also strengthened client relationships in Taiwan.\n\nOur business in India saw strong traction as we focused on deepening relationships and delivering valuable solutions to help our clients succeed. To better serve them, we introduced platform-based financing programmes, offshore treasury and market solutions, as well as digital collection and payment solutions. As a result, revenues from India grew 21%. We expect these efforts to drive meaningful future growth.\n\nOutside core markets, our business saw steady momentum as we focused on driving new client acquisitions through differentiated capabilities in supply chain, digitalisation and sustainability. We registered a 12% increase in income led by the UK, Australia and Vietnam.\n\n## Fortifying our business for the future\n\nEven as we scale our business across the region, we are innovating and building for the future. We identified key trends such as hyper-digitalisation, supply chain shifts and an increased focus on sustainability which would re-shape the post-pandemic economy.\n\nTo capture rising venture capital flows across the region, we beefed up our proposition in the digital economy space. Our Digital Economy\n\nGroup and FI Group plugged into the startup and private equity ecosystem across the region to identify opportunities to nurture and finance the growth of Asia's future unicorns. This was well-received by digital economy companies, entrepreneurs and investors, and we won multiple mandates to support leading digital economy players throughout our key markets. We supported our long-time customer, Carro, with a range of auto facilities and increased our limits for a block discounting facility to support its strong growth.\n\nWe also partnered Temasek to jointly launch a USD 500 million growth debt financing platform, EvolutionX Debt Capital, to provide non-dilutive financing to growth-stage technology-enabled companies across Asia.\n\nWe expect to leverage on our Securities Business licence granted by the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission to provide best-in-class onshore investment banking products and services for both domestic and international customers.\n\nOur digital asset ecosystem anchored by the DBS Digital Exchange (DDEx) gained good traction since its launch in 2020. We closed the year with over SGD 800 million in digital assets in our digital custodial services.\n\n## Treasury Markets - Tapping new opportunities\n\nWe launched DBS Fixed Income Execution (FIX) Marketplace, Asia's first fully digital and automated fixed income execution platform, to empower issuers to directly engage the market and investors. Keppel Corporation self-executed the first tranche of its USD 1 billion EuroCommercial Paper Programme with its maiden issuance on the platform. As at end 2021, 20 issuances amounting to SGD 4 billion were done on FIX Marketplace.\n\n| SGD million              | 2021   | 2020   | YoY%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income             | 5,984  | 5,745  | 4      |\n| \u00b7  Corporate             | 4,305  | 4,028  | 7      |\n| \u00b7  SME                   | 1,679  | 1,717  | (2)    |\n| Expenses                 | 2,086  | 1,987  | 5      |\n| Profit before allowances | 3,898  | 3,758  | 4      |\n| Allowances               | 141    | 1,485  | (91)   |\n| Profit before tax        | 3,757  | 2,273  | 65     |\n\nTo further capitalise on growth opportunities arising from the pandemic, DBS entered into an agreement to be an anchor investor in Muzinich Asia Pacific (APAC) Private Debt I, a private debt fund focused on special situations opportunities in Asia Pacific. DBS was also the first bank in Asia to be issued a membership with the London Metal Exchange outside of London, enhancing our support to corporate clients in Asia accessing an international, robust, and regulated metals market. Revenues for our TM business grew by a record 13%.\n\n## Leadership in capital markets\n\nDBS remained in pole position in Singapore's equity space, advising and lead managing the largest number and value of equity deals on the SGX, accounting for 95% of the total equity proceeds from the Singapore market. We continued to play a dominant role in growing Singapore as an international financial centre for REITs and business trusts, contributing close to 90% of the total equity proceeds raised from the REIT market.\n\nDBS continued to dominate the SGD bond market with close to SGD 18.9 billion in issuances and around 31% market share. We continue to make headway in the Asia ex-Japan G3 bond markets with issuances of close to USD 73 billion.\n\nWe were ranked by Bloomberg as the top advisory house in Singapore and second in Southeast Asia for mergers and acquisitions by transaction value. Key deals included CapitaLand's strategic restructuring where we served as sole financial advisor.\n\n## SMEs - Supporting them as they recover and grow\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, we proactively engaged SMEs to extend working capital and business transformation support. Since 2020, DBS has approved over 14,000 collateral-free loans totalling more than SGD 6.4 billion to SMEs in Singapore, with over 90% of the loans going to micro and small enterprises.\n\nIn Singapore and India, we simplified processes where our online corporate account opening process for SMEs made use of facial biometrics to speed up information authentication and verification.\n\n## Executing on our ecosystems strategy\n\nThrough our ecosystem-led platforms, we onboarded more than 3,000 suppliers to expedite access to financing solutions, without the hassle of manual paperwork. We also expanded our platform and ecosystem partnerships and leveraged alternate lending solutions for trade to provide working capital to SMEs, merchants and suppliers. Our Supply Chain Finance assets grew 44%.\n\nTrade fees benefited from higher regional trade volumes and fulfilment of pent-up demand. Corporate Trade Services grew 19% driven by strong momentum in structured and commodity trade.\n\nOverall, transaction services fees were up 13% to a new high of SGD 925 million from growth in trade finance and cash management fees.\n\nIn recognition of our efforts, DBS achieved the Euromoney Cash Management Survey 2021 'Global Best Service Overall' accolade among corporates for the fourth consecutive year, and 'Asia-Pacific Market Leader Overall' among financial institutions.\n\n## Committed to sustainable financing\n\nWe made good progress in growing our sustainable finance business during the year, committing SGD 12.4 billion of sustainabilitylinked loans and SGD 6.9 billion of green loans. Since 2018, we have completed SGD 39.4 billion in sustainable financing transactions, bringing us closer to our SGD 50 billion sustainable finance target by 2024. In addition, we raised more than SGD 23.5 billion in ESG bonds for our customers in 2021 - more than double the proceeds raised the previous year. Our commitment to clients' sustainability fundraising needs catapulted us to pole position in South and Southeast Asian Offshore ESG Bonds League Tables for 2021.\n\nWe arranged National Environment Agency's SGD 1.65 billion inaugural bond issuance, the largest by a Singapore statutory board, contributing towards Singapore's ambition of becoming the green finance capital of Asia.\n\nAs a testament to our leadership in sustainable financing, sustainable loans, green and social\n\nbonds, we won eight out of 10 segment awards in Global Finance's inaugural Sustainable Finance Awards.\n\n## A smooth IBOR transition\n\nWith the discontinuation of interest rate benchmarks such as the London Inter-bank Offered Rate and Swap Offer Rate, DBS has been partnering our clients to achieve a smooth and seamless transition to alternative Risk-Free Benchmark Rates.\n\nWe achieved many firsts for Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA)-pegged facilities in Singapore, including the SGD 500 million SORA-based sustainability-linked loan to Sembcorp Marine Financial Services, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Sembcorp Marine.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nCovid-19 remains a lingering threat to economic recovery. However, we are optimistic that business momentum will be sustained in the coming year. The pick-up in interest rates and a largely positive credit environment should bode well for our bottom-line. We will continue to focus on capturing cross-border trade recovery, tapping on our strong foundation in digital transformation, regional connectivity, and industry expertise. Sustainable financing will remain a key priority as we work with customers to redirect capital towards more sustainable outcomes.\n\nTan Su Shan Institutional Banking DBS Group Holdings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOCUS AREAS 2   22\n\n- \u00b7 Differentiate DBS as a leader in sustainable finance\n- \u00b7 Capture cross-border and trade recovery\n- \u00b7 Deliver on digital leadership from API and connectivity solutions\n- \u00b7 Continued credit vigilance, KYC/ AML and credit processes",

In 2022, we will continue to create and support innovative solutions that yield positive impact.'\n\n## 2021 Overview\n\nIn a year marked by continued headwinds from Covid-19, low interest rates and market uncertainties, Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management demonstrated its resilience by delivering healthy results. This was a result of our disciplined cost management, increased productivity through digitalisation and pivot towards fee income. As business momentum grows and the economic recovery takes hold, we continue to build out our franchise footprint and grow our ecosystem and partnership plays, so our customers can bank seamlessly with us, wherever they are.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management: Strong fee income growth cushions macro impact\n\nDespite the drag from 2021 headwinds, we were nevertheless able to deliver robust earnings for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management with higher non-interest income and lower allowances. Our total income came in at SGD 5.32 billion, a fall of 8% against last year, while strong cost discipline kept our expenses flat. Net profit before tax fell 5% to SGD 1.92 billion.\n\nNet interest income fell 24% to SGD 2.55 billion as the low interest rate environment extended into 2021. The impact was moderated by the strong recovery in Singapore housing loans and we maintained our lead in mortgage market share. We continue to be circumspect about providing unsecured loans amid the challenging environment which resulted in lower balances in Singapore and Indonesia.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-interest income was strong, rising 14% to SGD 2.77 billion. Income was buoyed by higher fees from investment, bancassurance and cards, as consumer spending began its return to pre-pandemic levels, and investments continued to climb across our key markets, growing by 14% and reaching SGD 2.22 billion in record income.\n\nThe bancassurance business saw doubledigit growth and maintained its leading new business market share in Singapore. Annualised premium sales in our life insurance business reached more than SGD 1.04 billion in new sales volume, with general insurance premiums growing by more than 19%.\n\nOverall, we see promising signs of recovery in the region and are well-placed to support our customers.\n\n## Wealth Management: Growing to new heights\n\nOur wealth management franchise continued to build on last year's strong fee income performance, with non-interest income rising 17% to SGD 1.88 billion. Investment AUM increased by 20% to SGD 153 billion and total AUM rose 10% to SGD 291 billion. Overall, wealth management income declined 5% to SGD 2.73 billion as net interest income fell 32% to SGD 848 million due to net interest margin compression. The wealth franchise now represents 19% of group income.\n\nWe continued to grow the range and diversity of our wealth products, with 2021 being a transformative year for our in-house managed investment products. The launch of DBS Barbell Income Fund, DBS I.D.E.A Fund and DBS ESG Focus Note drove robust funds growth and revenues, and AUM from in-house managed\n\ninvestment products more than doubled to SGD 10 billion. Our alternatives proposition was also strengthened with expanded offerings from toptier private equity (PE) fund managers, increased deal flow in our PE Access programme, and the establishment of the PE Hybrid platform which combines referral and custody.\n\nWe also expanded into the mass affluent segment with our unique DBS Treasures proposition in Singapore, which provides access to our industry-leading digital platform, sophisticated offerings and holistic approach to wealth management across investments, protection, legacy planning, liability management, and more.\n\nIn May, we introduced Asia's first bank-backed trust solution for cryptocurrencies via DBS Trustee for private banking clients. The offering builds on DBS Digital Exchange's proposition, providing security and transparency for cryptoassets with institutional-grade safekeeping and custodial services, and robust due diligence on the chain source. The solution enables clients to integrate cryptocurrency assets into their wealth succession plans.\n\nIn October, our Hong Kong franchise and Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC) launched a partnership to participate in the Wealth Management Connect scheme. The partnership aims to contribute to the acceleration of economic development in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) by leveraging the advantages of both banks to bring geographical and risk diversification to investment portfolios of GBA customers. The partnership will introduce an entirely mobilefirst digital customer journey, from applying for the account to transacting investments and monitoring portfolios.\n\n| SGD million              | 2021   | 2020   | YoY%   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total income             | 5,322  | 5,767  | (8)    |\n| \u00b7  Retail                | 2,593  | 2,902  | (11)   |\n| \u00b7  Wealth Management     | 2,729  | 2,866  | (5)    |\n| Expenses                 | 3,353  | 3,288  | 2      |\n| Profit before allowances | 1,969  | 2,479  | (21)   |\n| Allowances               | 46     | 456    | (90)   |\n| Profit before tax        | 1,923  | 2,023  | (5)    |\n\nOur wealth management business was also recognised in 2021 as 'Most Innovative Private Bank in the World', 'Best Private Bank for Use of Technology' and 'Best Private Bank for Digital Client Solutions' by Global Finance, and 'Best Private Bank for Family Offices - Asia' by Professional Wealth Management.\n\n## Consumer Banking: Becoming more intelligent, intuitive and invisible\n\nWe aim to become an intelligent banking (IB) powerhouse that delivers hyper-personalised advisory and engagement to our customers. IB harnesses advanced analytics, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to deliver insights and 'nudges' to our customers through our digital channels, to simplify banking and help customers better manage their money. The introduction of IB has also resulted in incremental revenue, with more than 30 million nudges generated every month to customers across our six key markets.\n\nIn April, DBS NAV Planner, one of the world's most advanced financial planning solutions, added an AI-powered digital investment advisory feature to help investors determine and meet regulatory requirements, before investing amid market volatility. This led to a four-fold increase in customers who completed their investment journeys. AUM of digitally-managed investments (digiPortfolio, InvestSaver ETFs and online unit trusts) also grew by 52%. DBS NAV Planner now has 2.6 million users and is part of our commitment to help one million customers get insured and invested by 2023. It also garnered 80% of participants on SGFinDex - the world's first public-private open banking initiative.\n\nWe continue to build on DBS digibanking, our digital banking proposition which provides two intuitive apps to fulfil all our customers' banking and lifestyle needs. Customers can conduct their everyday transactions via DBS PayLah! - which is partitioned from banking accounts and easily switch to DBS digibank for banking, for greater security and peace of mind. DBS PayLah! can be used to book tickets and rides, pay expenses, access rewards, and to scan to pay at more than 180,000 points. In 2021, DBS PayLah!, which now has 2.2 million users, added Takashimaya and Shopee as partners. Transactions have also surged by 69%.\n\nDBS Remit saw another year of exceptional growth, with remittance volumes rising 24%. From Singapore, customers can remit to more than 50 destinations in 19 currencies, on a near real-time or same-day basis with no fees. DBS Remit is also available to customers in Hong Kong, India and Indonesia.\n\nWe launched our digital consumer finance platform in China in 2021 with promising early results. We have integrated with two major ecosystem platforms and plan to add more strategic partners. Our partnership-led strategy gives us access to China's large and growing consumer lending market even as we evolve our data analytical capabilities to enhance customer engagement and our offerings. Within the first year of business launch, we have digitally disbursed more than SGD 700 million in loans.\n\nThe amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) into DBS Bank India Limited has been successful and integration continues to be on track, having achieved our first-year targets. LVB's expanded branch network and larger retail customer base - where we can overlay our world-class digital banking and build a sticky deposit base - has improved the mix of our deposit and loan books. We maintain our expectations of being earnings accretive within three years.\n\n## Helping customers to live more sustainably\n\nTo encourage customers to adopt sustainable living habits, we rolled out a slew of green offerings in 2021. We introduced DBS Green Solutions, a suite of green retail offerings which includes a green renovation loan, incentives to switch to green energy and Singapore's first green car loan. DBS was also the first in Singapore to launch an eco-friendly credit card. The DBS Live Fresh card is made of recycled PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and rewards sustainable purchases.\n\nIn March, in line with our sustainability agenda, DBS Private Bank committed to have more than 50% of our AUM in sustainable investments defined as rated BBB and above by MSCI ESG Ratings - by 2023. Following efforts to guide and engage clients on sustainable investing, client interest surged and this target was quickly met in October, two years ahead of time. AUM\n\nin sustainable investments now comprises 53% of our portfolio.\n\nIn June, DBS Indonesia introduced the Green Savings Account, where customers can contribute towards a sustainability cause by automatically donating a portion of their savings interest. Run in partnership with social enterprise KRAKAKOA, all donations collected are distributed in the form of fertilisers and seeds, and sustainability training for 1,000 cocoa farmers in Indonesia.\n\nIn October, we launched LiveBetter - a onestop digital platform integrated into DBS digibank where customers can easily access eco-friendly tips, donate to green causes and invest in sustainability-themed funds. In 2022, LiveBetter will also have the industry's first autonomous carbon calculator. It automatically generates carbon footprint profiles and insights based on customers' spending.\n\n## What we look forward to in 2022\n\nThe acceleration of digital adoption across the world triggered an irreversible shift in how people live, work and play. At the same time, with the intensifying climate crisis and increasing inequality, we believe technology can play a crucial part in contributing solutions towards the common good. This belief is integrated in our business strategy, exemplified in the decisions we make, and ever mindful of the communities and environment in which we operate. In 2022, we will continue to create and support innovative solutions that yield positive impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FOCUS AREAS 2   22\n\n- \u00b7 Build on 'phygital' agenda by doubling down on AI/ ML capabilities, and boosting synergies between physical footprint and digital services\n- \u00b7 Continue to grow wealth business by capturing GBA opportunities, championing ESG, and providing world-class digital capabilities\n- \u00b7 Scale up ecosystem partnerships to provide intelligent, intuitive and invisible services",

They include children, young adults, families, seniors and the community at large. By widening our reach in the community through various initiatives, we remain committed to bringing value to our customers in Singapore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POSB Smart Buddy Programme\n\nWe continued to expand the world's first integrated in-school savings and payments programme to more schools. The POSB Smart Buddy programme, which was launched in 2017, creates a contactless payments ecosystem within the school environment to help cultivate sensible savings and spending habits among young students in an interactive, engaging manner.\n\nIn 2021, some 40,000 students across 80 schools have adopted Smart Buddy smartwatches and cards for digital payments. Students and their parents are able to track spending and savings patterns via the Smart Buddy mobile app in real-time. 36 schools are utilising Smart Buddy to disburse government subsidies to more than 3,500 students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPOSB remains the only bank to work with the Migrant Workers' Centre and Centre for Domestic Employees to set up banking accounts for more than 640,000 migrant workers and foreign domestic workers. Some 67% of them use the POSB digibank app to conduct their banking transactions today. In 2021, remittance volumes for work permit holder accounts grew, with the number of remittances increasing by 23% year-on-year.\n\nWe also piloted the use of data analytics and robotics in one of our POSB 24/7 self-service branches to better serve our customers. For instance, Temi robot has been deployed in the branch to help remind customers to adhere to safe management measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## POSB PAssion Run for Kids\n\nWe organised our first-ever hybrid POSB PAssion Run for Kids incorporating onsite activities and a virtual race in 2021, bringing Singapore's largest charity kids run event into its 13 th year.\n\nMore than 2,400 participants took part and raised over SGD 800,000 for the POSB PAssion Kids Fund.\n\nTo date, SGD10.8 million has been raised, with more than 700,000 children benefitting from 182 programmes.

During the annual Board strategy offsite (which was held over a three day period in Singapore at the end of September 2021), the Board actively deliberated on:\n\n- \u00b7 how DBS' technology capabilities compared to those of big technology companies (such as Google, Amazon, Netflix, Revolut, Ant Group);\n- \u00b7 the progress of new business initiatives which use DBS' technology capabilities (including DBS Digital Exchange, Partior, Climate Impact X and DBS Fixed Income Execution (FIX) Marketplace) and how we can create value from these initiatives;\n- \u00b7 the new/ incremental risks to DBS which could arise from the commercialisation of its technology strengths;\n- \u00b7 using technology to entrench DBS' digital bank leadership in Singapore amidst the increasingly competitive landscape (with competition from digital banks and fintechs); and\n- \u00b7 doubling down on DBS' Asia strategy, with particular focus on how we can accelerate our growth in China (following the acquisition of a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank (SZRCB)), India (following the acquisition of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB)), and Indonesia.\n\n## Focus on Technology Risks\n\nThe Board had an in-depth discussion on the two-day digital disruption in digital banking services (which occurred in November 2021), including the events which led to the disruption, the actions which were taken to resolve the issues, remedial actions as well as communications to our customers. In addition, both the Audit Committee (AC) and Board Risk Management Committee (BRMC) were kept updated on cybersecurity issues, including the results of the cyber red team simulation conducted in 2021 to assess DBS' cyber security posture across all jurisdictions (with particular focus on remote working scenarios, insider threat scenarios and IT systems hosted in the cloud), and the areas where follow-up actions were required.\n\n## Focus on Sustainability\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues were a significant focus area for the Board during 2021. The Board was given a presentation by an external expert on Vision 2050, which was launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (a global CEO-led organisation of over 200 leading businesses (including DBS) working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world). Vision 2050 sets out various transformational pathways which industries could take to achieve the vision of having around 9 billion people living well and within the limits of the planet by 2050.\n\nThe Board discussed the actions being taken by business/ support units pursuant to the three pillars of the DBS Sustainability Framework (i.e. Responsible Banking; Responsible Business Practices; Impact Beyond Banking). It also discussed DBS' decision to commit to net zero by 2050 by being the first Singapore bank to join the United Nationsconvened Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in 2021, and the proposed glidepaths to enable DBS to achieve certain targets by 2030.\n\n## Establishment of Board Sustainability Committee\n\nIn view of the heightened expectations among external stakeholders on DBS' sustainability agenda and commitments, as well as the increased requirements in the areas of governance, target setting, tracking and disclosures following DBS' public commitment to join the NZBA, the Board approved the establishment of a Board Sustainability Committee (BSC) in February 2022 to provide better focus on sustainability matters. The Chairperson of the BSC is Mr Piyush Gupta, and the members of the BSC are Mr Tham Sai Choy, Ms Judy Lee and Mr Chng Kai Fong. Fees payable to the members of the BSC (who are non-executive Directors) will be similar to the fees payable to members of the Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC), and will be subject to shareholders' approval at our annual general meeting (AGM) to be held in 2023.\n\n## Pursuing inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives\n\nThe Board reviewed and deliberated on several inorganic acquisitions and new business initiatives, including the (i) acquisition of a 13% stake in SZRCB; (ii) acquisition of Citigroup's consumer banking business in Taiwan; and (iii) establishment of a USD 500 million growth debt financing platform with Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited for Asia's growth stage technology-enabled companies. In addition, following the merger of LVB with DBS Bank India Limited (DBIL) at the end of November 2020, the Board closely monitored the progress of the integration of LVB's business with DBIL in the course of 2021.\n\nThe BRMC also deliberated on the risks arising from new business initiatives (including the DBS Digital Exchange and the DBS digital ecosystem) and ensured that appropriate risk management and governance policies and procedures were put in place to manage these risks.\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nBoard renewal is a key focus for us. In 2021, the Nominating Committee (NC) continued the search for potential candidates who could be lined up for appointment as Directors of DBS Group Holdings Ltd (DBSH) and DBS Bank Ltd (DBS Bank). New Directors will be introduced gradually so that the Board and Board committees have a smooth transition period.\n\nAs part of the Board renewal process in 2021,",

        "page_content": "three long-serving Directors (Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Andre Sekulic and Mrs Ow Foong Pheng) stepped down on 30 March 2021 after having served on the Board for nine years or more, while two new Directors (Mr Chng Kai Fong and Ms Judy Lee) were appointed.\n\nThe NC had appointed a global search firm to identify and recommend candidates for appointment as Directors. The NC considered various candidates recommended by the global search firms as well as candidates recommended by other Board members. Diversity was one of the key considerations in the board renewal process to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS. Other key considerations included (i) whether the skillsets of the candidates would replace\n\nskillsets of long-serving Directors, and/or would supplement the collective skillsets of the Directors and bring different perspectives to the Board; (ii) whether the candidate would fit in with our Board's culture and diversity; (iii) the independence status of the candidate; and (iv) whether the candidate would be able to commit sufficient time to fulfil the duties of a Director. A skills matrix is used to assess if the skills and experience of a candidate complement those of the existing Board members. Potential candidates are informed of the level of contribution and commitment expected of a DBS Director.\n\n## Two new Directors appointed in 2021\n\nMr Chng Kai Fong was appointed as a NonExecutive and Non-Independent Director of\n\neach of DBSH and DBS Bank with effect from 31 March 2021, and serves on the AC, NC and the recently established BSC. As Mrs Ow Foong Pheng was due to step down as a Director at the 2021 AGM on 30 March 2021, the Board approved the appointment of Mr Chng, who is a senior Singapore civil servant, as a new non-executive Director to provide the Board with insights and perspectives from the public sector, as well as government connectivity. Mr Chng is currently the Second Permanent Secretary of The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG), Prime Minister's Office. Prior to joining SNDGG, he was the Managing Director of Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) from 2017 to 2021. Before he joined EDB, he was the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister of Singapore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMs Judy Lee, an American citizen, was appointed as an Independent Director of each of DBSH and DBS Bank with effect from 4 August 2021, and serves on the AC, BRMC, CMDC and the recently established BSC. She was one of the candidates recommended by the global search firm. Ms Lee has over 30 years of experience as a banker, risk management expert and advisor to CEOs; within banking, she has worked in trading, capital markets and derivatives. In addition, in quantitative risk management, she has been a pioneer, practitioner and advisor across all risk types and industries. Ms Lee is currently the Managing Director of Dragonfly LLC, an international risk advisory firm based in New York. Concurrently, she is CEO of Dragonfly Capital Ventures LLC, which develops and invests in renewable energy in Southeast Asia.\n\n## Change of Group Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Board was actively involved in the change of the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) in 2021. After Mr Tan Teck Long (the previous CRO) tendered his resignation in September 2021, an ad-hoc Board meeting was quickly convened to discuss the reasons for Mr Tan's\n\nresignation, the candidate for appointment as the new CRO as well as the plans to manage the CRO transition. The Board noted that Mr Tan wanted to return to a customer facing role, and expressed its appreciation to Mr Tan, who started his career in DBS as a trainee officer in 1993, for his extensive contributions to DBS over the past 28 years.\n\nThe Board reviewed and approved the appointment of Mr Soh Kian Tiong as the new CRO. As part of the succession planning for members of the Group Management Committee (GMC), Mr Soh was being groomed to be one of the successors for the CRO role. Mr Soh is a career DBS banker with over 25 years of experience in business and risk roles in Singapore, Hong Kong and Mainland China.\n\n## Competent leadership\n\n## Our board\n\nThe Board directs DBS in the conduct of its affairs and provides sound leadership to management. We have 10 Board members (including two female directors) with a broad\n\nrange of experience and deep industry expertise. The make-up of our Board reflects diversity of gender, nationality, age, skills and knowledge. Independent Directors form the majority of the Board, and there are no alternate Directors on our Board.\n\nOur Chairman, Mr Peter Seah, sits on all Board committees (other than the recently established Board Sustainability Committee) and he also chairs the Board Executive Committee (EXCO). Mr Seah performs a key role as an ambassador for DBS in our dealings with various stakeholders as well as in ensuring effective communication with our shareholders. He guides the Board through its decision-making process and ensures that the Board operates effectively as a team.\n\nThere is a very positive and constructive working relationship between our Chairman and CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta. Mr Gupta oversees the execution of DBS' strategy and is responsible for managing the day-to-day operations. Other than the CEO, none of the other Directors is a former or current employee of DBSH or its subsidiaries.",

There are five scheduled Board meetings each year. Ad-hoc meetings are also held when necessary. There were two ad-hoc Board meetings held in 2021. Please refer to the Board highlights - 2021 section on pages 44 to 45 for more information on the key focus areas of the Board in 2021.",

        "page_content": "Before each Board meeting, the Chairman oversees the setting of the agenda of Board meetings, in consultation with the CEO, to ensure that there is sufficient information and time to address all agenda items. The agenda also allows for flexibility when needed. Directors are provided with complete information related to agenda items in a timely manner. All materials for Board and Board committee meetings are uploaded onto a secure portal which can be accessed on tablet devices provided to the Directors.\n\nDuring every quarterly Board meeting:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairperson of each Board committee provides an update on significant matters discussed at the Board committee meetings which are typically scheduled before the quarterly Board meeting;\n- \u00b7 the CFO presents the financial performance for that quarter and significant financial highlights;\n- \u00b7 the CEO gives an update on certain aspects of the Group's business and operations and/ or a macro perspective on industry trends and developments;\n- \u00b7 the Board holds a private session for Directors; and\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director holds a private session with the other independent Directors.\n\nIn 2021, the CEO updated the Board on (i) how DBS is building a sustainable franchise using the three pillars of DBS' sustainability framework; (ii) the Singapore consumer business, including how we are using data and digital tools to drive customer segmentation to shape the DBS brand and deliver on our brand promise; (iii) our progress in managing through customer journeys and creating horizonal organisations; (iv) the SME digital strategy; (v) various new business initiatives; and (vi) updates on the progress of the integration of the business of LVB with DBIL.\n\nIn addition to the quarterly Board meetings, a Board meeting is typically scheduled in December each year where the CEO gives the Board an update on DBS' performance against the balanced scorecard for that financial year. In addition, the CEO and CFO will present the Group's budget for the next financial year to the Board for approval.\n\nThe Chairman promotes open and frank debates by all Directors at every Board meeting. If there is a conflict of interest, the Director in question will recuse himself or herself from the discussions and abstain from participating in any Board decision. When exigencies prevent a Director from attending a Board or Board committee meeting in person, that Director can participate by telephone or video-conference.\n\nDirectors have the discretion to engage external advisers. External professionals or in-house subject matter experts may also be\n\n|\n\n## Matters discussed by the Board and Board Committees in 2021\n\nNote: Further details of the activities of the Board and Board committees in 2021 can be found on pages 44 to 45 and 47 to 56.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninvited to present key topics to the Board as well as updates on corporate governance, risk management, capital, tax, accounting, listing and other regulations, which may have an impact on DBS' affairs.\n\nDirectors have independent access to the Group Secretary. The Group Secretary attends all Board meetings and minutes are prepared to record key deliberations and decisions taken during the meetings. The Group Secretary facilitates communication between the Board, its committees and management, and generally assists Directors in the discharge of their duties. The Group Secretary helps with the induction of new Directors. The appointment and removal of the Group Secretary require the approval of the Board.\n\n## Frequent and effective engagement\n\nDirectors have ongoing interactions across various levels, functions and countries within DBS. In addition, some Directors also sit on the boards of our overseas subsidiaries; this arrangement gives the Board access to first-hand insight on the activities of these subsidiaries. The CFO provides the Board with detailed financial performance reports monthly.\n\nDirectors also have various opportunities to interact with members of the Group\n\nManagement Committee (GMC) (for instance, at quarterly Board-hosted dinners and during the annual board strategy offsite). Due to Covid-19, many of these interactions in 2021 were conducted virtually.\n\n## Annual Board strategy offsite\n\nEach year, the Board and our senior executives attend a strategy offsite held in one of our markets, which allows them to:\n\n- \u00b7 focus on DBS' long-term strategy apart from the regular agenda at the quarterly Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 engage in dynamic and in-depth strategic discussions to promote deeper understanding of our business environment and our operations, and refine our strategy; and\n- \u00b7 engage with our stakeholders in the host country (such as regulators, media, customers including CEOs and CFOs of our corporate clients and staff in the local franchise).\n\nThe 2021 Board strategy offsite was held over a three-day period in Singapore at the end of September 2021. Please refer to the Board highlights - 2021 section on pages 44 to 45 for more information on the discussions during the 2021 Board strategy offsite.",

The terms of reference of each Board committee set out the responsibilities of the Board committee, conduct of meetings including quorum, voting requirements and qualifications for Board committee membership. All our Board committees (other than the recently established BSC) comprise non-executive Directors only. Any change to the terms of\n\nreference for any Board committee requires Board approval. The minutes of Board committee meetings, which records the key deliberations and decisions taken during these meetings, are circulated to all Board members for their information.\n\n## Nominating Committee (NC)\n\n## Key responsibilities of the NC\n\n- \u00b7 Regularly reviews the composition of the Board and Board committees, and independence of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Identifies, reviews and recommends Board appointments for approval by the Board,\n\ntaking into account the industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional qualifications, age and gender of the candidate and the needs of the Board;\n\n- \u00b7 Conducts an annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, the Board committees and the Directors;\n- \u00b7 Implements the Board Diversity Policy and reviews its effectiveness;\n- \u00b7 Exercises oversight of the induction programme and continuous development programme for Directors, and ensures that first-time directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo relevant training;",

Thereafter, the NC conducts an assessment to:\n\n- \u00b7 review the candidate (including qualifications, attributes, capabilities, skills, age, past experience) to determine whether the candidate is fit and proper in accordance with the fit and proper guidelines issued by the MAS; and\n- \u00b7 ascertain whether the candidate is independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder and/or from management and business relationships with DBS.\n\nThe NC then interviews the short-listed candidates and makes its recommendations to the Board. All Board appointments are based on merit, taking into account the contributions the candidates can bring to the Board to enhance its effectiveness. Upon the appointment of a new Director, the NC will recommend to the Board his or her appointment to the appropriate Board committee(s) after matching the Director's skillset to the needs of each Board committee.\n\n## Induction and Training for new Directors\n\nThe NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our induction programme, which covers the duties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director's pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered by the induction programme. We have briefing sessions for Directors given by members of senior management on the various businesses of DBS and its supporting functions. The NC is also responsible for ensuring that new Directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company.\n\nIn 2021, the two new Directors (Mr Chng Kai Fong and Ms Judy Lee) attended our 4-day induction programme after they were appointed as Directors. As part of the induction\n\n|\n\nprogramme, they had one-on-one meetings with members of the GMC. In addition, as DBS is the first listed company directorship for both Mr Chng and Ms Lee, they attended training sessions conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) on the roles and responsibilities of a listed company director.\n\n## Annual review of Directors' independence\n\nThe NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of financial institutions prescribed under the Banking CG Regulations. Under the Banking CG Regulations, an 'independent director' is defined to mean a Director who is:\n\n- \u00b7 independent from any management and business relationship with DBS;\n- \u00b7 independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and\n- \u00b7 has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.\n\nThe NC assessed and concluded that (i) all Directors are considered to be independent from business relationships with DBS; (ii) with the exception of Mr Piyush Gupta, all Directors are considered to be independent from management relationships with DBS; (iii) with the exception of Mr Chng Kai Fong, all Directors are considered to be independent from DBSH's substantial shareholder, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek). Mr Chng, who is the Second Permanent Secretary for The Smart Nation and Digital Government Group, Prime Minister's Office, Singapore, is considered not independent of Temasek as the Singapore government is its ultimate owner; and (iv) Mr Peter Seah and Mr Ho Tian Yee are NonIndependent directors as they have served on the Board for more than nine years. Based on the NC's assessment, the Independent Directors are Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim and Mr Tham Sai Choy.\n\nAlthough Mr Ho Tian Yee, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Peter Seah and Mr Tham Sai Choy are on the boards of companies that have business relationships with DBS, and are also directors of companies in which Temasek has investments (Temasek portfolio companies), the NC considers these Directors (i) independent of business relationships as the revenues arising from such relationships are not material; and (ii) independent of Temasek as their appointments on the boards of Temasek portfolio companies are non-executive in nature and they are not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the businesses of the Temasek portfolio companies. In addition, none of these Directors sit on any of the boards of the Temasek portfolio companies as a representative of Temasek and they do not take instructions from Temasek in acting as Directors.\n\n## Board performance and evaluation\n\nThe NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing effectively and identifies steps for improvement. The NC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board's performance once every three to four years, and to gain insights on the Board's performance against peer boards and best practices. An external evaluator was last engaged to conduct the Board performance evaluation for the financial year ended 2018.\n\nIn 2021, the NC engaged Aon Hewitt (Aon), an independent external evaluator, to conduct the Board evaluation for FY2021. Aon is not connected with DBS or any of the Directors. As part of the evaluation process, a Board evaluation questionnaire (which included questions on Board composition, Board information, Board processes/culture, Board accountability, Capital/risk, Management, Standards of Conduct, Board relationships and effectiveness of Board committees) was circulated to each Director and the completed questionnaires were returned to Aon. Thereafter, Aon conducted one-on-one interviews with each Director to get more in-depth feedback and perspectives on the performance of the Board. The NC and the Board then discussed the results of the Board evaluation, which reflected that the Board is above the market 90 th percentile for all categories evaluated (based on other board evaluation surveys conducted by Aon).\n\nIn addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains qualified for office. In making its determination, the NC will take into account (i) the Director's age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; (ii) whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and (iii) whether each Director has committed sufficient time to his/ her duties as a director of DBS. The Board is satisfied that each Director has diligently discharged his or her duties as a Director of DBS and has contributed meaningfully to DBS.\n\n## Directors' time commitment\n\nThe meeting attendance records of all Directors as well as a list of their directorships of listed companies and their principal commitments are fully disclosed in our Annual Report. The NC assesses each Director's ability to commit time to DBS' affairs in accordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/ she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete an annual selfassessment of his/ her time commitments.",

        "page_content": "While the Board has not set a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director may hold, all Directors appreciate the high level of commitment required of a Director. All Directors have met the requirements under the NC's guidelines.\n\n## Directors' tenure\n\nThe NC members believe that it is in the interests of DBS for the Board to be comprised of Directors with longer tenures who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as Directors with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives. There are currently three Directors who have served for more than ten years, and this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where six long-serving Directors have stepped down and seven new Directors have been appointed since November 2017.\n\nThe NC specifically considered the skillsets and contributions of the three long-serving Directors (being Mr Peter Seah, Mr Ho Tian Yee and Mr Piyush Gupta). The NC deliberated and agreed that it is in DBS' interests for these Directors to continue serving on the Board of DBS for the following reasons:\n\n- i) it is important that Mr Peter Seah remains as the Board Chairman to provide leadership and continuity. Mr Seah is a veteran former banker with wide industry experience, and he has been instrumental in the growth and transformation of DBS over the past 12 years. From a strategic perspective, the next few years are critical as DBS continues to execute on its digital transformation and growth strategies (especially with the prevailing macroeconomic and geo-political headwinds as well as challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic) and enhance its franchise in the Greater Bay Area, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;\n- ii) it is in the interests of DBS for Mr Ho Tian Yee to continue serving on the Board for another year. Mr Ho is a seasoned banker with market risk/trading expertise gained from over 30 years of experience in managing and investing in global financial markets. Having served on the Board Risk Management Committee since he was appointed as a Director in April 2011, he has an in-depth understanding of DBS' risk environment and provides valuable insights and perspectives to help DBS navigate the complex and challenging risk landscape; and\n- iii)   as CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta should remain as a Director to provide the Board with insights into the business.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nUnder the Constitution of DBSH, one-third of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from office and, if eligible, stand for re-election at\n\neach AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH's Constitution to stand for re-election at the first AGM after their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and reelection of Directors at the AGM.\n\nPrior to each AGM, Group Secretariat informs the NC which Directors are required to retire at that AGM. The NC will then review the composition of the Board and decide whether to recommend to the Board the re-election of these Directors, after taking into account factors such as their attendance, participation, contribution, expertise and competing time commitments.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, Dr Bonghan Cho, Mr Olivier Lim and Mr Tham Sai Choy will be retiring by rotation, while Mr Chng Kai Fong and Ms Judy Lee are required to stand for re-election as this is the first AGM after their appointment. At the recommendation of the NC and as approved by the Board, all five Directors will be standing for re-election at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Review of composition of Board Committees\n\nThe NC regularly reviewed the size and composition of the Board committees in 2021 to ensure that all independence requirements continue to be met, and that the Board committees are of an appropriate size and comprise the appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience, as well as diversity of nationality, age and gender.\n\nThe following changes were made to the composition of the Board committees in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Following the retirement of Ms Euleen Goh from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM, Mr Olivier Lim took over from Ms Goh as the BRMC chairman with effect from 31 March 2021.\n- \u00b7 Following the retirement of Mr Andre Sekulic from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM, Mr Anthony Lim took over from Mr Sekulic as the CMDC chairman with effect from 31 March 2021.\n- \u00b7 Ms Punita Lal was appointed as a member of the AC with effect from 31 March 2021.\n- \u00b7 Mr Chng Kai Fong was appointed as a member of the AC and the NC with effect from 31 March 2021.\n- \u00b7 Ms Judy Lee was appointed as a member of the AC, the BRMC and the CMDC with effect from 4 August 2021.\n\n## Continuous development programme for all Directors\n\nThe NC monitors the frequency and quality of the Board training sessions, which are conducted either by external professionals or by management. The NC selects topics which\n\nare relevant to the Group's activities. Board members also contribute by highlighting areas of interests and possible topics.\n\nThe topics presented to the Board in 2021 as part of the continuous development programme included: (i) emerging technologies, including blockchain and distributed ledger, and the implications on DBS; (ii) insights from various external experts on (a) 'Vision 2050: Time to Transform' launched by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, (b) growth and value creation in fintechs, as well as (c) outlook and implications of recent policy actions in China; (iii) training session on various Accounting and Disclosure matters (including capital and liquidity regulations, expected credit loss and valuations); (iv) risk training session on DBS' Risk-Based Limit approach; and (v) updates on Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) reform and implications on DBS.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nWe recognise that diversity is not merely limited to gender or any other personal attributes. We adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises the importance of having an effective and diverse Board, and states that the NC is responsible for setting the relevant objectives that promote and achieve diversity on the Board. In discharging its duties, the NC shall give due regard to the benefits of all aspects of diversity and strive to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS.\n\nThe main objective of the Board Diversity Policy is to continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long-term success of DBS. The Board Diversity Policy provides that the NC shall endeavour to ensure that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying candidates to be appointed as new directors, with the aim of having not less than two female directors on the Board. Two out of ten directors on the Board (20% of the Board) are female.\n\nThe NC is responsible for developing a framework to identify the skills that the Board collectively needs in order to discharge the Board's responsibilities effectively, taking into account the complexity of DBS' existing risk profile, business operations and future business strategy. The NC has put in place a skills matrix which classifies skills, experience and knowledge of Directors into the following broad categories (i) Industry knowledge and experience; (ii) Financial and commercial acumen; (iii) Governance; (iv) Leadership; (v) Digital Transformation; and (vi) Sustainability.\n\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional qualifications, age and gender on the Board, and is satisfied that the objectives of the Board Diversity Policy continue to be met.",

The  AC noted that major weak credits are reviewed by the Board Executive Committee quarterly and presented to the AC.  The AC was apprised of the external auditor's work over credit, which included sampling across performing, watch-list  and non-performing portfolios to assess the appropriateness of the loan ratings and classification, the adequacy of  specific allowances where applicable, and an evaluation of how the impact from Covid-19 had been taken into account.

The AC noted that ECL  models are validated by the Model Validation Team, which also monitors the models' performance, and approved by  the Group Credit Risk Models Committee. The AC took into account the external auditor's observations, which included  a review of selected portfolios by credit specialists, along with assessments of the Group's methodologies (including  the reasonableness of certain forward-looking economic inputs), processes and controls.

The AC was apprised of the external auditor's observations from its assessment of the Group's controls  over the valuation process, as well as its conclusion, based on the result of its independent estimates, that the valuation  of financial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes. The AC considers the valuation  process, policies and estimates as adopted and disclosed in the financial statements to be appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

The CMDC provides oversight of the remuneration principles of the CEO, senior executives and control functions to ensure that they are in line with the Financial Stability Board's guidelines. As part of the review of the annual variable pay pool as well as the remuneration of the CEO and senior executives, the CMDC appraises how well DBS has performed against the balanced scorecard for each year.\n\nWe have a robust disciplinary framework linked to individual compensation. The CMDC was apprised of the impact of disciplinary actions on individuals' compensation when approving the annual variable compensation pool and\n\nNon-executive Directors' fee structure for FY2021 (unchanged from FY2020)\n\n| Basic annual retainer fees                                                                        | SGD       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Board                                                                                             | 100,000   |\n| Lead Independent Director                                                                         | 75,000    |\n| Additional Chairman fees for:                                                                     |           |\n| Board                                                                                             | 1,450,000 |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                   | 90,000    |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                   | 90,000    |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                 | 65,000    |\n| Executive Committee                                                                               | 75,000    |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                              | 45,000    |\n| Additional committee member fees for:  (Note: Board committee chairpersons do not get these fees) |           |\n| Audit Committee                                                                                   | 60,000    |\n| Board Risk Management Committee                                                                   | 60,000    |\n| Compensation and Management Development Committee                                                 | 35,000    |\n| Executive Committee                                                                               | 60,000    |\n| Nominating Committee                                                                              | 30,000    |\n\nnoted that (i) the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective, and (ii) the 2021 Risk & Culture score from the Kincentric My Voice survey increased to 91%.\n\nDuring the year, the CMDC reviews market trends to ensure that the Group's remuneration remains competitive in the context of our performance and productivity.\n\n## Talent Review and Succession Planning\n\nThe CMDC reviews the state of the talent and the strength of the human capital in DBS in support of its overall strategy. This includes a review of the talent bench strength, 'team in the field', succession plans for CEO and GMC members, as well as development plans for our High Potentials (HIPOs).\n\nSuccession Planning is a rigorous process in DBS which includes inputs from the respective country and Group Functional Heads, followed by detailed reviews with the CEO. The CMDC reviewed the succession plans of CEO and the GMC members based on a DBS proprietary 'Key Success Factors' framework, which comprises four dimensions of a DBS senior leader success profile viz (i) domain knowledge, (ii) critical experiences, (iii) leadership competencies and (iv) leadership traits. Potential successors for GMC were evaluated against these four dimensions to assess their readiness, and development plans to address their leadership gaps were put in place to prepare them for succession.\n\nIn assessing its Talent bench strength, DBS\n\nfollows a robust HIPO identification process based on the '3P framework' namely Performance, PRIDE! and Potential. The assessment of potential is based on one's ability, aspiration and engagement.  Identified HIPOs are developed through a comprehensive 'triple-E development framework' which focuses on actionable development activities around education (conferences and leadership programs), exposure (mentoring, coaching and networking) and experience (new or stretched roles, cross country and cross function assignments), designed to accelerate their growth.\n\nThe commitment to HIPO development has paid off. In 2021, HIPO attrition was healthy at 6.2%, well within our target of below 10%. 49% of our HIPOs also took on enhanced or changed roles, well above our target of 30%.\n\n## Staff Welfare\n\nThe CMDC was also apprised of how we worked together effectively in the remote working environment. We have supported our colleagues, prioritising their wellbeing, safety and security, and have also accelerated the implementation of wellbeing initiatives, including the 'Together' movement (which was implemented in 2020) where various programs are held (such as engagement programs, hangouts, seminars and training festivals) to galvanise staff together.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of Non-Executive Directors\n\nPlease refer to pages 46 to 47 for details of remuneration of each non-executive Director (including the Chairman) for FY2021.\n\nThe CMDC reviews and recommends a framework to the Board for determining the remuneration of all non-executive Directors. The remuneration of non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, has been benchmarked against global and local financial institutions. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, non-executive Directors receive 70% of their fees in cash and the remaining 30% in share awards.\n\nThe share awards are not subject to a vesting period, but are subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director is required to hold the equivalent of one year's basic retainer fees for his or her tenure as a Director and for one year after the date he or she steps down. The fair value of share grants to the non-executive Directors are based on the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares of DBSH over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the AGM. The actual number of ordinary shares to be awarded are rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance is paid in cash. Other than these share awards, the non-executive Directors do not receive any other share incentives or securities under the DBSH Share Plan.\n\nThe table on page 55 sets out the annual fee structure for the non-executive Directors for FY2021. There is no change to the annual fee structure from FY2020. Non-executive Directors are also paid attendance fees for attending Board and Board committee meetings. Shareholders are entitled to vote on the remuneration of non-executive Directors at the 2022 AGM.\n\nAlthough the non-executive Directors' fee structure for FY2021 remains unchanged from the previous year, the amount of nonexecutive Directors' remuneration for FY2021 is approximately 4% higher than that for FY2020. The higher remuneration for FY2021 is mainly attributable to the following reasons: (i) each of the non-executive Directors (who was in office during the last Annual General Meeting) received a basic retainer fee of SGD 90,000 for FY2020 (instead of SGD 100,000) as they\n\nhad volunteered to take a 10% reduction in their basic retainer fees of SGD 100,000 for FY2020, in a show of solidarity with the nation and our stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, the Board Chairman received a lower Board Chairman's fee of SGD 1,305,000 (instead of SGD 1,450,000) as he had also volunteered to take a 10% reduction in his Board Chairman's fees for FY2020 (in addition to the 10% reduction in his basic retainer fee); and (ii) higher attendance fees due to the increased number of Board and Board committee meetings held in FY2021 and increase in-person attendance at such meetings. As DBS had navigated the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic well in 2021, there will be no reduction in non-executive Directors' remuneration for FY2021.\n\nIn addition, Mr Peter Seah (who is also the Chairman of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited) received director's fees of HKD 1,010,000 for FY2021, and Mr Tham Sai Choy (who sits on the board of DBS Bank (China) Limited) received director's fees of CNY 471,000 in FY2021.\n\nNone of the Group's employees was an immediate family member of a Director with remuneration exceeding SGD 100,000 in 2021.\n\n## Effective controls\n\n## Group Approving Authority\n\nThe Group Approving Authority (GAA) is an integral part of our corporate governance framework.\n\nThe Board's responsibilities are well defined in the GAA. The Board is the decision-making body for matters with significant impact to DBS as a whole; these include matters with strategic, financial or reputational implications or consequences. The specific matters that require board approval under the GAA include:\n\n- \u00b7 Group's annual and interim financial statements;\n- \u00b7 investments and divestments exceeding certain material limits;\n- \u00b7 Group's annual budget;\n- \u00b7 capital expenditures and expenses exceeding certain material limits;\n- \u00b7 capital-related matters including capital adequacy objectives, capital structure, capital issuance and redemption;\n- \u00b7 dividend policy; and\n- \u00b7 risk strategy and risk appetite statement.\n\n## Scope of delegation of authority in the GAA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe GAA ensures that appropriate controls and decision-making are consistently applied throughout DBS. Under the GAA, the Board has delegated to the CEO the responsibility to ensure that the Group's businesses and operations are operated in accordance with Board-approved strategies and standards, which include responsibilities for the internal control framework within DBS. On matters where authority has been delegated to him, the CEO may further delegate his responsibilities and authorities to any GMC member or members and may empower them to, in turn, delegate their responsibilities and authorities to other executives and committees of the Group.\n\nThe GAA covers internal authority only and does not override any specific provisions arising from statutory, regulatory, exchange listing requirements, or the DBSH's Constitution. The GAA is regularly reviewed and updated to accommodate changes in the scope and activities of DBS' business and operations. The Board approves the GAA and any change to it.\n\n## Internal controls framework\n\nOur internal controls framework covers financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, as well as risk management policies and systems. The Board, supported by the AC and BRMC, oversees the Group's system of internal controls and risk management. DBS has three lines of defence when it comes to risk taking, where each line of defence has a clear responsibility.\n\n| Board, CEO and Senior   | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence            | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence               | Provides oversight of the three lines of defence   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Management              | First line of defence                                       | Second line of defence                                         | Third line of defence                              |\n| Role                    | Own and manage risks in  respective areas of responsibility | Provide independent risk  oversight, monitoring and  reporting | Provide independent assurance                      |\n| Unit                    | Business and support units                                  | Risk Management, Legal and  Compliance                         | Internal Audit                                     |\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## First line of defence\n\nOur business and support units are our first line of defence. Their responsibilities include the identification and management of risks arising from and relating to their respective areas of responsibilities, and ensuring that our operations remain within approved boundaries of our risk appetite and policies.\n\nDBS has an established incident notification protocol that sets out processes for the escalation of incidents according to the level of severity. In this way, appropriate levels of management are made aware of such incidents and can take action accordingly. There are also well-defined procedures for the escalation, investigation and follow up of any reported wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\n## Second line of defence\n\nRisk Management Group, Group Legal and Compliance and parts of Group Technology & Operations and Group Finance form the second line of defence. They are responsible for the development and maintenance of risk management policies and processes and they provide objective review and challenge on the activities undertaken by business and support units.\n\n## Third line of defence\n\nGroup Audit forms the third line of defence. It provides an independent assessment and assurance on the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of our system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes.\n\n## Group Audit\n\n## Key responsibilities and processes\n\nGroup Audit is independent of the activities it audits. Its objectives, scope of authority and responsibilities are defined in the Audit Charter, which is approved by the AC. Group Audit reports functionally to the Chairperson of the AC and administratively to the CEO.\n\nGroup Audit's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the reliability, adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls, risk management, governance framework and processes;\n- \u00b7 providing an objective and independent assessment of the Group's credit portfolio quality, the execution of approved credit portfolio strategies and control standards relating to credit management processes;\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether DBS complies with laws and regulations and adheres to established policies; and\n- \u00b7 reviewing whether management is taking appropriate steps to address control deficiencies.\n\nGroup Audit adheres to the DBS Code of Conduct and is guided by the Mission Statement in the Audit Charter. It adopted the\n\nCode of Ethics and aligned its practices with the International Professional Practices Framework established by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). In addition, it has embedded IIA's 10 Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing into its activities.\n\nGroup Audit has unfettered access to the AC, the Board and management, as well as the right to seek information and explanation. Group Audit has an organisational and strategic alignment to the Group. The Head of Group Audit has a seat in the GMC and attends all the business reviews and strategic planning forums. The respective heads of audit in each of the five key locations outside Singapore are part of that location's management team.\n\nGroup Audit adopts a risk-based approach in its auditing activities. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control effectiveness of each auditable entity in the Group are assessed. This risk assessment methodology and approach are aligned with that of the Group, including the risk taxonomy.\n\nThe assessment also covers risks arising from new lines of business, new products and emerging risks from DBS' operating environment. Audit projects are planned based on the results of the assessment, with priority given to auditing higher risk areas and as required by regulators.\n\nAudit reports containing identified issues and corrective action plans are reported to the AC and senior management. Progress of the corrective action plans is monitored, and past due action plans are included in regular reports to the senior management and the AC. In all routine audits, Group Audit evaluates the control environment and management's control awareness which incorporates risk culture as guided by the Financial Stability Board's Guidance on Sound Risk Culture.\n\nGroup Audit apprises regulators and external auditors of all relevant audit matters. It works closely with external auditors to coordinate audit efforts.\n\n## Quality assurance and key developments\n\nIn line with leading practices, Group Audit has a quality assurance and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers its audit activity and conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As part of the QAIP, internal quality assurance reviews (QAR) are conducted quarterly and external QAR are carried out at least once every five years by qualified professionals from an external organisation. Since 2019, the internal QAR has been contracted to an independent assessor, Protiviti.\n\nBased on Protiviti's assessment, Group Audit leads the industry in the use of Agile Auditing\n\napproach and application of digital audit tools. These tools incorporate both rule-based and predictive analytics, enabling continuous risk monitoring. In Protiviti's capability maturity model, Group Audit was rated the highest level for audit planning, agile auditing, dynamic risk assessment and data analytics. Group Audit was also recognised by Protiviti for its leading practices and cited in their annual global industry publication - Internal Auditing Around the World.\n\nIn 2021, Group Audit continued to apply the Data Driven Operating Model and Agile practices as part of its audit process. This enabled dynamic risk assessment and enhanced continuous monitoring which improved the speed of risk identification and response. The increased use of Group Audit's analytical tools and data driven approach, coupled with DBS' suite of remote working technologies, helped Group Audit effectively provide audit assurance, in spite of Covid-19 conditions.\n\n## Dealings in securities\n\nAlthough the Group has transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime, the trading updates that are provided for the first and third quarters of each financial year are, for the purpose of the 'black-out' policies prescribed under Rule 1207(19) of the SGX Listing Rules, deemed to constitute 'financial statements'. Accordingly, Directors and employees are prohibited from trading in DBS' securities (i) one month before the release of the full-year financial statements; and (ii) two weeks before the release of its quarterly financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of each financial year.\n\nIn addition, business units and subsidiaries engaging in proprietary trading are restricted from trading in DBS' securities during the black-out period. Group Secretariat informs all Directors and employees of each black-out period ahead of time. Directors and employees are prohibited at all times from trading in DBS' securities if they are in possession of material non-public information.\n\nGMC members are only allowed to trade in DBS' securities within specific window periods (15 market days immediately following the expiry of each black-out period) subject to preclearance. GMC members are also required to obtain pre-approval from the CEO before any sale of DBS' securities. Similarly, the CEO is required to seek pre-approval from the Chairman before any sale of DBS' securities. As part of our commitment to good governance and the principles of share ownership by senior management, the CEO is expected to build up and hold at least the equivalent of three times his annual base salary as shareholding over time.\n\nDBS has put in place a personal investment policy which prohibits employees with access",

Such employees are also required to seek preclearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group's stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in shortterm speculative trading.\n\n## Related Party Transactions\n\nDBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions, including those in the Banking Act, MAS directives and the SGX Listing Rules. The Banking Act and MAS directives impose limits on credit exposures by DBS to certain related entities and persons, while the SGX Listing Rules cover interested person transactions in general.\n\n|\n\nAll new Directors are briefed on relevant provisions that affect them. If necessary, existing credit facilities to related parties are adjusted prior to a Director's appointment, and all credit facilities to related parties are continually monitored. DBS has robust procedures to manage any potential conflict of interest between a Director and DBS. Checks are conducted before DBS enters into credit or other transactions with related parties to ensure compliance with regulations.\n\nThe aggregate contract values of DBS' interested person transactions entered into in 2021 are set out in the above table. These included three joint venture transactions which DBS entered into with its controlling shareholder, Temasek, relating to the establishment of (i) a blockchain-based clearing and settlement platform (Partior); (ii) a global exchange and marketplace for high-quality carbon credits (Climate Impact X); and (iii) a USD 500 million growth debt financing\n\nplatform (EvolutionX). In addition, DBS entered into various interested person transactions with associates of Temasek on arm's length commercial terms and for the purpose of carrying out day-to-day operations (such as leasing of premises, telecommunication/ data services, IT systems and related services, redemption of KrisFlyer miles by DBS/ POSB credit card holders, logistics and security services).\n\n## Material contracts\n\nSince the end of the previous financial year, no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS has been entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, and no such contract subsisted as at 31 December 2021, save as disclosed via SGXNET.\n\n## Assessing the effectiveness of internal controls\n\nDBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the effectiveness of their internal controls. In addition, all units of the Group are required to submit quarterly attestations on their controls relating to the financial reporting process, and annual attestations on their compliance with the overall internal controls framework. Based on the RCSA and the quarterly and annual attestations, the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems provide an annual attestation to the AC relating to the adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' risk management and internal control systems.\n\nGroup Audit performs regular independent reviews to provide assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' internal controls on risk management, control and governance processes. The overall adequacy and effectiveness of DBS' internal controls framework is reviewed by the AC and BRMC.\n\n## Board's commentary on adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls\n\nThe Board has received assurance from the CEO and CFO that, as at 31 December 2021, the Group's financial records have been properly maintained, and the financial statements give a true and fair view of DBS Group's operations and finances.\n\nThe Board has also received assurance from the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems that, as at 31 December 2021, the Group's risk management and internal control systems were adequate and effective to address financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations. The Board noted that: (i) integration efforts on LVB are on track and expected to complete towards the end of 2022, and that",

        "page_content": "at this point in time, there are some gaps between LVB's controls and DBIL's standards, which management is addressing; and (ii) in relation to the two-day digital disruption in November 2021 in Singapore, management has initiated remedial measures to improve the resilience of our services and incident response, with due consideration given to regulatory requirements and expectations.\n\nBased on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by management and various Board committees, as well as assurances received from and mitigation and remedial actions undertaken by management, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC, is of the opinion that the Group's internal controls and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2021 to address financial, operational, compliance risks and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations.\n\nThe Board notes that the internal controls and risk management systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.\n\n## Strong culture\n\n## Effective safeguards\n\nWe believe that effective safeguards against undesired business conduct have to go beyond a 'tick-the-box' mentality. In DBS, other than relying on published codes of conduct, we also advocate the following organisational safeguards to maintain a strong risk and governance culture.\n\n- \u00b7 Tone from the top: The tone set by the Board and senior management is vital; it is equivalent to the moral compass of the organisation. In addition to having in place comprehensive policies, we conduct a robust self-assessment on the Group's risk culture. Please refer to the risk culture section on this page for more information.\n- \u00b7 Aligning strategies and incentives via the balanced scorecard: Please refer to the section on 'Our 2021 priorities' on pages 28 to 33 for more information.\n- \u00b7 Respecting the voice of control functions: We believe that respect for the voice of control functions is a key safeguard. We ensure that control functions are well integrated into our organisational structure so that they can properly discharge their responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 Risk ownership: Please refer to pages 56 to 57 for details on our three lines of defence.\n- \u00b7 Having established escalation protocols: We designed a notification protocol that makes it mandatory for staff to report significant incidents. This means that the organisation is prepared to receive bad news and take necessary remedial actions without shooting the messengers.\n- \u00b7 Encouraging constructive challenges at all levels: Fundamentally, we inculcate a culture that encourages constructive challenges and debate, where all views are evaluated for decision-making. We also operate a culture where we actively engage the Board for their views early.\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing cultural alignment: Finally, we conscientiously reinforce our cultural norms by rewarding right behaviours and censuring wrong ones.\n\n## Risk Culture\n\nRisk Culture is closely intertwined with our corporate values and it encompasses the general awareness, attitudes and behaviour of our employees towards risks. The results of our Risk Culture and Conduct Survey conducted in 2021 indicated a satisfactory risk culture bank-wide.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to monitor our risk culture pulse with a risk culture and conduct dashboard, comprising multi-faceted indicators. Creating awareness continued to be the key focus as we further embedded a strong culture of risk and control across all levels within the organisation. We leveraged digital communication channels to share culturerelated content and conducted training with case studies to aid managers in strengthening the 'Tone from the Middle' and to enhance employee risk sensing and judgement. We continue to place emphasis on conduct as part of our compensation evaluation process.\n\n## The DBS Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct)\n\nThe Code of Conduct sets out the principles and standards of behaviour that are expected of employees of the Group (including part-time and temporary employees) when dealing with customers, business associates, regulators and colleagues. The principles covered in the Code of Conduct include professional integrity, confidentiality, conflicts of interests, fair dealings with customers and whistle-blowing. It also defines the procedures for employees of DBS to report incidents and provides protection for those staff for these disclosures.\n\nAll employees of DBS are required to read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct on an annual basis. Members of the public may access the Code of Conduct on DBS' website, as well as write in via an electronic feedback form on the website. The Code of Conduct encourages employees of DBS to report their\n\nconcerns to DBS' dedicated, independent investigation team within Group Compliance which handles whistle-blowing cases according to a well-defined protocol. Alternatively, in case of actual or potential conflict of interest or fear of retribution, employees of DBS may write in confidence to Human Resources, Group Audit, or even the CEO or the Chairman. In addition, employees of DBS have the option of using the DBS Speak Up service.\n\n## Whistle-blowing policy\n\nDBS Speak Up is a hotline service run by an independent external party that gives employees of the Group the opportunity to speak up on misconduct and/ or wrong-doing by a DBS employee, customer, vendor or third party.\n\nDBS Speak Up service includes:\n\n- \u00b7 a dedicated hotline number, website, email address, fax number and postal address for reporting of suspected incidents of misconduct and wrongdoing;\n- \u00b7 specialist call centre operators with knowledge of individual organisations;\n- \u00b7 expert forensic investigators to analyse reports;\n- \u00b7 timely reporting of incidents to dedicated representatives within an organisation; and\n- \u00b7 recommendations on corrective action.\n\n## Accountability to our shareholders\n\n## Shareholder rights\n\nDBS promotes fair and equitable treatment of all shareholders. All shareholders enjoy specific rights under the Singapore Companies Act and DBSH's Constitution. These rights include, among others, the right to participate in profit distributions and the right to attend and vote at general meetings. Ordinary shareholders are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings in person or by proxy. Indirect investors who hold DBSH shares through a nominee company or custodian bank or through a CPF agent bank ('Relevant Intermediaries') may attend and vote at general meetings by requesting their Relevant Intermediaries to appoint them as proxies.\n\nDBS respects the equal information rights of all shareholders and is committed to the practice of fair, transparent and timely disclosure. All price-sensitive information is publicly released prior to any sessions with individual investors or analysts.\n\nThe Board provides shareholders with regular financial reports, which aim to give shareholders a balanced assessment of the Group's financial performance and position. The Board also ensures timely and full disclosure of material corporate developments to shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with shareholders\n\nOur investor relations activities promote regular, effective and fair communication with shareholders. Separate briefing sessions were conducted for the media and analysts when quarterly results were released. All press statements and quarterly financial statements have been published on our website and the SGX website. A dedicated investor relations team supports the CEO and the CFO in maintaining a close and active dialogue with investors. The DBS website provides contact details for investors to submit their feedback and raise any questions.\n\nDuring the year, we held over 450 meetings with equity investors and over 200 meetings with debt investors. We participated in 37 investor conferences and road shows. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, these engagements were largely conducted through virtual meetings and phone calls. These meetings provide a forum for management to explain DBS' strategy and financial performance, and solicit analysts' and investors' perceptions of DBS.\n\nWe have a disclosure policy to ensure that all disclosures of material information are timely, complete and accurate. The policy sets out how material information should be managed to prevent selective disclosure. Our Group Disclosure Committee (GDC) assists the CEO and the CFO in implementing the disclosure policy. The GDC's objectives are to: (a) periodically review DBS' disclosure policy and update it as needed, (b) ensure that all material disclosures are appropriate, complete and accurate, and (c) ensure selective or inadvertent disclosure of material information is avoided.\n\n## Conduct of shareholder meetings\n\nThis section describes DBS' usual practice for the conduct of general meetings prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020.\n\nDBS encourages and values shareholder participation at its general meetings. The Chairman plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, Board members and management at general meetings. Resolutions requiring shareholders' approval are tabled separately for adoption at general meetings unless they are closely\n\nrelated and are more appropriately tabled together. The minutes of our general meetings may be accessed via our website.\n\nDBS puts all resolutions at general meetings to a vote by electronic poll and announces the results by showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages. DBS appoints an independent external party as scrutineer for the electronic poll voting process. Prior to the commencement of a general meeting, the scrutineer would review the proxies and the electronic poll voting system as part of the proxy verification process. At the general meeting, mobile devices are used for poll voting and the results of the electronic poll voting are announced immediately after each resolution has been put to a vote. DBS maintains an audit trail of all votes cast at the general meeting. The outcome of the general meeting (including detailed results of the poll vote for each resolution) is promptly disclosed on SGXNET within the same day after the conclusion of that meeting.\n\nAnnual General Meetings (AGMs) provide shareholders with the opportunity to share their views and to meet the Board, including the chairpersons of the Board committees and certain members of senior management. Our external auditor is available to answer shareholders' queries. At each AGM, DBS' financial performance for the preceding year is presented to shareholders.\n\n## Conduct of AGM in 2021 amidst current Covid-19 pandemic\n\nDue to prevailing Covid-19 restrictions, shareholders were not able to attend our 2021 AGM in person. Instead, we held our 2021 AGM by electronic means on 30 March 2021 and shareholders were invited to participate at our virtual 2021 AGM by (a) observing and/ or listening to the 2021 AGM proceedings via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream; (b) submitting questions in advance of, or 'live' at, the 2021 AGM; and (c) appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy to vote on their behalf at the 2021 AGM. The Chairman, CEO and our Singapore-resident Directors were present in person at the virtual 2021 AGM proceedings, while the overseas Directors joined the 2021 AGM by way of video\n\n## Where to find key information on each Director?\n\nIn this Annual Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Pages 46 to 47 - Directors' independence status, appointment dates, meeting attendance and remuneration details\n- \u00b7 Pages 191 to 195 - Directors' length of directorship, academic and professional qualifications and present and past directorships\n- \u00b7 Pages 214 to 217 - Additional Information on Directors seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 31 March 2022\n\nAt our website (www.dbs.com): Directors' biodata\n\n|\n\nconference. We have disclosed, on our website and SGXNET, the names of the Directors and senior executives who attended the 2021 AGM held by way of electronic means as well as detailed records of the proceedings including responses to questions raised by shareholders in advance of the 2021 AGM.\n\n## Conduct of 2022 AGM\n\nAs a precautionary measure due to the current Covid-19 situation in Singapore, shareholders will not be able to attend the 2022 AGM in person. Instead, we will be holding our 2022 AGM by electronic means on 31 March 2022 and shareholders are invited to participate at our virtual 2022 AGM by (a) observing and/or listening to the 2022 AGM proceedings via live audio-visual webcast or live audio-only stream; (b) submitting questions in advance of, or 'live' at, the 2022 AGM; and (c) voting at the AGM (i) 'live' by the shareholders themselves or their duly appointed proxy(ies) (other than the Chairman of the Meeting) via electronic means; or (ii) by appointing the Chairman of the Meeting as proxy to vote on their behalf at the AGM. Details of the steps for pre-registration, submission of questions and voting at the 2022 AGM by shareholders, including CPF and SRS investors, are set out in a separate announcement released on SGXNET on 9 March 2022. In view of the constantly evolving Covid-19 situation in Singapore, we may be required to change our arrangements for the AGM at short notice and shareholders should check SGXNET for the latest updates on the status of the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Awards won in 2021\n\nWe received several accolades for our corporate governance:\n\n- \u00b7 At the Singapore Corporate Awards (special edition), we were one of the winners of the Corporate Excellence and Resilience Award\n- \u00b7 We were runner-up in the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) Investors' Choice Awards 2021 for corporate governance in the big-cap companies' category.",

Remuneration policies and practices as set out in the following report are governed by a set of sound principles which are in compliance with various regulatory requirements.\n\n## 1 Objectives of DBS remuneration strategy\n\nDBS' remuneration policy, which is applicable to DBS Bank and all our subsidiaries and overseas offices, seeks to ensure that we are able to attract, motivate and retain employees to deliver long-term shareholder returns, taking into consideration risk management principles and standards set out by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nWhen formulating our remuneration strategy, consideration was given to aligning our remuneration approach with DBS PRIDE!* values in order to drive desired behaviours and achieve the objectives set out in our balanced scorecard.\n\nThe following shows the three main thrusts of our remuneration strategy and how they are implemented within DBS:\n\n| Main thrusts                                                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pay for performance as measured against  balanced scorecard | \u00b7 Instill and drive a pay-for-performance culture  \u00b7 Ensure close linkage between total compensation and our annual and long-term   business objectives as measured by our balanced scorecard  \u00b7 Calibrate mix of fixed and variable pay to drive sustainable performance that   is aligned to DBS PRIDE! values, taking into account both 'what' and 'how' key   performance indicators (KPIs) are achieved |\n| Provide market competitive pay                              | \u00b7 Benchmark our total compensation against other organisations of similar size and   standing in the markets we operate in  \u00b7 Drive performance differentiation by benchmarking total compensation for top  performing employees against the upper quartile or higher in each market                                                                                                                         |\n| Guard against excessive risk-taking                         | \u00b7 Focus on achieving risk-adjusted returns that are consistent with prudent risk and   capital management, as well as emphasise long-term sustainable outcomes  \u00b7 Design payout structure to align incentive payments with the long-term   performance of the Group through deferral and clawback arrangements  \u00b7 Design sales incentive plans to encourage the right sales behaviour                        |\n\n- * Read more on DBS PRIDE! values on page 67.",

It is underpinned by our aim to drive a pay-forperformance culture which is aligned to our risk framework.\n\n| Process                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining total variable pay pool | \u00b7 A function of our overall balanced scorecard and benchmarked against market.

The remuneration of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Group Head of Audit are endorsed by the Chairman of Board Risk Management Committee and Audit Committee respectively and subsequently approved by the Board.\n\nSales employees are incentivised to promote the development of mutually beneficial long-term relationships with their customers, rather than a sole focus on short-term gains. Non-financial metrics such as customer satisfaction and compliance with fair dealing principles are incorporated into their KPIs.\n\n|",

These retention shares are subject to DBS' usual four-year vesting period.\n\nRead more about the Share Plan on page 109.\n\n## 5 Summary of 2021 remuneration outcomes\n\nOur remuneration is linked to how we perform against our balanced scorecard (see pages 28 to 33) which is aligned to long-term value creation for our stakeholders in a sustainable way (see pages 66 to 67). As our scores improved in the current financial year, our variable pay pool was better than the previous year. The Compensation and Management Development committee (CMDC) evaluated and approved the variable pay pool which was subsequently endorsed by the Board.\n\nIn 2020, an external management consulting firm, Oliver Wyman, was engaged to provide an independent review of the Group's compensation system and processes to ensure compliance with the FSB Principles for Sound Compensation Practices. A similar review is planned for 2022.\n\nWe used salary surveys conducted by an external compensation consultant, McLagan, as references for employee salary benchmarking purposes. McLagan and its consultants are independent and not related to us or any of our Directors.\n\n## Senior management and material risk takers\n\nIn line with the principles set out by FSB, a substantial portion of remuneration (more than 50%) for our Senior Management as well as material risk takers (i.e. other employees whose actions have a material impact on the risk exposure of the bank) are variable. The variable remuneration in excess of a certain threshold are subject to deferral, thus ensuring alignment to the time horizon of risks.\n\nOur effective deferral rate for our Senior Management and material risk takers, on an aggregate basis, is usually above 30%. While regulatory guidance has suggested a 40% threshold, we believe that we remain aligned with the regulatory compensation principles as we currently operate with a vesting schedule of four years, which is longer than regulatory guidance of three years. There is also no vesting until two years after the grant date.",

        "page_content": "The following charts show the mix of fixed and variable pay for both groups for performance year 2021:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Senior Management's aggregate total remuneration in 2021 amounted to SGD 79.4 million, including the CEO's remuneration of SGD 13.6 million. Excluding the CEO's remuneration which has been separately disclosed, the median increase in total remuneration of the Senior Management who were members of the Group Management Committee for both 2020 and 2021 was 23.8%. The increase in 2021 relative to 2020 reflects a normalisation following a reduction taken in 2020 in response to the pandemic, and in recognition of the Group's strong performance for FY2021.\n\nWhile corporate governance guidelines recommend that at least the top five key executives' remuneration be disclosed, the Board believes that it would be disadvantageous for us to do so because of the constant battle for talent in a highly competitive industry. This is consistent with banking industry practice in the local market. However, we do provide additional information on the average increase in remuneration of our Senior Management in the year as detailed above.\n\n## Breakdown of deferred remuneration awards\n\n| Category                                                                  | Senior Management  (1)   | Material Risk Takers  (2)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Total outstanding deferred remuneration (3) :                             |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | 0.7%                     | 0.7%                        |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       | 99.3%                    | 99.3%                       |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     | 100.0%                   | 100.0%                      |\n| Outstanding deferred and retained remuneration (3) (4) :                  |                          |                             |\n| Of which exposed to ex-post adjustments                                   |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      |                          | 0.7%                        |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       |                          | 99.3%                       |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               |                          | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     |                          | 100.0%                      |\n| Total amendment during the year due to ex-post explicit adjustments (5) : |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | -                        | -                           |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments                                       | -                        | -                           |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     | -                        | -                           |\n| Total amendment during the year due to ex-post implicit adjustments (5) : |                          |                             |\n| Cash                                                                      | -                        | -                           |\n| Shares and share-linked instruments (6)                                   | 24.6%                    | 27.1%                       |\n| Other forms of remuneration                                               | -                        | -                           |\n| Total                                                                     |                          |                             |\n| Total deferred remuneration paid out in the financial year:               | 31.1%                    | 29.4%                       |\n| Headcount                                                                 | 20                       | 269                         |\n\n- (4) Retained remuneration refers to shares or share-linked instruments that are subject to a retention period under a share retention policy\n- (5) Examples of explicit ex-post adjustments include malus, clawbacks or similar reversal or downward revaluations of awards.

For the year, DBS had record net profit of SGD 6.80 billion, up 44%. Return on equity, at 12.5%, was the second-highest in more than a decade.\n\nThis achievement was all the more remarkable given ongoing challenges in the operating environment. With Covid-19 in the second year, global interest rates remained at rock-bottom levels. China idiosyncratic risks also increased, following moves by the government to temper exuberance in the property market. Against this backdrop, DBS' sterling financial performance underlined the strength of our broad-based franchise and the success of multi-year transformation efforts.\n\nOver the past year, DBS executed several inorganic transactions, including acquiring the consumer banking business of Citigroup in Taiwan and investing in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank. These initiatives will strengthen our franchise, and enable us to ride the crest of a structurally rising Asia. We also launched several new businesses such as DBS Digital Exchange, Partior and Climate Impact X, which harness emerging technologies, and will position us for the future.\n\nGiven our belief that the successful organisation of the future will have to operate very differently, DBS launched new ways of working. This included having some of our people working horizontally across functions to better serve customers and being more data-driven. Recognising that our employees want greater flexibility, we also introduced hybrid work models and flexi-work arrangements. Employee engagement scores improved to 86%, outperforming the Kincentric benchmark for the APAC Financial Services Industry.\n\nDuring the year, DBS also continued to advance the sustainability agenda, both in terms of tackling climate change and addressing the growing social issues in our midst.\n\nThe bank's efforts were well-recognised, with not one but two global publications naming DBS as best in the world.\n\nIn recognition of Mr Gupta's 2021 performance, his present-year remuneration is as outlined below:\n\n## Breakdown of remuneration for performance year 2021 (1 January - 31 December)\n\n|                 | Salary  remuneration   SGD   | Cash bonus SGD   | Share Plan (2) SGD   | Others (3) SGD   | Total (4) SGD   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------|\n| Mr Piyush Gupta | 1,200,000                    | 5,165,000        | 7,135,000            | 75,462           | 13,575,462      |",

The chart below provides an overview of the risks arising from our business segments. The asset size of each business segment reflects its contribution to the balance sheet, and the risk-weighted assets (RWA) offer a risk-adjusted perspective.\n\nRefer to Note 45 to the financial statements on page 181 for more information about DBS' business segments\n\n| SGD million           | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management   | Institutional  Banking   | Treasury Markets   | Others (a)   | Group   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Assets (b)            | 127,268                                 | 313,180                  | 163,554            | 76,709       | 680,711 |\n| Risk-weighted  assets | 50,252                                  | 220,012                  | 44,532             | 27,895       | 342,691 |\n| % of RWA              | Consumer  Banking/ Wealth  Management   | Institutional  Banking   | Treasury Markets   | Others (a)   | Group   |\n| Credit risk           | 83                                      | 95                       | 53                 | 74           | 86      |\n| Market risk           | 0                                       | 0                        | 42                 | 18           | 7       |\n| Operational risk      | 17                                      | 5                        | 5                  | 8            | 7       |\n\n(a) Encompasses assets/ RWA from capital and balance sheet management, funding and liquidity activities, DBS Vickers Group and The Islamic Bank of Asia Limited (b) Before goodwill and intangibles\n\n|\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nRisk that arises if our shareholder value (including earnings and capital) is adversely affected by any negative stakeholder perception of DBS' image.

These local risk committees oversee the local risk positions for all businesses and support units, ensuring that they keep within limits set by the Group risk committees. They also approve location-specific risk policies.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO), who is a member of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Chairman of the BRMC and the CEO, oversees the risk management function. The CRO is independent of business lines and is actively involved in key decision-making processes. He often engages with regulators to discuss risk matters, enabling a more holistic risk management perspective.\n\nWorking closely with the risk and business committees, the CRO is responsible for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Management of DBS' risks, including systems and processes to identify, approve, measure, monitor, control and report risks\n- \u00b7 Engagement with senior management about material matters regarding all risk types\n- \u00b7 Development of risk controls and mitigation processes\n- \u00b7 Ensuring DBS' risk management is effective, and the Risk Appetite established by the Board is adhered to\n\n## 4 Risk Appetite\n\nDBS' Risk Appetite is set by the Board and governed by the Risk Appetite Policy, which articulates the risks that we are willing to accept. It also serves to reinforce our risk culture by setting a clear message from the 'tone from the top'. A strong organisational risk culture, complemented with a balanced incentive framework (refer to 'Remuneration Report' section on page 61), helps to further embed our Risk Appetite.\n\n## 4.1 Risk thresholds and economic capital usage\n\nOur Risk Appetite takes into account a spectrum of risk types and is implemented using thresholds, policies, processes and controls.\n\nSetting thresholds is essential in making DBS' Risk Appetite an intrinsic part of our businesses as they help to keep all our risks within acceptable levels. Portfolio risk limits for the quantifiable risk types are established top down, and these are implemented using frameworks. As for the nonquantifiable risk types, these are managed using qualitative principles.\n\nTo ensure that the thresholds pertaining to our Risk Appetite are completely risk sensitive, we have adopted both economic capital (EC) and regulatory capital (RC) as our risk metrics. Additionally, both EC and RC are assessed as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\nOur capital allocation structure monitors regulatory capital demand at the business unit level, while other quantitative or qualitative controls are used to manage risks at granular levels. The risk types that are managed using capital are credit, market and operational risks. The diagram on the next page shows how they are managed along the dimensions of customer-facing and non-customer-facing units.\n\n|",

A buffer is also maintained for other risks, such as country, reputational, model risks, etc.\n\nThe following chart provides a broad overview of how our Risk Appetite permeates throughout DBS. Refer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis, and is conducted regularly. In particular, the ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning different risk types) is performed annually. In addition, stress tests are carried out in response to microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions, or portfolio developments. Every stress test is documented and the results are reviewed by senior management and/or the BRMC.\n\nStress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional but\n\nplausible adverse events. As such, stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.\n\nThe ICAAP ensures our business plans are consistent with our Risk Appetite. This is done by comparing the projected demand for capital to the projected supply of capital under various scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe most significant measurable risk DBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers. It includes the risk of lending, pre-settlement and settlement risk of foreign exchange, derivatives and debt securities.\n\nRefer to Note 42.1 to the financial statements on page 172 for details on DBS' maximum exposure to credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## 5.1 Credit risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\nProcesses, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe dimensions of credit risk and the scope of its application are defined in the Group Credit Risk Management Policy. Senior management sets the overall direction and policy for managing credit risk at the enterprise level.\n\nThe Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) established for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking set forth the principles by which DBS conducts its credit risk management and control activities. These policies, supplemented by a number of operational standards and guides, ensure consistency in identifying, assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across DBS, and provide guidance in the formulation of business-specific and/ or location-specific credit risk policies and standards.\n\nThe operational standards and guides are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group CCRPs and are adapted to reflect different credit environments and portfolio risk profiles. The CCRPs are approved by the GCPC.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nCredit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our corporate customers - the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate. It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.\n\nThe assignment of credit risk ratings and setting of lending limits are integral parts of DBS' credit risk management process, and we use an array of rating models for our corporate and retail portfolios. Most of these models are built internally using DBS' loss data, and the limits are driven by DBS' Risk Appetite Statement and the Target Market and Risk Acceptance Criteria (TM-RAC).\n\n|\n\nWholesale borrowers are assessed individually, and further reviewed and evaluated by experienced credit risk managers who consider relevant credit risk factors in the final determination of the borrower's risk. For some portfolios within the SME segment, DBS also uses a programme-based approach to achieve a balanced management of risks and rewards. Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behaviour records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC). Credit applications are proposed by the business units, and applications outside the RAC are independently assessed by the credit risk managers.\n\nRefer to Section 5.3 on page 85 to read more about our internal credit risk models.\n\nPre-settlement credit risk for traded products arising from a counterparty potentially defaulting on its obligations is generally quantified by evaluation of the market price plus potential future exposure. This is used to calculate DBS' regulatory capital and is included within DBS' overall credit limits to counterparties for internal risk management.\n\nWe actively monitor and manage our exposure to counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades to protect our balance sheet in the event of a counterparty default. Counterparty risk exposures that may be adversely affected by market risk events are identified, reviewed and acted upon by management, and highlighted to the appropriate risk committees. Specific wrongway risk arises when the credit exposure of a counterparty (from the traded product transaction) directly correlates with the probability of default of the counterparty. DBS has processes in place to guide the handling of specific wrong-way risk transactions, and its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated with such transactions.\n\nIssuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured based on jump-to-default computations.\n\n## Concentration risk management\n\nFor credit risk concentration, we use EC as our measurement tool as it combines the individual risk factors such as the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in addition to industry correlation and portfolio concentration. EC thresholds are set to ensure that the allocated EC stays within our Risk Appetite. Concentration risk for retail is managed at two levels - product level where exposure limits are set up and segment level\n\nto manage the growth of high-risk segments. Governance processes are in place to ensure that these thresholds are monitored regularly, and appropriate actions are taken when the thresholds are breached.\n\nDBS continually examines and reviews how we can enhance the scope of our thresholds and approaches to manage concentration risk.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risks\n\nResponsible financing, covering environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, is a topic of increasing importance that affects investing and lending decisions across the bank. DBS recognises that our financing practices have a substantial impact on society and failure of our customers to appropriately manage ESG issues can directly impact their operations and longterm economic viability, and the communities and environment in which they operate.\n\nThe Board approves DBS' overall and specific risk governance frameworks and oversees an independent Group-wide risk management system, including responsible financing. DBS had established a Group Responsible Financing Standard that documents our overarching approach to responsible financing and additional assessment required when entering into transactions with elevated ESG risks. The requirements of this Standard represent the minimum standards for DBS and we have also sought alignment, where possible, with international standards and best practices. Where significant ESG issues are identified, escalation is required to the relevant Global Industry Specialist and IBG Sustainability for further guidance prior to approval by the Credit Approving Authority.\n\nRefer more about \"Responsible financing\" in the Sustainability Report.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk refers to the risk of loss due to events in a specific country (or a group of countries). This includes political, exchange rate, economic, sovereign and transfer risks.\n\nDBS manages country risk through the requirements of the Group CCRP and the said risk is part of our concentration risk management. The way we manage transfer risk at DBS is set out in our Country Risk Management Standard. This includes an internal transfer risk and sovereign risk rating system, where assessments are made independently of business decisions. Our transfer risk limits are set in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Policy.",

Management actively evaluates and determines the appropriate level of transfer risk exposures for these countries taking into account the risks and rewards and whether they are in line with our strategic intent. Limits for all other nonpriority countries are set using a model-based approach.\n\nAll transfer risk limits are approved by the BRMC.\n\n## Credit stress testing\n\nDBS engages in various types of credit stress testing, and these are driven either by regulators or internal requirements and management.\n\nOur credit stress tests are performed at the total portfolio or sub-portfolio level, and are generally conducted to assess the impact of\n\nDBS typically performs the following types of credit stress testing at a minimum and others as necessary:\n\n| DBS conducts Pillar 1 credit stress testing regularly as required by regulators.

The purpose  of the Pillar 1 credit stress test is to assess the robustness of internal credit risk models and the cushion above  minimum regulatory capital.                                                                                                                                | Pillar 1 credit   stress testing    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| DBS conducts Pillar 2 credit stress testing once a year as part of the ICAAP. Under Pillar 2 credit stress testing,  DBS assesses the impact of stress scenarios, with different levels of severity, on asset quality, earnings  performance as well as internal and regulatory capital. The results of the credit stress test form inputs to  the capital planning process under ICAAP. The purpose of the Pillar 2 credit stress testing is to examine, in a  rigorous and forward-looking manner, the possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely  impact DBS and to develop the appropriate action plan. | Pillar 2 credit   stress testing    |\n| DBS participates in the annual industry-wide stress test (IWST) conducted by the Monetary Authority of  Singapore (MAS) to facilitate the ongoing assessment of Singapore's financial stability. Under the IWST, DBS  is required to assess the impact of adverse scenarios, as defined by the regulator, on asset quality, earnings  performance and capital adequacy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Industry-wide   stress testing      |\n| DBS also conducts multiple independent sensitivity analyses and credit portfolio reviews based on various  scenarios.

Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and external environmental factors potentially affecting credit risk profiles is key to our philosophy of effective credit risk management.\n\nIn addition, credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts and significant weak credits, are submitted to\n\nthe various risk committees, allowing key strategies and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also ensure that any credit risk taken complies with the credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.\n\nIndependent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme. These units oversee the implementation of credit stress tests as well as the analysis\n\nof the results, of which management, various risk committees and regulators are informed.\n\n## Non-performing assets\n\nDBS' credit facilities are classified as 'Performing assets' or 'Non-performing assets' (NPA), in accordance with the MAS Notice to Banks No. 612 'Credit Files, Grading and Provisioning' (MAS Notice 612 / MAS Notice 612A).\n\nCredit exposures are categorised into one of the following five categories, according to our assessment of a borrower's ability to repay a credit facility from its normal sources of income and/ or the repayment behaviour of the borrower.\n\nchanging economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity.

A restructured credit facility is classified into the appropriate non- performing grade based on the assessment of the borrower's financial condition and its ability to repay according to the restructured terms.\n\nSuch credit facilities are not returned to the performing status until there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the borrower will be able to service all future principal and interest payments on the credit facility in accordance with the restructured terms and MAS Notice 612 / MAS Notice 612A. Apart from what has been described, we do not grant concessions to borrowers in the normal course of business.\n\nIn addition, it is not within DBS' business model to acquire debts that have been restructured at inception (e.g. distressed debts).\n\nRefer to Note 2.11 to the financial statements on page 127 for our accounting policies regarding specific and general allowances for credit losses.\n\n|\n\nIn general, specific allowances are recognised for defaulting credit exposures rated substandard and below.\n\nThe breakdown of our NPA by loan grading and industry and the related amounts of specific allowances can be found in Note 42.2 to the financial statements on page 173. A breakdown of past due loans can also be found in the same note.\n\nWhen required, we will take possession of all collateral and dispose them as soon as practicable. Realised proceeds are used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\n\nA breakdown of collateral held for NPA is shown in Note 42.2 to the financial statements on page 176.\n\nRepossessed collateral is classified in the balance sheet as other assets. The amounts of such other assets for 2020 and 2021 were not material.\n\n## 5.2\n\n## Credit risk mitigants\n\n## Collateral received\n\nWhere possible, DBS takes collateral as a secondary source of repayment. This includes, but is not limited to, cash, marketable securities, real estate, trade receivables, inventory, equipment, and other physical and/ or financial collateral. We may also take fixed and floating charges on the assets of borrowers.\n\nPolicies are in place to determine the eligibility of collateral for credit risk mitigation. Collateral is generally diversified and periodic valuations of collateral are required. Real estate constitutes the bulk of our collateral, while marketable securities and cash are immaterial.\n\nFor derivatives, repurchase agreements (repo) and other repo-style transactions with financial market counterparties, collateral arrangements are typically covered under market-standard documentation, such as International Swaps &\n\nDerivatives Association (ISDA) Agreements and Master Repurchase Agreements.\n\nThe collateral received is marked-to- market on a frequency that DBS and the counterparties have mutually agreed upon. This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by master-netting arrangements where DBS is allowed to offset what we owe a counterparty against what is due from that counterparty in a netting-eligible jurisdiction.\n\nRefer to Note 14 to the financial statements on page 140 for further information on financial assets and liabilities subject to netting agreement but not offset on the balance sheet.\n\nCollateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly rated government or quasi- government bonds. Exceptions may arise in certain countries, where due to domestic capital markets and business conditions, the bank may be required to accept less highly rated or liquid government bonds and currencies. Reverse repo-transactions are generally traded with large institutions with reasonably good credit standing. DBS takes haircuts against the underlying collateral of these transactions that commensurate with collateral quality to ensure credit risks are adequately mitigated.\n\nIn times of difficulty, we will review the customers' specific situation and circumstances to assist them in restructuring their financial obligations.\n\nHowever, should the need arise, disposal and recovery processes are in place to dispose the collateral held. DBS maintains a panel of agents and solicitors to assist in the disposal of non-liquid assets and specialised equipment quickly.",

        "page_content": "## Collateral posted\n\nDBS is required to post additional collateral in the event of a rating downgrade. As at 31 December 2021, for a three-notch downgrade of its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Services ratings, DBS will have to post additional collateral amounting to SGD 2 million (2020: SGD 11 million).\n\n## Other credit risk mitigants\n\nDBS accepts guarantees as credit risk mitigants. Internal requirements for considering the eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.\n\n## 5.3 Internal credit risk models\n\nDBS adopts rating systems for the different asset classes under the Internal Ratings - Based Approach (IRBA).\n\nThere is a robust governance process for the development, independent validation and approval of any credit risk model. The models go through a rigorous review process before they are endorsed by the GCRMC and Risk EXCO. They must also be approved by the BRMC before submission for regulatory approval. The key risk measures generated by the internal credit risk rating models to quantify regulatory capital include PD, LGD and EAD. For portfolios under the Foundation IRBA, internal estimates of PD are used while the supervisory LGD and EAD estimates are applied. For portfolios under the Advanced IRBA, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD are used. In addition, the ratings from the credit models act as the basis for underwriting credit risk, monitoring portfolio performance and determining business strategies. The performance of the rating systems is monitored regularly and reported to the GCRMC, Risk EXCO and BRMC to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\nAn independent risk unit conducts formal validations for the respective rating systems annually. The validation processes are also independently reviewed by Group Audit. These serve to highlight material deterioration in the rating systems for management attention.\n\n## 5.3.1 Retail exposure models\n\nRetail portfolios are categorised into the following asset classes under the Advanced IRBA: residential mortgages, qualifying revolving retail exposures and other retail exposures.\n\nWithin each asset class, exposures are managed on a portfolio basis. Each customer or account is assigned to a risk pool, considering factors such as borrower characteristics and collateral type. PD, EAD and LGD estimates are based on internal historical\n\ndefault, utilisation and realised losses within a defined period.\n\nProduct-specific credit risk elements such as underwriting criteria, scoring models, approving authorities and asset quality and business strategy reviews, as well as systems, processes and techniques to monitor portfolio performance, are in place. Credit risk models for secured and unsecured portfolios are also used to update the risk level of each loan on a monthly basis, reflecting the broad usage of risk models in portfolio quality reviews.\n\n## 5.3.2 Wholesale exposure models\n\nWholesale exposures are under the Foundation IRBA for capital computation. They include sovereign, bank and corporate. Specialised lending exposures are under IRBA using supervisory slotting criteria.\n\nSovereign exposures are risk-rated using internal risk-rating models. Factors related to country-specific macroeconomic risk, political risk, social risk and liquidity risk are included in the sovereign rating models to assess the sovereign credit risk in an objective and systematic manner.\n\nBank exposures are assessed using the bank-rating model. The model considers both quantitative and qualitative factors such as capital levels and liquidity, asset quality and management strength.\n\nLarge corporate exposures are assessed using internal rating models. Factors considered in the risk assessment process include the counterparty's financial strength and qualitative factors such as industry risk, access to funding, market standing and management strength.\n\nSME credit rating models consider risk factors such as those relating to the counterparty's financial strength, qualitative factors, as well as account performance.\n\nCredit risk ratings under the IRBA portfolios are, at a minimum, reviewed by designated approvers on an annual basis unless credit conditions require more frequent assessment.\n\n## 5.3.3 Specialised lending exposures\n\nSpecialised lending IRBA portfolios include income-producing real estate, project finance, object finance, and commodities finance. These adopt the supervisory slotting criteria specified under Annex 7v of MAS Notice 637, which are used to determine the risk weights to calculate credit risk-weighted exposures.\n\n## 5.3.4 Securitisation exposures\n\nWe arrange securitisation transactions for our clients for fees. These transactions do not\n\ninvolve special-purpose entities that we control. For transactions that are not underwritten, no securitisation exposures are assumed as a direct consequence of arranging the transactions. Any decision to invest in any of such arranged transactions is subject to independent risk assessment.\n\nWhere DBS provides an underwriting commitment, any securitisation exposure that arises will be held in the trading book to be traded or sold down in accordance with our internal policy and risk limits. In addition, DBS does not provide implicit support for any transactions we structure or have invested in.\n\nWe invest in our clients' securitisation transactions from time to time. These may include securitisation transactions arranged by us or with other parties.\n\nWe may also act as a liquidity facility provider, working capital facility provider or swap counterparty. Such exposures require the approval of the independent risk function and are subject to regular risk reviews. We also have processes in place to monitor the credit risk of our securitisation exposures.\n\n## 5.3.5 Credit exposures falling outside internal credit risk models\n\nDBS applies the Standardised Approach (SA) for portfolios that are expected to transit to IRBA or for portfolios that are immaterial in terms of size and risk profile. These portfolios include:\n\n- \u00b7 IRBA-transitioning retail and wholesale exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt retail exposures\n- \u00b7 IRBA-exempt wholesale exposures\n\nAny identified transitioning retail and/ or wholesale exposures are expected to adopt Advanced or Foundation IRBA, subject to approval by regulators. Prior to regulatory approval, these portfolios are under SA.\n\nThe portfolios under the SA are subject to our overall governance framework and credit risk management practices. DBS continues to monitor the size and risk profile of these portfolios and will enhance the relevant risk measurement processes if these risk exposures become material.\n\nDBS uses external ratings for credit exposures under the SA where relevant, and we only accept ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in such cases. DBS follows the process prescribed in MAS Notice 637 to map the ratings to the relevant risk weights.",

This policy is supplemented with standards and guides, which facilitate the identification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting of market risk in a consistent manner. They also set out the overall approach, requirements and controls governing market risk stress testing across DBS.\n\nThe criteria for determining the positions to be included in the trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS utilises Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from market movements. This measure uses historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. It assumes that historical changes in market values reflect the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future.\n\nDBS limits and monitors market risk exposures using Expected Shortfall (ES) that is VaR calculated with a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 97.5% confidence interval.\n\nES is supplemented with other risk control metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action.\n\nDBS conducts backtesting to verify the predictiveness of the VaR model. Backtesting compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the profit and loss (P&L) that arises from those positions on the following business day. The backtesting P&L excludes fees and commissions, revenues\n\nfrom intra-day trading, non-daily valuation adjustments and time effects.\n\nFor backtesting, VaR at the 99% confidence interval and over a one-day holding period is used. We adopt the standardised approach to compute market risk regulatory capital under MAS Notice 637 for the trading book positions. As such, VaR backtesting does not impact our regulatory capital for market risk.\n\nThere are limitations to VaR models; for example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may not be considered.\n\nTo monitor DBS' vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, we conduct multiple market risk stress tests regularly. These cover trading and nontrading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting risk-factor movement.\n\nEconomic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) variability are the key risk metrics used to manage our assets and liabilities. EVE and NII variability measure how the economic value and earnings of the bank change under various stress scenarios. Credit risk arising from loans and receivables is managed under the credit risk management framework.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) arises from mismatches in the interest rate profiles of assets, liabilities and capital instruments. Estimating IRRBB requires the use of behavioural models and assumptions on certain parameters such as loan prepayment, fixed deposits early redemption and the duration of non- maturity deposits. DBS measures IRRBB on a monthly basis.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support our market risk management approach. DBS reviews these control processes and systems regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their effectiveness.\n\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit an independent market risk management function reporting to the CRO - monitors, controls and analyses DBS' market risk daily. The unit comprises risk control, risk analytics, production and reporting teams.",

It\n\nassesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash flow shortfalls that may occur as forecasted in the cash flow movements across successive time bands. To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-specified for monitoring and control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action.\n\nLiquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash flow maturity mismatch analysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-offs increase, asset rollovers increase and/ or liquid asset buffers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress tests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises.\n\nLiquidity risk control measures such as liquidity-related ratios and balance sheet analysis are complementary tools for cash flow maturity mismatch analysis, and they are performed regularly to obtain deeper insights and finer control over our liquidity profile across different locations.\n\nThe liquidity risk control measures also include concentration measures regarding top depositors, wholesale borrowing and swapped funds ratios.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nRobust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements\n\n| SGD million (a)                                    | Less than        1 week   | 1 week to   1 month   | 1 to 3  months   | 3 to 6 months   | 6 months to   1 year   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| As at 31 Dec 2021 (b)  Net liquidity mismatch      | 37,477                    | 20,619                | (6,556)          | 13,624          | 7,136                  |\n| Cumulative mismatch                                | 37,477                    | 58,096                | 51,540           | 65,164          | 72,300                 |\n| As at 31 Dec 2020 (b) (c)  Net liquidity  mismatch | 26,191                    | 12,542                | 6,407            | 9,742           | 6,158                  |\n| Cumulative mismatch                                | 26,191                    | 38,733                | 45,140           | 54,882          | 61,040                 |\n\n- (a) Positive indicates a position of liquidity surplus.

In fact, they consistently exhibit stability even under historic periods of stress. A conservative view is adopted in the behavioural profiling of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments that have exhibited cash flow patterns that differ significantly from the contractual maturity profile shown under Note 43.1 of our financial statements on page 179.\n\nThe table below shows our behavioural net and cumulative maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities over a one-year period, in a normal scenario without incorporating growth projections. DBS' liquidity was observed to remain adequate in the maturity mismatch analysis. In 2021, the liquidity profile improved as excess liquidity from deposit growth is retained in short term funds.",

DBS' Treasury function expects to be able to operationally monetise our pool of liquid assets to meet liquidity shortfalls when the need arises. These liquid assets must be unencumbered and free of any legal, regulatory, contractual or other restrictions.\n\nIn practice, liquid assets are maintained in key locations and currencies to ensure that operating entities in such locations possess a degree of selfsufficiency to support business needs and guard against contingencies. The main portion of our liquid assets is centrally maintained in Singapore to support liquidity needs in smaller overseas subsidiaries and branches. Internally, DBS sets a requirement to maintain its pool of liquid assets above a minimum level as a source of contingent funds, taking into account regulatory recommended liquid asset levels as well as internally projected stress shortfalls under the cash flow maturity mismatch analysis.\n\nThe table below shows DBS' encumbered and unencumbered liquid assets by instrument and counterparty against other assets in the same category under the balance sheet.

Group LCR has been maintained well above the minimum LCR requirements of 100% for both all-currency and SGD.\n\nDBS' LCR is sensitive to balance sheet movements resulting from commercial loan/ deposit activities, wholesale inter-bank lending/ borrowing, and to the maturity tenor changes of these positions as they fall into or out of the LCR 30-day tenor. In order to meet the LCR requirements, DBS holds a pool of unencumbered High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) comprising predominantly cash, balances with central banks and highly rated bonds issued by governments or supranational entities.\n\n## 7.5 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nDBS is subject to the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under MAS Notice to Banks No. 652 'Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)' (MAS Notice 652). Group NSFR has been maintained consistently above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\nNSFR aims to improve the resiliency of banks by promoting long term funding stability. We manage our NSFR by maintaining a stable balance sheet supported by a diversified funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels.",

DBS' objective is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, taking into account the markets we operate in, the characteristics of the businesses as well as our economic and regulatory environment.\n\n## 8.1 Operational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to operational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nThe Group Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy sets our overall approach for managing operational risk in a structured, systematic and consistent manner.\n\nThere are policies, standards, tools and programmes in place to govern ORM practices across DBS. These include corporate operational risk policies and standards that are owned by the respective corporate oversight and control functions. The key policies address risk areas relating to technology, compliance, fraud, money laundering, financing of terrorism and sanctions, new product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nDBS adopts the standardised approach to compute operational risk regulatory capital.\n\nTo manage and control operational risk, we use various tools, including risk and control self-assessment, operational risk event management and key risk indicator monitoring.\n\nDBS' three lines of defence adopt one common risk taxonomy, and a consistent risk assessment approach to managing operational risk. Risk and control self- assessment is conducted by each business or support unit to identify key operational risk and assess the effectiveness of internal controls. When control issues are identified, the units develop action plans and track the resolution of the issues.\n\nOperational risk events are classified in accordance with Basel standards. Such events, including any significant incidents that may impact DBS' reputation, must be reported based on certain established thresholds. Key risk indicators with pre- defined escalation\n\n|\n\ntriggers are employed to facilitate risk monitoring in a forward- looking manner.\n\nAdditional methodologies are in place to address subject-specific risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n## Technology risk\n\nInformation Technology (IT) risk is managed through an enterprise technology risk management approach. This covers risk identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting. In addition, the appropriate governance, IT policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programmes are in place to support the risk management approach.\n\n## Cyber security risk\n\nCyber security risk is an important and continuous focus of the bank. DBS devotes significant attention and resources to protect and improve the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against the emerging and evolving landscape. The bank manages cyber security risk, which cuts across all lines of business. The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) oversees the cyber security function and the one-stop competency centre for all cyber security related matters, such as operational risks and data protection risks.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nCompliance risk refers to the risk of DBS not being able to successfully conduct our business because of any failure to comply with laws, regulatory requirements, industry codes or standards of business and professional conduct applicable to the financial sector.\n\nThis includes, in particular, laws and regulations applicable to the licensing and conducting of banking or other financial businesses, financial crime such as antimoney laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), fraud and bribery/ corruption. We maintain a compliance programme designed to identify, assess, measure, mitigate and report on such risks through a combination of policy and relevant systems and controls.\n\nTo counter financial crime and sanctions risks, DBS established minimum standards for our business and support units to manage our actual and/ or potential risk exposures. In addition, standards aimed to provide the end-to-end management for fraud and related issues at the unit and geographical levels, were implemented through the Fraud Management\n\nProgramme. We implement surveillance and compliance testing controls where necessary to obtain assurance that the control framework is operating effectively.\n\nDBS also provides relevant training and implements assurance processes. We strongly believe in the need to promote a strong compliance culture as well, and this is developed through the leadership of our Board and senior management.\n\n## New product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership risks\n\nEach new product, service, outsourcing arrangement or ecosystem partnership is subject to a risk review and sign-off process, where relevant risks are identified and assessed. Variations of existing products or services and existing outsourcing arrangements and ecosystem partnerships are also subject to a similar process.\n\n## Other mitigation programmes\n\nA robust business continuity management programme is in place to ensure that essential banking services can continue in the event of unforeseen events or business disruptions. This includes a crisis management plan to enable quick response to manage incidents. Exercises are conducted annually, simulating different scenarios to test business continuity plans and crisis management protocol. The effectiveness of these exercises as well as DBS' business continuity readiness and our alignment to regulatory guidelines are communicated and attested by senior management to the BRMC annually.\n\nAmid the Covid-19 pandemic, our business continuity plans were put to the test and kept the bank in good stead. We were able to quickly adapt and adjust to the pandemic to ensure minimal impact on our customers and assure the health and safety of our employees. We dialled up our work-fromhome capabilities by leveraging technology and data, and proactively managed the operational risks which arose from new or revised processes as we moved towards a hybrid work arrangement.\n\nTo mitigate losses from specific risk events which are unexpected and significant, DBS effects group-wide insurance coverage under the Group Insurance Programme. These insurance policies relate to crime and professional indemnity, directors and officers liability, cyber risk, property damage and business interruption, general liability and terrorism.",

These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks)\n- \u00b7 Inherent risk (operational and business/ strategic risks)\n\n## 9.1 Reputational risk management at DBS\n\nDBS' approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\n\n## Policies\n\nRisk methodologies\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\n## Policies\n\nDBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate and respond to reputational risk events.\n\nAs reputational risk is a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the definitions and principles for managing such risks are articulated in the respective risk policies. These are reinforced by sound\n\n|\n\ncorporate values that reflect ethical behaviours and practices throughout DBS.\n\nAt DBS, we have policies in place to protect the consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and reputation.\n\n## Risk methodologies\n\nUnder the various risk policies, we have established a number of mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring.\n\nThese mechanisms take the form of risk limits, key risk indicators and other operating metrics, and include the periodic risk and control self-assessment process. Apart from observations from internal sources, alerts from external parties/ stakeholders also serve as an important source to detect potential reputational risk events. In addition, there are policies relating to media communications, social media and corporate social responsibility to protect DBS' reputation. There are also escalation and response mechanisms in place for managing reputational risk.\n\nWhile the respective risk policies address the individual risk types, the Reputational Risk Policy focuses specifically on our stakeholders' perception of how well DBS manages its reputational risks. Stakeholders include customers, government agencies and regulators, investors, rating agencies, business alliances, vendors, trade unions, the media, the general public, the Board and senior\n\nmanagement, and DBS' employees.\n\nWe recognise that creating a sense of shared value through engagement with key stakeholder groups is imperative for our brand and reputation.\n\nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on page 76.\n\n## Processes, systems and reports\n\nOur units are responsible for the day-to- day management of reputational risk, and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess and respond to this risk. This includes social media monitoring to pick up adverse comments on DBS. Events affecting DBS' reputational risk are also included in our reporting of risk profiles to senior management and Board-level committees.\n\n## 9.2 Reputational risk in 2021\n\nDBS' priority is to prevent the occurrence of a reputational risk event, instead of taking mitigating action when it occurs. In relation to the two-day digital disruption in November 2021 which impacted the Bank's reputation, concerted efforts were made to recover the banking services as soon as possible and to keep customers updated on the recovery progress via various communication channels. Following the incident, management has initiated remedial measures to improve the resilience of our services and incident response, with due consideration given to regulatory requirements and expectations.",

The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration our strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nOur dividend policy is to pay sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. With the lifting of regulatory restrictions on 28 July 2021, we reverted dividend to its pre-pandemic level of SGD 0.33 per ordinary share from the second quarter of FY2021. In line with our dividend policy, the Board has recommended a final dividend of SGD 0.36 per ordinary share, a 9% increase from the previous payout. This will bring the total ordinary dividend for the year to SGD 1.20 per share. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend going forward would be SGD 1.44 per share. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will not be applied to the final dividend.\n\n## Process\n\nOur capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and our capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of differing scope and severity.\n\nCapital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored throughout the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure that each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.\n\nDuring the course of the year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.\n\n## Capital structure\n\nWe manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and flexibility offered by various capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital. The following capital transactions were undertaken during the year.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n\n- \u00b7 DBS Group Holdings Ltd, on 24 May 2021, issued 5,967,122 ordinary shares pursuant to the Scrip Dividend Scheme in respect of the 2020 final dividend.

Under the MAS' framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the set of indicators which are included in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default. page).\n\nOn 7 May 2019, the MAS first released a consultation paper on 'Proposed Implementation of the Final Basel III Reforms in Singapore', seeking feedback on proposed revisions to the capital requirements and leverage ratio requirements for Singapore-incorporated banks to align with the Basel III reforms. On 7 April 2020, the MAS announced that the implementation date of the Basel III reforms had been deferred by one year to 1 January 2023 to enable banks to prioritise their resources in response to COVID-19. On 25 March 2021, the MAS released a consultation paper on 'Draft Standards for Credit Risk Capital and Output Floor Requirements for Singapore-incorporated banks' to seek further feedback. The revised standards are expected to take effect from 1 January 2023, with transitional arrangements provided for implementation of the output floor till 1 January 2028. On 13 September 2021, the MAS released a consultation paper on 'Draft Standards for Market Risk Capital and Capital Reporting Requirements for Singapore-Incorporated Banks', seeking feedback on the draft standards. The MAS intends to implement the revised standards for market risk capital for supervisory reporting purposes from 1 January 2023, and for the purposes of compliance with capital adequacy and disclosure requirements from 1 January 2023 or later.\n\nWith effect from 1 July 2021, MAS Notice 637 was amended to specify that the transitional arrangements for the adoption of the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk ('SA-CCR') and the revised capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties will cease on 31 December 2021. It also reflects amendments setting out an alternative treatment for the measurement of derivatives exposures for leverage ratio calculation, using a modified version of SA-CCR as well as other amendments to implement technical revisions to the credit risk framework. Further amendments to MAS Notice 637 were made with effect from 18 August 2021 to implement the framework for the treatment of major stake investments in financial institutions at the Solo level.\n\nWith effect from 31 December 2021, MAS Notice 637 was amended to incorporate edits in relation to the insertion of a new charge to be held by the Housing and Development Board under the Prime Location Public Housing model. Further amendments effective from 1 January 2022 were also made to MAS Notice 637 to: (a) incorporate clarifications to the SA-CCR framework and the revised capital requirements for bank exposures to central counterparties, (b) implement revisions to the internal ratings-based approach application process and (c) implement technical revisions to the disclosure framework.",

Details of the DBSH Share Plan are set out in Note 39 of the Notes to the 2021 Company's financial statements\n\nThere was no change in any of the above-mentioned interests between the end of the financial year and 21 January 2022.\n\n## DBSH Share Plan\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2019, the DBSH Share Plan (which was first adopted on 18 September 1999) was extended for another ten years, from 18 September 2019 to 17 September 2029 (both dates inclusive). The DBSH Share Plan is administered by the Compensation and Management Development Committee (CMDC). As at the date of this statement, the members of the CMDC are Mr Anthony Lim (Chairman), Mr Peter Seah, Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal and Ms Judy Lee.\n\nUnder the terms of the DBSH Share Plan:\n\n- (a) Awards over DBSH's ordinary shares may be granted to Group executives who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time. Awards may also be granted to (amongst others) executives of associated companies of DBSH who hold such rank as may be determined by the CMDC from time to time, and non-executive Directors of DBSH;\n- (b) Where time-based awards are granted, participants are awarded ordinary shares of DBSH or, at the CMDC's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination of both as part of their deferred bonus, at the end of the prescribed vesting periods. Awards are granted under the DBSH Share Plan at the absolute discretion of the CMDC. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees;",

In addition, during the financial year, certain non-executive Directors received an aggregate of 34,017 share awards which vested immediately upon grant.

        "page_content": "## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 We determined the overall Group materiality based on 5% of the Group's profit before tax.\n\n## Group scoping\n\n- \u00b7 Full scope audit procedures were performed over the Singapore Operations of DBS Bank Ltd. and DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited ('significant components').\n- \u00b7 We identified DBS Bank Ltd. Hong Kong, Taipei and Seoul Branches, DBS Bank (China) Limited, PT Bank DBS Indonesia, DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd and DBS Bank India Limited as component entities where certain account balances were considered to be significant in size in relation to the Group ('other components'). Consequently, audit and specified procedures for the significant account balances of these components were performed to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 Specific allowances for loans and advances to customers\n- \u00b7 General allowances for credit losses (Stage 1 and 2 Expected Credit Loss)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill\n- \u00b7 Valuation of financial instruments held at fair value\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanying financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including, among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| How we determined overall Group materiality   | 5% of the Group's profit before tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rationale for benchmark applied               | \u00b7  We chose 'profit before tax' as, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which performance of the Group is most commonly measured.  \u00b7  We selected 5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is  also within the range of commonly accepted profit-related thresholds. |\n\nIn performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the significant components and other components of the Group.

        "page_content": "## How we developed the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. The Group's financial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology ('IT') systems. Our audit scope included testing the operating effectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key financial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.\n\nIn establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed across the Group by us or by other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective territory, (the 'component auditors'). Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the procedures to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Specific allowances for loans and advances to customers\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the specific allowances for loans and advances to customers of the Group was $2,545 million, the majority of which related to Institutional Banking Group ('IBG') customers. Specific allowances refer to loss allowances for credit-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 3, per SFRS (I) 9). Expected Credit Losses ('ECL') on non-impaired exposures (i.e. Stage 1 and Stage 2) are set out under the 'General allowances for credit losses' key audit matter.\n\nWe focused on this area because of the subjective judgements used by management in determining the necessity for, and estimating the size of, allowances against loans and advances.\n\nIn particular, we focused on specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers because any assessment of impairment can be inherently subjective and involves significant judgement over both the timing of recognition of any impairment and the estimation of the size of such impairment. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the principal assumptions underlying the calculation of specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers where there is evidence of impairment losses (including the future profitability of the borrowers and the expected realisable value of collateral held); and\n- \u00b7 the classification of loans and advances in line with MAS Notice 612 ('MAS 612') and 612A ('MAS 612A').\n\nWe applied judgement in selecting samples focused on borrowers with exposures to certain sectors in view of continued heightened credit risks and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the portfolio.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 18 to the financial statements.)\n\n|\n\nWe assessed the design and evaluated the operating effectiveness of the controls over the specific allowances for loans and advances to IBG customers. These controls included:\n\n- \u00b7 oversight of credit risk by the Group Credit Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 timely management review of credit risk;\n- \u00b7 the watchlist identification and monitoring process;\n- \u00b7 timely identification of impairment events;\n- \u00b7 classification of loans and advances in line with MAS 612 and MAS612A; and\n- \u00b7 the collateral monitoring and valuation processes.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on these controls for the purposes of our audit.\n\nWe inspected a sample of loans and advances to IBG customers to assess whether the classification of the loans and advances was in line with MAS 612 and MAS 612A and, where there was evidence of an impairment loss, whether it had been identified in a timely manner. This included, where relevant, how forbearance had been considered, with particular focus on the impact of COVID-19.\n\nWhere impairment had been identified, for a sample of loans and advances, our work included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower;\n- \u00b7 examining the forecasts of future cash flows prepared by management, including key assumptions in relation to the amount and timing of recoveries;\n- \u00b7 comparing the collateral valuation and other sources of repayment to support the calculation of the impairment against external evidence, where available, including independent valuation reports;\n- \u00b7 challenging management's assumptions; and\n- \u00b7 testing the calculations.\n\nFor a sample of performing loans and advances to IBG customers which had not been identified by management as potentially impaired, considering the latest developments in relation to the borrower, we challenged management's assumptions on whether their classification was appropriate, using external evidence where available in respect of the relevant borrower.\n\nBased on procedures performed, we have assessed that the aggregate specific allowance for loans and advances is appropriate.",

The valuations of 'Level 3' instruments rely on significant unobservable inputs.\n\nWe considered the overall valuation of financial instruments (Level 1, 2 and 3) to be a key audit matter given the financial significance to the Group, the nature of the underlying products and the estimation involved to determine fair value.\n\nIn determining fair value, management also make adjustments to recognise credit risk, funding costs, bid-offer spreads and, in some cases, parameter and model risk limitations. This is broadly consistent with the banking industry, albeit the methodology to calculate some of these adjustments is continuing to evolve.\n\n(Refer also to Notes 3 and 41 to the financial statements.)\n\n## Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Statement (but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and the other sections of the Annual Report ('the Other Sections') which are expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nWhen we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I)s, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n|\n\nWe assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Group's financial instruments valuation processes. These included the controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 management's testing and approval of new models and revalidation of existing models;\n- \u00b7 the completeness and accuracy of pricing data inputs into valuation models;\n- \u00b7 monitoring of collateral disputes; and\n- \u00b7 governance mechanisms and monitoring over the valuation processes (including derivative valuation adjustments) by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and the Group Valuation Committee.\n\nWe determined that we could rely on the controls for the purposes of our audit. In addition, we:\n\n- \u00b7 engaged our own specialists to use their own models and input sources to determine an independent estimate of fair value for a sample of the Group's Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments. We compared these to the Group's calculations of fair value to assess individual material valuation differences or systemic bias;\n- \u00b7 assessed the reasonableness of the methodologies used and the assumptions made for a sample of financial instrument valuations with significant unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3 instruments);\n- \u00b7 performed procedures on collateral disputes to identify possible indicators of inappropriate valuations;\n- \u00b7 performed tests of inputs and assessed the methodology over fair value adjustments, in light of available market data and industry trends; and\n- \u00b7 considered the implications of global reforms to Interest Reference Rates ('IBOR Reform') in our assessment of fair value.\n\nOverall, we considered that the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value was within a reasonable range of outcomes.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors, have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Antony Eldridge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nPublic Accountants and Chartered Accountants\n\nSingapore, 11 February 2022",

Domicile and Activities\n\nThe Company, DBS Group Holdings Ltd, is incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Singapore and has its registered office at 12 Marina Boulevard, Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower Three, Singapore 018982.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe Company is an investment holding, treasury and funding vehicle for the group. Its main subsidiary is DBS Bank Ltd. (the Bank), which is wholly owned and engaged in a range of commercial banking and financial services, principally in Asia.\n\nThe financial statements relate to the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) and the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures.\n\n## 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\n## Compliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))\n\nThe financial statements of the Company and the consolidated financial statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act (the Act), the Company's income statement has not been included in these financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 2.2 Significant estimates and judgement\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from these estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are significant to the financial statements, and areas involving a higher degree of judgement and complexity, are disclosed in Note 3.\n\n|\n\n## 2.3 New or amended SFRS(I) and Interpretations effective for 2021 year-end\n\nOn 1 January 2021, the Group adopted 'Amendments to SFRS(I) 9, SFRS(I) 1-39, SFRS(I) 7, SFRS(I) 4, SFRS(I) 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2'. These amendments represent the second phase of SFRS(I) amendments ('Phase 2' amendments), which were issued due to global reform of interest rate benchmarks, such as Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including replacing them with Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs). In accordance with the transitional provisions, the amendments have been adopted retrospectively. There is no material impact to the Group's financial statements.\n\nFurther information is included in Note 37.\n\n## 2.4 New SFRS(I) and Interpretations effective for future periods\n\nThe amendments and interpretations effective for future periods do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A) General Accounting Policies\n\nA summary of the significant group accounting policies is described further below starting with those relating to the entire financial statements, followed by those relating to the income statement, the balance sheet and other specific topics. This does not reflect the relative importance of these policies to the Group.\n\n## 2.5 Group  Accounting\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group to the date control ceases.\n\nThe acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group's accounting policy on goodwill.\n\nAll intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but no control, where the Group generally holds a shareholding of between and including 20% and 50% of the voting rights.\n\nJoint ventures are entities which the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost. On acquisition, when the Group's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the investment exceeds the cost of acquisition paid by the Group, the excess is recognised in profit and loss as part of the share of profit from associates and joint ventures.",

        "page_content": "Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, these investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of post-acquisition profits or losses and the Group's share of other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction of the carrying amount of the investments.\n\n## 2.6 Foreign currency treatment\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems in the financial statements are measured using the functional currency of each entity in the Group, this being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Group's financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2021, the functional currency of the Treasury Markets trading business in Singapore ('TM Singapore') changed prospectively from Singapore dollars to US dollars (USD).\n\nThe transition to the new USD functional currency on 1 January 2021 had no impact on the income statement or equity on transition date. The change in functional currency better reflects the increasing dominance of the USD in the business activities of TM Singapore.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising from this translation are recognised in the income statement within 'Net trading income'.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date.\n\nUnrealised foreign exchange differences arising from non-monetary financial assets and liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income.\n\nNon-monetary financial assets that are classified at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting treatment of FVOCI equities.\n\n## Subsidiaries and branches\n\nThe results and financial position of subsidiaries and branches whose functional currency is not Singapore dollars ('foreign operations') are translated into Singapore dollars in the following manner:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date;\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses in the income statement are translated at exchange rates prevailing at each month-end, approximating the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under capital reserves in equity. When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss.\n\nFor acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Please refer to Note 27 for an overview of goodwill recorded. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.\n\n## 2.7 Segment reporting\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management.\n\nIn preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nPlease refer to Note 45 for further details on business and geographical segment reporting.",

        "page_content": "## B) Income Statement\n\n## 2.8 Income  recognition\n\n## Interest income and interest expense\n\nInterest is accrued on all interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities, regardless of their classification and measurement, except for limited transactions measured at FVPL where the economics are better reflected in 'Net trading income'.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised on a timeproportionate basis using the effective interest method. The calculation includes significant fees and transaction costs that are integral to the effective interest rate, as well as premiums or discounts.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nThe Group earns fee and commission income from a diverse range of products and services provided to its customers. Fee and commission income are recognised when the Group has satisfied its performance obligation in providing the promised products and services to the customer, and are recognised based on contractual rates agreed with customers, net of expected waivers based on historical experience, and net of expenses directly related to it. The Group generally satisfies its performance obligation and recognises the fee and commission income on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction-based fee and commission income is recognised on the completion of the transaction. Such fees include underwriting fees, brokerage fees, bancassurance sales commission and variable service fees, and fees related to the completion of corporate finance transactions.\n- \u00b7 For a service that is provided over a period of time, fee and commission income is generally recognised on equal proportion basis over the period during which the related service is provided or credit risk is undertaken. This basis of recognition most appropriately reflects the nature and pattern of provision of these services to the customers over time. Fees for these services can be billed to customers in advance or periodically over time. Such fees include the income from issuance of financial guarantees and bancassurance fixed service fees.\n\nThe Group does not provide any significant credit terms to customers for the above products and services.\n\nDirectly related expenses typically include brokerage fees paid, card-related expenses and sales commissions, but do not include expenses for services delivered over a period (such as service contracts) and other expenses that are not specifically related to fee and commission income transactions.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established. This is generally the ex-dividend date for listed equity securities, and the date when shareholders approve the dividend for unlisted equity securities. Dividend income arising from financial assets classified as FVPL is recognised in 'Net trading income', while those arising from FVOCI financial assets is recognised in 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n## Allowances for credit and other losses\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 for the accounting policy on impairment of financial assets.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## C) Balance Sheet\n\n## 2.9 Financial  assets\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nPurchases and sales of all financial assets are recognised on the date that the Group enters into the contractual arrangements with counterparties. When the Group acts as a trustee or in a fiduciary capacity for assets it does not directly control or benefit from, the assets and the corresponding income belonging to a customer are excluded from the financial statements.\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognised at fair value, which is generally the transaction price.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\nSFRS(I) 9 categorises debt-like financial assets based on the business model within which the assets are managed, and whether the assets constitute a 'basic lending arrangement' where their contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Interest is defined as consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and may include a profit margin.\n\nThe classification of the financial assets and the associated accounting treatment are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at amortised cost when they are in a 'hold to collect' (HTC) business model and have contractual cash flows that are SPPI in nature. The objective of a HTC business model is to collect contractual principal and interest cash flows. Sales are incidental to the objective and expected to be either insignificant or infrequent. These assets consist primarily of loans in the 'Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management' and 'Institutional Banking' segments as well as debt securities from the 'Others' segment.\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) when they are in a 'hold to collect & sell' (HTC & S) business model and have cash flows that are SPPI in nature. Both the collection of contractual cash flows and sales are integral to achieving the objective of the HTC & S business model. Assets measured at FVOCI comprise mainly of debt securities from 'Treasury Markets' and the 'Others' segment.\n\nUnrealised gains or losses on FVOCI debt instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. When they are sold, the accumulated fair value adjustments in FVOCI are reclassified to the income statement as 'Net income from investment securities'.\n\n- \u00b7 Debt instruments are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) when:\n- i) the assets are not SPPI in nature;\n- ii) the assets are not part of a 'HTC' or 'HTC & S' business model; or\n- iii)  the assets are designated at FVPL to eliminate or significantly reduce the measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on different bases.\n\nAssets measured at FVPL are mainly recorded in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. Realised and unrealised gains or losses on FVPL financial assets are taken to the income statement in the period they arise.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Subsequent changes in fair value of non-trading equity can be taken through profit or loss or comprehensive income, as elected. The Group generally elects its non-trading equity instruments to be classified as FVOCI. Other than dividend income, gains and losses on FVOCI equity instruments are recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves, and not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition.\n- \u00b7 Derivatives (including derivatives embedded in financial liabilities but separated for accounting purposes) are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of derivatives other than those designated as hedging instruments in cash flow or net investment hedges are included in 'Net trading income'.\n\n## Reclassification\n\nReclassification of financial assets are prohibited unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets. In practice, this is expected to be infrequent.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of financial assets is the price that would be received if the asset is sold in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is generally estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments. Where applicable, a valuation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair value. The determination of fair value is considered a significant accounting policy for the Group and further details are disclosed in Note 41.\n\n## Offsetting\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle them on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or when they have been transferred together with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\nThe Group enters into certain transactions where it transfers financial assets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred financial assets. In such cases, the transferred financial assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. Such transactions include repurchase agreements described in Note 2.12. They also include transactions where control over the financial asset is retained, for example, by a simultaneous transaction (such as options) with the same counterparty to which the asset is transferred. These are mainly transacted in the 'Treasury Markets' segment. In such cases, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement which is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.\n\nPlease refer to Note 19 for disclosures on transferred financial assets.\n\n## 2.10 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with central banks which are readily convertible into cash.\n\n## 2.11 Impairment of financial assets at amortised cost and FVOCI\n\n## Expected Credit Losses (ECL)\n\nECL are recognised for all financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financial asset, guarantee or undrawn commitment.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events that may occur within the next 12 months ('12-month ECL'). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument ('lifetime ECL').\n\nThe ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: financial instruments where 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; financial instruments which experience a significant increase in credit risk are in Stage 2; and financial instruments with objective evidence of default or credit-impaired are in Stage 3.\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 1 - Financial instruments are classified as Stage 1 at initial recognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a significant increase in credit risk or become credit-impaired. 12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 - Financial instruments which experience a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Lifetime ECL is recognised for these instruments.\n\nSignificant increase in credit risk (SICR): SICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at reporting date to the risk of default at origination using a range of qualitative and quantitative factors.\n\nFor wholesale exposures, a financial instrument is deemed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk when:\n\n- \u00b7 the observed change in its probability of default (PD), as observed by downgrades in the Group's internal credit risk rating for this instrument between origination and reporting dates, is more than pre-specified thresholds; or\n- \u00b7 it is placed on internal credit watchlists for closer scrutiny of developing credit issues.\n\nFor retail exposures, days past due is the main driver, supplemented with a PD-based criterion. In any event, all retail and wholesale exposures that are more than 30 days past due are presumed to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, unless assessed otherwise, and are classified as Stage 2.\n\nInstruments in Stage 2 that no longer exhibit a significant increase in credit risk will be transferred back to Stage 1.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Stage 3 - Financial instruments that become credit-impaired with evidence of default, i.e. non-performing assets, are transferred to Stage 3. Please refer to Risk Management section for the definition of non-performing assets.\n\nLifetime ECL is recognised for these assets. ECL for Stage 3 assets are also known as specific allowances.\n\nA Stage 3 exposure that is restructured can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the obligor is able to service future principal and interest payments in accordance with the restructured terms. Stage 3 financial assets are written-off, in whole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery efforts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of future recoveries.\n\n## Measurement of ECL\n\nECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a financial instrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original effective interest rate to the reporting date.\n\n| Component   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD          | Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to  take into account estimates of future conditions that will  impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default.                                                             |\n| LGD         | Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the  difference between the contractual cash flows due and  those that the Group would expect to receive, including  recoveries from collaterals.                          |\n| EAD         | Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of  default, taking into account repayments of principal  and interest as well as expected drawdowns on  undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs on  guarantees issued. |\n\nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.\n\nIn most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk of the borrower. However, for some revolving products (e.g. credit cards), the expected remaining maturity may exceed the contractual maturity. In such instances, behavioural expected remaining life will be used.\n\n## ECL Modelling - Point-in-Time and Forward-Looking Adjustments\n\nThe Group leverages the models and parameters implemented under\n\nthe Basel II Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) framework where possible, with appropriate modifications to meet SFRS(I) 9 requirements.\n\nOther relevant historical information, loss experience or proxies will be utilised for portfolios without appropriate Basel models and parameters, with a view to maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable.\n\n|\n\nFor the wholesale portfolios, credit cycle indices (CCIs) have been developed for the key industries and geographies. CCIs are summary measures that depict broad-based, sector-wide changes in credit risk, which are constructed by comparing the median expected default frequency of firms within each segment against a long-run average. Expected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of firms' assets, asset volatility and leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience.\n\nThe Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates.\n\nFor retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.\n\n## Expert credit judgement and post model adjustments\n\nThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 assignment of credit risk ratings and determination of whether exposures should be placed on credit watchlists;\n- \u00b7 assessment of whether a significant increase in credit risk has occurred;\n- \u00b7 selecting and calibrating the ECL models such as CCIs;\n- \u00b7 determining the expected remaining maturity of revolving products (e.g. overdrafts and credit cards);\n- \u00b7 determination of the forecast loss rates; and\n- \u00b7 application of thematic overlays based on emerging risk themes where potential risks may not be fully captured in the underlying modelled ECL. Such top-down additional modelled ECL was quantified by means of applying conditional probabilities on more severe scenarios materialising from emerging risk themes.\n\nThe Group has two thematic overlays as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn addition to the base scenarios generated by the model, the Group has incorporated a stress scenario and assigned probabilities to the scenarios, in line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario. The stress scenario assumes Covid-19 recovery being derailed by higher global inflation which triggers rate hikes and causes financial market dislocation.\n\nAn additional thematic overlay was introduced in 2021 to address pricing pressures and risks of asset stranding that the conventional energy sector could face as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy. Probabilities were assigned to the scenarios in-line with management's judgement of the likelihood of each scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Governance framework\n\nThe measurement of ECL is subject to a robust governance framework as described below.\n\n- \u00b7 The Group ECL Review Committee (Review Committee) is the overarching committee for ECL related matters and comprises senior management and representatives from functions across the Group. Significant changes to ECL models and methodologies and the application of thematic overlays are subject to the oversight and approval of the Review Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Review Committee is supported by the Group ECL Operating Committee (Operating Committee) which comprises cross functional representatives and subject matter experts. The Operating Committee recommends changes to ECL models, methodologies and thematic overlays to the Review Committee; provides oversight over system design, infrastructure and development; and establishes principles and significant policies pertaining to ECL. Group Credit Risk Models Committee oversees ECL models and credit risk models used by the Group.\n- \u00b7 Location ECL committees are established for key overseas subsidiaries to govern and manage location-specific ECL reporting.\n- \u00b7 ECL models are subject to independent validation by the Risk Management Group (RMG) as well as independent reviews by internal and external auditors. The validation and assurance processes cover the review of the underlying ECL methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness.\n\n## 2.12 Repurchase agreements\n\nRepurchase agreements (Repos) are arrangements where the Group sold the securities but are subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem the securities at a pre-determined price. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership and these securities are disclosed within 'Financial assets pledged or transferred' (Note 19). The consideration received is recorded as financial liabilities in either 'due to banks' or 'deposits and balances from customers'. Short-dated repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements (Reverse repos) are arrangements where the Group purchased the securities but are subject to a commitment to resell or return the securities at a pre-determined price. The risk and rewards of ownership of the collateral are not acquired by the Group and are reflected as collateral received and recorded offbalance sheet. The consideration paid is recorded as financial assets as 'cash and balances with central banks', 'due from banks' or 'loans and advances to customers'. Short-dated reverse repos transacted as part of Treasury Markets activities are measured at FVPL.\n\n## 2.13 Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from business combinations generally represents the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment.\n\nAt the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to benefit from the combination's synergies.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU's or CGU group's fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## 2.14 Properties and other fixed assets\n\n## Owned properties and other fixed assets\n\nProperties (including investment properties) and other fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.\n\nGenerally, the useful lives are as follows:\n\nLeasehold land\n\n100 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land where the unexpired lease period is more than 100 years is not depreciated.\n\nBuildings\n\n30 to 50 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter.\n\nComputer software\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nOffice equipment, furniture and fittings\n\n5 to 10 years\n\nLeasehold improvements\n\nUp to 20 years\n\n## Leased properties and other fixed assets\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date. The associated right-of-use assets are measured at the amount that approximates the lease liability.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nExtension options and termination options are included in the assessment of the lease term if the options are reasonably certain to be exercised or not exercised accordingly. If the Group changes its initial assessment, adjustments are made to the carrying amounts of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets prospectively.\n\nThe recognition exceptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are applied.\n\nPlease refer to Note 26 for the details of owned and leased properties and other fixed assets.\n\n## 2.15 Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition, classification and subsequent measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. The Group generally classifies and measures its financial liabilities in accordance with the purpose for which the financial liabilities are incurred and managed. Accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities at fair purpose of ongoing market-making or trading. Financial liabilities at fair\n- value through profit or loss if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term ( 'held for trading' ), and this may include debt securities issued and short positions in securities for the value through profit or loss can also be designated by management on initial recognition ( 'designated at fair value through profit or loss' ) if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces measurement or recognition inconsistencies that would otherwise arise, or if the financial liability contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise need to be separately recorded, or if a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis. Financial liabilities in\n\nthis classification are usually within the 'Treasury Markets' segment.",

        "page_content": "Realised or unrealised gains or losses on financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated under the fair value option, except interest expense, are taken to 'Net trading income' in the income statement in the period they arise.\n\nThe changes to the fair value of financial liabilities designated under the fair value option that are attributable to a reporting entity's own credit risk are taken to revenue reserves through other comprehensive income. These amounts are not transferred to the income statement even when realised.\n\n- \u00b7 Derivative liabilities are treated consistently with derivative assets. Please refer to Note 2.9 for the accounting policy on derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Other financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. These comprise predominantly the Group's 'Deposits and balances from customers', 'Due to banks' and 'Other debt securities'.\n\nWhere the classification and measurement of financial liabilities do not reflect the management of the financial liabilities, the Group may apply hedge accounting where permissible and relevant to better reflect the management of the financial liabilities. Please refer to Note 2.19 for details on hedging and hedge accounting.\n\nPlease refer to Note 14 for further details on the types of financial liabilities classified and measured as above.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of financial liabilities is the price that would be paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further fair value disclosures.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognised from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## 2.16 Loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees\n\n## Loan commitments\n\nLoan commitments are not recognised on the balance sheet and are disclosed in Note 35. Upon a loan draw-down, the amount of the loan is generally recognised as 'Loans and advances to customers' on the Group's balance sheet.\n\n## Letters of credit\n\nLetters of credit are recorded off-balance sheet as contingent liabilities upon issuance, and the corresponding payables to the beneficiaries and receivables from the applicants are recognised on the balance sheet upon acceptance of the underlying documents.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are initially recognised in the financial statements at fair value on the date the guarantees are given.\n\nFinancial guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the ECL (Note 2.11); and\n- \u00b7 the unamortised portion of the fees that were received on initial recognition.\n\n|\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.8 for the principles for recognising the fees.\n\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures are managed for credit risk in the same manner as financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 2.11 on the Group's accounting policies on allowances for credit losses.\n\n## 2.17 Provisions and other liabilities\n\nProvisions for other liabilities of uncertain timing and amounts are recognised when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- \u00b7 a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.18 Share capital and other instruments classified as equity\n\nOrdinary shares, preference shares and other instruments which do not result in the Group having a contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group, are classified as equity. Distributions arising from such instruments are recognised in equity as there is no contractual obligation to pay distributions on these instruments. Incremental external costs directly attributable to the issuance of such instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhen any entity within the Group purchases the Company's ordinary shares ('treasury shares'), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a component within equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\nWhen treasury shares are subsequently cancelled, the cost of the treasury shares is deducted against either the share capital account or retained earnings. When treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any realised gain or loss on sale or reissue, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and related income tax, is recognised in other reserves.\n\nFor ordinary and preference shares, interim dividends are recorded during the financial year in which they are declared payable. Final dividends are recorded during the financial year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.",

        "page_content": "## D) Other Specific Topics\n\n## 2.19 Hedging and hedge accounting\n\nAs part of the overall risk management of the Group, derivatives and other instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks, including exposures arising from forecast transactions.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is not applied, the derivatives are treated in the same way as derivatives held for trading purposes, i.e. realised and unrealised gains and losses are recognised in 'Net trading income'. The Group applies hedge accounting for economic hedge relationships that meet the hedge accounting criteria. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge transaction; and the methods used to assess the effectiveness of the hedge. At inception and on an on-going basis, the Group also assesses and measures the effectiveness of the hedging relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item.\n\nWhere all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between hedging instrument and the hedged item. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations as described below.\n\n## \u00b7 Fair value hedge\n\nFor a qualifying fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised, using the effective interest method, to the income statement over its remaining maturity.\n\nHowever, where the hedged item is an equity instrument classified as FVOCI, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the hedged item are both recorded in other comprehensive income and accumulated in FVOCI revaluation reserves. The amounts recorded in FVOCI revaluation reserves are not subsequently reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the cash flow hedge reserves in equity. This amount is reclassified to the income statement in the periods when the hedged forecast cash flows affect the income statement. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement under 'Net trading income'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in the cash flow hedge reserves remains until the forecast transaction is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in the cash flow hedge reserves is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## \u00b7 Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in the Group's foreign operations are accounted for in a manner similar to cash flow hedges. On disposal of the foreign operations, the cumulative gain or loss in the capital reserves is reclassified to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nWhen designating the hedging instrument, the Group may elect to exclude the valuation components of currency basis spreads and forward points from the hedge relationship on a hedge-by-hedge basis.\n\nThe forward points and currency basis spreads which are excluded and recorded in other comprehensive income are:\n\n- \u00b7 reclassified to the income statement when the forecast transaction occurs; or\n- \u00b7 amortised to the income statement over the hedging tenor for time-period hedges. The amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are not subsequently reclassified to the income statement for hedges of FVOCI equities.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the SFRS(I) 9 hedge accounting rules in full.\n\nPlease refer to Note 38 for further details relating to hedge accounting, including fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\n## 2.20 Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefits, which include base pay, cash bonuses, sharebased compensation, contribution to defined contribution plans such as the Central Provident Fund and other staff-related allowances, are recognised in the income statement when incurred.\n\nFor defined contribution plans, contributions are made to publicly or privately administered funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group has no further payment obligations.\n\nEmployee entitlement to annual leave is recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual unutilised leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.\n\n## 2.21 Share-based compensation\n\nEmployee benefits also include share-based compensation, namely the DBSH Share Plan, the DBSH Employee Share Plan and the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (the Plans). The details of the Plans are described in Note 39.\n\nEquity instruments granted and ultimately vested under the Plans are recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The expense is amortised over the vesting period of each award, with a corresponding adjustment to the share plan reserves.\n\nA trust has been set up for each share plan. The employee trust funds are consolidated and the DBSH shares held by the trust funds are accounted for as 'treasury shares', which is presented as a deduction within equity. The trust deeds for DBSH Share Plan and DBSH Employee Share Plan expired on 27 January 2021, following which the Company directly undertakes the administration of these Plans.",

        "page_content": "## 2.22 Current and deferred taxes\n\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised as the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nTax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are offset when a legal right of offset exists and settlement in this manner is intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account the likelihood the amount that can be used to offset payable taxes on future profits.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments, which are recognised outside profit or loss, is also recognised outside profit or loss, i.e. in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves.\n\n## 3. Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the financial statements. Certain accounting estimates require management's judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the Group's critical accounting estimates that involve management's valuation judgement.\n\n## 3.1 Impairment of financial assets\n\nIt is the Group's policy to recognise, through charges against profit, allowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.\n\nECLs are probability-weighted amounts determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions, which will necessarily involve the use of judgement.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic, related measures to control the spread of the virus and governmental support to mitigate the impact of the pandemic had a profound economic impact on the Group's key markets. A significant degree of judgement is thus required in estimating the ECLs in the current environment. Please refer to Note 2.11 for more details.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for a further description of the Group's credit risk management framework, policies and procedures.\n\n|\n\n## 3.2 Fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe majority of the Group's financial instruments reported at fair value are based on quoted and observable market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced or verified market parameters.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments without an observable market price in an active market may be determined using valuation models. The choice of model requires significant judgement for complex products especially those in the 'Treasury Markets' segment.\n\nPolicies and procedures have been established to facilitate the exercise of judgement in determining the risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash flows and other factors used in the valuation process.\n\nPlease refer to Note 41 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group's financial instruments measured at fair value.\n\n## 3.3 Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 27 provides details of goodwill at the reporting date.\n\nThe recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, in arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash flows, growth rate and discount rate.\n\n## 3.4 Income taxes\n\nThe Group has exposure to income taxes in several jurisdictions. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimate of whether additional tax will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group's tax position, appropriate provisions are provided based on the technical assessment of the cases. Where the final tax outcome of these positions is different from the provision provided, the differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax balances in the period in which the final tax is determined. Note 21 provides details of the Group's deferred tax assets/liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Sensitivity of ECL\n\nThe Group assessed ECL sensitivity for the wholesale and retail portfolios to changes in the allocation of exposures between Stages 1 and 2. ECL is estimated to reduce by $1,187 million (2020: $1,300 million) should all the exposures in Stage 2 return to Stage 1 and were assigned a lower 12-month ECL instead of lifetime ECL. The impact also reflects the higher PDs ascribed to Stage 2 exposures in addition to the recognition of lifetime instead of 12-month ECL.\n\nAs ECL estimation relies on multiple variables, no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensitivity of the ECL to changes in macroeconomic variables.\n\n## Relief measures offered to customers\n\nIn response to the impact of Covid-19, various forms of relief measures, such as payment deferments, had been offered to eligible retail and corporate customers. Payment deferments were considered to be non-substantial modifications and accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan agreements.\n\nIn line with regulatory guidelines, customers' utilisation of relief measures does not automatically result in significant increase in credit risk and a transfer to Stage 2. The assessment of customer's risk of default continues to be performed comprehensively, taking into account the customer's ability to make payments based on the rescheduled payments and their creditworthiness in the long term.\n\n## 12.

The credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all amounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an offset of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, as the legal right to offset the transactions is conditional upon default.\n\nThese agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement), global master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements are generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecation of collateral received and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.\n\nThe disclosures set out in the tables below pertain to financial assets and liabilities that are not offset in the Group's balance sheet but are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements that cover similar financial instruments. The disclosures enable the understanding of both the gross and net amounts, as well as provide additional information on how such credit risk is mitigated.\n\n|                               | The Group                   | The Group                       | The Group     | The Group                                    | The Group                                    | The Group     |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|\n|                               | Carrying                    | Not subject to                  |               | Related amounts not offset on  balance sheet | Related amounts not offset on  balance sheet |               |\n| In $ millions                 | amounts  on balance   sheet | enforceable  netting  agreement | Net   amounts | Financial  instruments                       | Financial collateral  received/ pledged      | Net   amounts |\n| 2021                          |                             |                                 |               |                                              |                                              |               |\n| Financial Assets              |                             |                                 |               |                                              |                                              |               |\n| Derivatives                   | 19,681                      | 4,656 (a)                       | 15,025        | 12,932 (a)                                   | 1,035                                        | 1,058         |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements | 29,466 (b)                  | -

        "page_content": "## 19. Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred\n\nThe Group pledges or transfers financial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group's financial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards. Among these, as set out below, are securities pledged or transferred pursuant to repurchase or securities lending or collateral swap agreements and for derivative transactions under credit support agreements.\n\nDerecognised assets that were subject to the Group's partial continuing involvement were not material in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Securities and Certificates of deposit\n\nSecurities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under terms in line with normal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to return them at maturity. If the securities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral.\n\nFor repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange is recorded as a financial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement operations. The fair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $4,488 million (2020: $5,184 million), which are recorded under 'Due to banks', 'Deposits and balances from customers' and 'Other liabilities' on the balance sheet.\n\nFor securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other financial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group also pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed.\n\n|                                                    | The Group   | The Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                      | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Financial assets pledged or transferred            |             |             |\n| Singapore Government securities and treasury bills | 2,092       | 1,360       |\n| Other government securities and treasury bills     | 4,327       | 8,642       |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                 | 1,407       | 3,305       |\n| Equity securities                                  | 42          | -           |\n| Certificates of deposit                            | 563         | 542         |\n| Total                                              | 8,431       | 13,849      |\n\n## Covered bonds\n\nPursuant to the Bank's Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to a bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd (see Notes 22.2 and 30.4). These residential mortgages continue to be recognised on the Bank's balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $5,689 million (2020: $4,545 million), while the carrying value of assets assigned was $9,237 million (2020: $11,498 million). The difference in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required to maintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nThe Group also enters into structured funding transactions where it retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows of financial assets extended to third parties but assumes a contractual obligation to pay these cash flows under the issued notes. The carrying amounts and fair values of these financial assets and liabilities both amounted to $25 million (2020: $350 million).",

In the normal course of business, the Group enters into transactions with these structured entities to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment opportunities.\n\nWhile the economic exposures may be the same as those to other type of entities, SFRS(I) 12 specifically requires companies to disclose such exposures arising from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities. The table below reflects exposures to third party securitisation structures where the Group holds an interest in the normal course of business.\n\nAs is the case with other types of counterparties, the carrying amount from transactions with unconsolidated structured entities have been included in the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe risks arising from such transactions are subject to the Group's risk management practices.\n\nThe table below represents the Group's maximum exposure to loss which for on-balance sheet assets and liabilities is represented by the carrying amount, and does not reflect mitigating effects from the availability of netting arrangements and financial instruments that the Group may utilise to economically hedge the risks inherent in third party structured entities, or risk-reducing effects of collateral or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                                 | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                   | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Derivatives                     | 6           | 142         |\n| Corporate securities            | 3,704       | 3,627       |\n| Loans and advances to customers | 9           | 14          |\n| Other assets                    | 2           | 3           |\n| Total assets                    | 3,721       | 3,786       |\n| Commitments                     | 549         | 306         |\n| Maximum exposure to loss        | 4,270       | 4,092       |\n| Derivatives                     | 108         | 10          |\n| Total liabilities               | 108         | 10          |\n\nSFRS(I) 12 also requires additional disclosures where the Group acts as a sponsor to unconsolidated structured entities. The Group is deemed a sponsor of a structured entity if it plays a key role in establishing the entity, and has an on-going involvement with the structured entity or if the Group's name appears in the structured entity's name.\n\nThere are certain investment funds where the Group is the fund manager and the investors have no or limited removal rights over the fund manager. These funds are primarily subscribed by the investors. As of 31 December 2021, the Group did not hold any investment in these investment funds. The table below summarises the Group's involvement in the funds.\n\n|                                                          |   The Group | The Group   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                            |        2021 | 2020        |\n| Total assets of the sponsored structured entities        |         452 | -           |\n| Fee income earned from the sponsored structured entities |           4 | -           |",

The scheme of amalgamation is under the special powers of the Government of India and Reserve Bank of India under Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, India. The amalgamation provides stability to LVB's depositors, customers and employees following a period of uncertainty. It complements the Group's digibank strategy with an expanded network of 600 branches and 1,000 ATMs, an additional two million retail and 125,000 non-retail customers, as well as a strengthened deposit franchise.\n\nThe provisional goodwill from amalgamation of LVB was finalised at $190 million (2020: $153 million) in November 2021, being the difference between the fair value of its assets and liabilities of $3.89 billion (2020: $3.89 billion) and $4.08 billion (2020: $4.04 billion) respectively. The $37 million increase reflects the increase in fair values of pension and gratuity liabilities as of the acquisition date based on the updated actuary report. As at 26 November 2020, total loans transferred amounted to $2.12 billion, including net non-performing loans of $212 million and total deposits transferred amounted to $3.60 billion.\n\n## 25.2  Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Limited\n\nThe Group announced on 20 April 2021 that it had entered into an agreement and have obtained approvals from Monetary Authority of Singapore and China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, Shenzhen Office to subscribe for a 13% stake in Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Limited ('SZRCB') for CNY5.3 billion ($1.1 billion) ('the Investment').The purchase consideration was adjusted to CNY5.2 billion ($1.1 billion) following the dividend distribution of CNY10 cents per share by SZRCB in May 2021.\n\nThe Investment is classified as an associate and applies the equity method of accounting. The Group is able to exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policy decision through board representation.\n\nThe transaction was completed in October 2021 and a gain of $104 million was recognised, being the excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of investment. The gain is included in share of profits or losses of associates during the year. The Investment is in line with the Group's strategy of investing in its core markets and accelerates its expansion in the rapidly growing Greater Bay Area.\n\n## 26.

Goodwill and Intangibles\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's goodwill and intangibles arising from business acquisitions are as follows:\n\n|                              | The Group   | The Group   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                | 2021        | 2020        |\n| DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited | 4,631       | 4,631       |\n| Others (a)                   | 731         | 692         |\n| Total                        | 5,362       | 5,323       |\n\n## (a) 2021 includes goodwill relating to LVB of $192 million (2020: $153 million) following the amalgamation with DBS Bank India Limited\n\nThe carrying amounts of the CGUs are reviewed at least once a year to determine if the goodwill associated with them should be impaired. If a CGU's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe recoverable value is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU's five-year projected free cash flows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy requirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capital to derive its present value. To derive the value beyond the fifth year, a long-term growth rate is imputed to the fifth-year cash flow and then discounted by the cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate used does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of the market the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum of the present value of the five-year cash flows and the terminal value.\n\nA growth rate of 3.5% (2020: 3.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2020: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited's franchise.\n\nThe process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash flows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by applying a reasonably possible change to those assumptions. The reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an impairment of goodwill at 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 36. Financial Derivatives\n\nFinancial derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from the underlying assets, or from interest and exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The following sections outline the nature and terms of the most common types of derivatives used by the Group.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nForward rate agreements give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). There is no exchange of principal and settlement is effected on the settlement date. The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date.\n\nInterest rate swaps involve the exchange of interest obligations with a counterparty for a specified period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.\n\nInterest rate futures are exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard amount of a specified fixed income security or time deposit at an agreed interest rate on a standard future date.\n\nInterest rate options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future deposit or loan, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date.\n\nInterest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest. There is no facility to deposit or draw down funds, instead the writer pays to the buyer the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the floor rate respectively. This category includes combinations of interest rate caps and floors, which are known as interest rate collars.\n\n## Foreign exchange derivatives\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on a specified future date.\n\nCross currency swaps are agreements to exchange, and on termination of the swap, re-exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies. Cross currency swaps may involve the exchange of interest payments in one specified currency for interest payments in another specified currency for a specified period.\n\nCurrency options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date.\n\n## Equity derivatives\n\nEquity options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.\n\nEquity swaps involve the exchange of a set of payments whereby one of these payments is based on an equity-linked return while the other is typically based on an interest reference rate.\n\n|\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit default swaps involve the transfer of credit risk of a reference asset from the protection buyer to the protection seller. The protection buyer makes one or more payments to the seller in exchange for an undertaking by the seller to make a payment to the buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nCommodity contracts are agreements between two parties to exchange cash flows which are dependent on the price of the underlying physical assets.\n\nCommodity futures are exchange-traded agreements to buy or sell a standard amount of a commodity at an agreed price on a standard future date.\n\nCommodity options give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount of commodity at an agreed contract price on or before a specified date.\n\n## 36.1 Trading derivatives\n\nMost of the Group's derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally for dealer's margin or for the purpose of generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price.\n\nTrading includes mainly market-making and warehousing to facilitate customer orders. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the intention of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Warehousing involves holding on to positions in order to liquidate in an orderly fashion with timing of unwinding determined by market conditions and traders' views of markets as they evolve.\n\n## 36.2 Hedging derivatives\n\nThe accounting treatment of the hedge derivative transactions varies according to the nature of the hedge and whether the hedge meets the specified criteria to qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives transacted as economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting are treated in the same way as derivative instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nPlease refer to Note 38 for more details on derivatives used for hedging.",

They do not represent amounts at risk.\n\nIn the financial statements, trading derivative financial instruments are revalued on a gross position basis and the unrealised gains or losses are reflected as derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivative assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are only offset if the transactions are done with the same counterparty, a legal right of offset exists, and the parties intend to settle the cash flows on a net basis. There were no offset of derivative assets and liabilities in 2021 and 2020.\n\n|                                                                                                         |            |

        "page_content": "## 37. Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIn March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the dates on which LIBOR would be discontinued. All GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) settings and the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 31 December 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 30 June 2023. In Singapore, as announced by the Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) on 31 March 2021, Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR), which relies on USD LIBOR in its computation, would similarly be discontinued immediately after 30 June 2023 across all settings. The Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) would discontinue by end-2024, with 6-month SIBOR being discontinued immediately after 31 March 2022.\n\nThe Group's main interest rate benchmark exposures are USD LIBOR, SOR and SIBOR. USD LIBOR will be replaced by USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) while the replacement benchmark rate for SOR and SIBOR is Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).\n\n## Changes in contractual cash flows of financial instruments\n\nAs described in Note 2.3, the Group adopted 'Phase 2' amendments on 1 January 2021. The 'Phase 2' amendments provide practical expedients that require changes in the contractual cash flows of financial instruments that result solely from IBOR reform and are economically equivalent to be accounted for by updating the effective interest rate, rather than recognising an immediate gain or loss in the income statement.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe SFRS(I) 9 requirements in respect of hedge accounting were amended in two phases. The first set of amendments ('Phase 1' amendments), which was adopted by the Group in 2020, provided temporary exceptions that allowed the continuation of hedge accounting for existing hedge relationships under the assumption that IBOR-based hedged cash flows are not altered as a result of uncertainty arising from IBOR reform. The uncertainty ends when the key terms of transition have been finalised i.e. the timing of the transition and adjustment spreads between an IBOR and its ARR have been finalised for affected contracts. As at 31 December 2021, the Group continues to apply these temporary exceptions for USD and SGD denominated hedging relationships.\n\nThe key assumption made when performing hedge accounting is that both the hedged item and hedging instrument will be amended from existing IBORs to new ARRs at the same time. Where actual differences between those dates arise, hedge ineffectiveness will be recorded in the income statement.\n\nSignificant judgement is also required to determine when uncertainty arising from IBOR reform ends and, hence, 'Phase 1' amendments cease to apply. Thereafter, 'Phase 2' amendments, adopted by the Group, require the Group to continue hedge accounting when changes to the hedging instrument, hedged item and hedged risk arise solely from IBOR reform. Hedge ineffectiveness (e.g. arising from mismatches of timing, or cash flows) continue to be recorded in the income statement.\n\n|\n\n## How the Group is managing the transition to ARRs\n\nA Group steering committee was established in 2019 to manage the impact of IBOR reform on the Group. The committee comprises senior representatives from Institutional Banking Group, Consumer Banking Group, Treasury Markets, Finance, Risk Management Group, Technology & Operations, Legal and Compliance and Group Strategic Marketing and Communications and is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer. The Terms of Reference of the committee are to review transition plans related to LIBOR and SOR discontinuation, SIBOR reform and other interest rate benchmark reform, to assess the Group's key risks across different scenarios, and to develop strategies to manage existing and new business in the context of these risks. Oversight of IBOR reform is provided by the Group Executive Committee and the Board Risk Management Committee.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, changes required to systems, processes and models have been identified and have been substantially implemented. Substantially all contracts with interest rates that are pegged to GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY LIBOR or one-week and two-month tenors for USD LIBOR have been remediated. For contracts referencing SOR, SIBOR or the remaining USD LIBOR settings, the Group has begun its communication with relevant counterparties and contract remediation is ongoing.\n\nThe Group has identified that the risks arising from IBOR reform are:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk of contractual disputes arising from the lack of legal clauses catering for the discontinuation of an interest rate benchmark, and its replacement with an ARR, or such clauses failing to operate as expected; and\n- \u00b7 Risk of reputational harm due to poor customer management related to interest rate benchmark discontinuation, leading to loss of customer business.\n\nThese risks are mitigated through robust oversight by the Group steering committee. The Group will continue to identify and assess risks associated with IBOR reform.",

Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group enters into hedging transactions to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. Hedge accounting is applied to minimise volatility in earnings arising from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates.\n\nPlease refer to Risk Management section for more information on market risk and the Group's risk management practices and Note 2.19 for the Group's accounting policy for hedge accounting.\n\n## 38.1 Fair value hedge\n\nIn accordance with the risk management strategy in place, the Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 issued fixed rate debt;\n- \u00b7 a portion of purchased fixed rate bonds; and\n- \u00b7 some large exposures to corporate loans.\n\nIn such instances, the Group hedges the benchmark interest rate risk component which is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk. Specifically, the Group has designated fair value hedge relationships, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to hedge against movements in the benchmark interest rate. This effectively results in the recognition of interest expense (for fixed rate liabilities), or interest income (for fixed rate assets) at floating rates. The Group also uses cross currency swaps when there is a need to hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nThe Group manages all other risks arising from these exposures, such as credit risk, but hedge accounting is not applied for those risks.\n\nThe Group assesses prospective hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of the hedged item resulting from movements in the benchmark interest rate with the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps used to hedge the exposure. The Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivative with the principal of the debt issued or the bond asset purchased, or the loan granted.\n\nFor all interest rate swaps used for hedging purposes, critical terms match or nearly match those of the underlying hedged items.\n\nThe Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 the use of different discounting curves when measuring the fair value of the hedged items and hedging instruments. For derivatives the discounting curve used depends on collateralisation and the type of collateral used; and\n- \u00b7 difference in the timing of settlement of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nNo other significant sources of ineffectiveness were identified in these hedge relationships.\n\nThe Group typically uses foreign currency denominated borrowings/ deposits to fund its investments in non-SGD denominated FVOCI equity instruments. To reduce the accounting mismatch on the borrowings/ deposits and FVOCI equity instruments because of foreign exchange rate movements, the Group designates the borrowings/ deposits as the hedging instruments in fair value hedges of the FVOCI equity instruments. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the principal of the borrowings/ deposits with the investment costs of the FVOCI equity instruments. A potential source of ineffectiveness is a decrease in the fair value of the equity instruments below their investment costs.",

        "page_content": "## 38.2 Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group is predominantly exposed to variability in future cash flows due to interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations from the following:\n\n- \u00b7 assets subject to repricing, reinvestment or refinancing risk;\n- \u00b7 forecasted interest earnings denominated in foreign currency;\n- \u00b7 issued floating or fixed rate foreign currency debt; and\n- \u00b7 a portion of purchased floating or fixed rate foreign currency bonds.\n\nIn accordance with the Group risk management strategy, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, forward contracts or cross currency swaps to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in interest rates and/ or foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIn such instances, cash flow hedge relationships are designated. These are applied on a hedge-by-hedge basis, except for cash flows from assets subject to repricing, reinvestment or refinancing risk, for which a portfolio cash flow hedge relationship is designated using interest rate swaps. A dynamic process is applied for this hedge as the portfolio composition can change e.g. due to maturities and new originations. The portfolio cash flow hedge relationships effectively extend the duration of the assets, such that the interest cash flows are transformed from a floating rate basis to a fixed rate basis.\n\nThe Group enters into forward contracts to hedge against variability in future cash flows arising from USD-denominated interest income.\n\nThe Group also enters into cross currency swaps to mitigate the risk of fluctuation of coupon and principal cash flows due to changes in foreign currency rates of issued foreign currency debt and a portion of purchased foreign currency bonds. Critical terms of the cross-currency swaps match or nearly match that of the issued foreign currency debt or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group manages all other risks derived by these exposures, such as credit risk, but they do not apply hedge accounting for these risks.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative reflecting the terms of the hedged item due to movements in the hedged risk with the changes in fair value of the derivatives used to hedge the exposure.\n\nThe Group determines the hedge ratio by comparing the notional of the derivatives with the assets subject to repricing/ reinvestment/ refinancing risk or amount of forecast earnings denominated in foreign currency or the principal of the debt securities issued or purchased foreign currency bonds.\n\nThe Group has identified the following possible sources of ineffectiveness in its cash flow hedge relationships:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of derivatives as a protection against currency and interest rate risk creates an exposure to the derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is minimised by entering into derivatives with high credit quality counterparties;\n- \u00b7 difference in tenor of hedged items and hedging instruments;\n- \u00b7 difference in timing of settlement of the hedging instrument and hedged item; and\n- \u00b7 designation of off-market hedging instruments.\n\nThe following table sets out the maturity profile of the hedging instruments used in cash flow hedges. The amounts shown in the table reflect the notional amounts of derivatives.

The Group regularly reviews its hedging strategy, taking into account the long-term outlook of currency fundamentals and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on capital adequacy ratios.\n\nThe table below analyses the currency exposure of the Group by functional currency.\n\nThe Group\n\n| In $ millions    | Net  investments  in foreign  operations (a)   | Financial  instruments  which hedge  the net  investments   | Remaining  unhedged  currency  exposures   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 2021             |                                                |                                                             |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 9,934                                          | 2,298                                                       | 7,636                                      |\n| US dollar        | 9,829                                          | 6,150                                                       | 3,679                                      |\n| Chinese yuan     | 4,424                                          | 296                                                         | 4,128                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 2,190                                          | 684                                                         | 1,506                                      |\n| Others           | 4,276                                          | -                                                           | 4,276                                      |\n| Total            | 30,653                                         | 9,428                                                       | 21,225                                     |\n| 2020             |                                                |                                                             |                                            |\n| Hong Kong dollar | 11,772                                         | 2,261                                                       | 9,511                                      |\n| US dollar        | 2,990                                          | -                                                           | 2,990                                      |\n| Chinese yuan     | 2,730                                          | 283                                                         | 2,447                                      |\n| Taiwan dollar    | 2,046                                          | 376                                                         | 1,670                                      |\n| Others           | 4,011                                          | -                                                           | 4,011                                      |\n| Total            | 23,549                                         | 2,920                                                       | 20,629                                     |\n\nPlease refer to Note 34 for information on the capital reserves.

Share-based Compensation Plans\n\nAs part of the Group's remuneration policy, the Group provides various share-based compensation plans to foster a culture that aligns employees' interests with shareholders', enable employees to share in the Bank's performance and enhance talent retention.\n\n| Main Scheme/ Plan                                                                                                                          | Note   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| DBSH Share Plan (Share Plan)                                                                                                               |        |\n| \u00b7  The Share Plan is granted to Group executives as determined by the Committee appointed to administer the Share  Plan from time to time. | 39.1   |\n\n- \u00b7 Participants are awarded shares of the Company or, at the Committee's discretion, their equivalent cash value or a combination.\n- \u00b7 Awards consist of main award and retention award (20%/ 15% of main award) for employees on bonus/ sales incentive plans respectively. Dividends on unvested shares do not accrue to employees.\n- \u00b7 For employees on bonus plan, the main award vests from 2 to 4 years after grant i.e. 33% will vest 2 years after grant; another 33% will vest on the third year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 4 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 For employees on sales incentive plans, the main award vests from 1 to 3 years after grant; i.e. 33% will vest 1 year after grant, another 33% will vest on the second year and the remaining 34% plus the retention award will vest 3 years after grant.\n- \u00b7 There are no additional retention awards for shares granted to top performers and key employees as part of talent retention.\n- \u00b7 The awards will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n- \u00b7 The market price of shares on the grant date is used to estimate the fair value of the shares awarded. The fair value of the shares granted includes an adjustment to exclude the present value of future expected dividends to be paid during the vesting period.\n- \u00b7 Vested and unvested shares are subject to clawback/ malus. Conditions that trigger such clawback/ malus are in the Remuneration Report section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Shares are awarded to non-executive directors as part of director's remuneration. Details of these awards are disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Plan (ESP)\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee has ceased granting shares under the ESP effective from financial year 2018 remuneration. Shares granted from prior years continue to be outstanding until the shares are fully vested.\n\n## DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)\n\n- \u00b7 The ESPP was implemented in 2019 in selective markets across the Group. All permanent employees who hold the rank of Vice President and below are eligible to participate in the scheme.\n- \u00b7 The ESPP is a share ownership plan for eligible employees to own DBSH shares through monthly contributions via deductions from payroll or designated bank accounts.\n- \u00b7 Participants contribute up to 10% of month salary (minimum S$50, capped at S$1,000) and the Group will match 25% of the participant's contributions to buy DBSH ordinary shares for a period of 12 months during each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares bought from the Group's contribution will vest 24 months after the last contribution month for each plan year.\n- \u00b7 The matching shares will lapse immediately upon termination of employment, except in the event of ill health, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or death.\n\n39.1\n\n39.2",

        "page_content": "## 41. Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\n## 41.1 Valuation Process\n\nThe valuation processes within the Group are governed by the Valuation Policy, which is approved by the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Valuation Policy applies to all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, covering both market prices as well as model inputs. Financial assets and liabilities are marked directly using reliable and independent quoted market prices where available or by using reliable and independent market parameters (as model inputs) in conjunction with a valuation model.\n\nValuation models go through an assurance process carried out by the Risk Management Group (RMG), independent of the model developers. This assurance process covers the review of the underlying methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness together with the model inputs and outputs. Model assurances are conducted prior to implementation and subject to regular review or when there are significant changes arising from market or portfolio changes. Where necessary, the Group also imposes model reserves and other adjustments in determining fair value. Models are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee.\n\nA process of independent price verification (IPV) is in place to establish the accuracy of the market parameters used when the marking is performed by the Front Office. The IPV process entails independent checks to compare traders' marks to independent sources such as broker/ dealer quotes or market consensus providers.\n\nWhere market parameters are sourced independently for the marking of financial assets and liabilities, or used as inputs into a valuation model, these are checked for reliability and accuracy, for example by reviewing large daily movements or by referencing other similar sources, or transactions.\n\nValuation adjustments and reserves are taken to account for closeout costs, model and market parameter uncertainty, and any other factor that may affect valuations. Valuation adjustment and reserve methodologies are approved by the Group Market and Liquidity Risk Committee and governed by the Valuation Policy.\n\nThe valuation adjustments and reserves include but are not limited to:\n\n## Model and Parameter Uncertainty Adjustments\n\nValuation uncertainties may occur during fair value measurement either due to uncertainties in the required input parameters or uncertainties in the modelling methods used in the valuation process. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to take these factors into account.\n\nFor example, where market data such as prices or rates for an instrument are no longer observable after an extended period of time, these inputs used to value the financial instruments may no longer be relevant in the current market conditions. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to address the pricing uncertainty arising from the use of stale market data inputs.\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustments\n\nCredit valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk. Credit valuation adjustments are based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparties, magnitude of the current or potential exposure on the underlying transactions, netting and collateral arrangements, and the maturity of the underlying transactions.\n\n## Funding Valuation Adjustments\n\nFunding valuation adjustments represent an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make in incorporating funding costs and benefits that arise in relation to uncollateralised derivatives positions.\n\n## Day 1 Profit or Loss (P&L) Reserve\n\nIn situations where the market for an instrument is not active and its fair value is established using a valuation model based on significant unobservable market parameters, the Day 1 P&L arising from the difference in transacted price and end-of-day model valuation is set aside as reserves. A market parameter is defined as being significant when its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction. At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.\n\n## Bid-Offer Adjustments\n\nThe Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or short positions in financial instruments which are valued using mid-market levels. Bid-offer adjustments are then made to account for close-out costs.\n\n## IBOR Transition Related Reserves\n\nFixings for most of the major currency IBORs would fall back to the respective Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) plus a spread. Spread derivation details have been made known for most currencies. Valuation reserves have been set aside where derivation details are not known, and this leads to uncertainty in the forward rate estimation curves used for valuations.\n\n## 41.2 Fair Value Hierarchy\n\nThe fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each financial instrument is categorised in accordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is significant to the entire measurement. If unobservable inputs are deemed significant, the financial instrument will be categorised as Level 3.\n\nFinancial instruments that are valued using quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These would include government and sovereign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classified as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n\nWhere fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classified as Level 2. In cases where quoted prices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group's OTC derivatives.\n\nThe Group classifies financial instruments as Level 3 when there is\n\nreliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a financial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, attributing to a significant contribution to the instrument value. These would include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads).",

        "page_content": "## 41.3 Own credit adjustments on financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss related to the Group's own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income. As the Group does not hedge changes in own credit risk arising from financial liabilities, presenting the own credit movements within other comprehensive income does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income statement.\n\nThe change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk has been determined as the amount of change in fair value that is attributable to changes in funding spreads above benchmark interest rates. Fair value changes arising from factors other than the Group's own credit risk are insignificant.\n\nThe cumulative amounts attributable to changes in own credit risk for these financial liabilities as at 31 December 2021 was a loss of $49 million (2020: loss of $25 million).\n\nRealised losses attributable to changes in own credit risk as at 31 December 2021 was a loss of $22 million (2020: loss of $15 million).\n\n## 41.4 Financial assets & liabilities not carried at fair value\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value in the financial statements, the Group has ascertained that their fair values were not materially different from their carrying amounts at year-end.\n\nFor cash and balances with central banks, due from banks, loans and advances to customers, as well as due to banks and deposits and balances from customers, the basis of arriving at fair values is by discounting cash flows using the relevant market interest rates for the respective currencies.\n\nFor investment debt securities, subordinated term debts and other debts issued, fair values are determined based on independent market quotes, where available. Where market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe fair value of variable interest-bearing as well as short-term financial instruments accounted for at amortised cost is assumed to be approximated by their carrying amounts.",

Credit Risk\n\n## 42.1 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n\nThe following table shows the exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, before taking into account any collateral held, other credit enhancements and netting arrangements. For on-balance sheet financial assets, the maximum credit exposure is the carrying amounts. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon. For undrawn facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.\n\n|                                                               | The Group   | The Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| In $ millions                                                 | 2021        | 2020        |\n| On-balance sheet                                              |             |             |\n| Cash and balances with central banks (excluding cash on hand) | 54,237      | 48,207      |\n| Government securities and treasury bills                      | 53,262      | 51,700      |\n| Due from banks                                                | 51,377      | 50,867      |\n| Derivatives                                                   | 19,681      | 31,108      |\n| Bank and corporate debt securities                            | 53,788      | 54,109      |\n| Loans and advances to customers                               | 408,993     | 371,171     |\n| Other assets (excluding deferred tax assets)                  | 15,268      | 18,871      |\n|                                                               | 656,606     | 626,033     |\n\n## Off-balance sheet\n\nContingent liabilities and commitments (excluding capital commitments)\n\n366,031\n\n336,151\n\nTotal\n\n1,022,637\n\n962,184\n\nThe Group's exposures to credit risk, measured using the expected gross credit exposures that will arise upon a default of the end obligor are as shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). These exposures, which include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, are shown without taking into account any collateral held or netting arrangements.\n\n## Analysis of Collateral\n\nWhilst the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of off-balance sheet instruments, the amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to offsetting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Group's exposure.\n\nThe description of collateral for each class of financial asset is set out below.\n\n## Balances with central banks, Government securities and treasury bills, Due from banks and Bank and corporate debt securities Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivative transactions. Please refer to Note 36 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).\n\n## Loans and advances to customers, Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\nCertain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a sub-set of the Specialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets financed.\n\nThe extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of the requisite regulatory haircuts, is shown in the Group's Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangements entered by the Group as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants. As a result, certain collateral arrangements which do not meet its criteria will not be included. Certain collateral types which are not permitted as credit risk mitigants for credit exposures under the Standardised Approach are also excluded.\n\n|",

Capital Management\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's capital management objective, which is to maintain a strong capital position consistent with regulatory requirements under the MAS Notice 637 and the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers, investors and rating agencies. The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration the Group's strategic plans and risk appetite.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial Officer chairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on the Group's current and projected capital positions. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which the Group assesses its forecast capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and internal capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of differing scope and severity.\n\nThe Group is subject to and has complied with the capital adequacy requirements set out in the MAS Notice 637, which effects the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's capital adequacy framework in Singapore, throughout the year. The Group's capital adequacy ratios as at 31 December 2021 and 2020 have been subject to an external limited assurance review, pursuant to the MAS Notice 609 'Auditor's Report and Additional Information to be submitted with Annual Accounts'.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/default.page).\n\n|",

Segment Reporting\n\n## 45.1 Business segment reporting\n\nThe business segment results are prepared based on the Group's internal management reporting which reflects the organisation's management structure. As the activities of the Group are highly integrated, internal allocation has been made in preparing the segment information. Amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Group's various business segments are described below.\n\n## Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management\n\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management provides individual customers with a diverse range of banking and related financial services. The products and services available to customers include current and savings accounts, fixed deposits, loans and home finance, cards, payments, investment and insurance products.\n\n## Institutional Banking\n\nInstitutional Banking provides financial services and products to institutional clients including bank and non-bank financial institutions, governmentlinked companies, large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. The business focuses on broadening and deepening customer relationships. Products and services comprise the full range of credit facilities from short-term working capital financing to specialised lending. It also provides global transactional services such as cash management, trade finance and securities and fiduciary services, treasury and markets products, corporate finance and advisory banking as well as capital markets solutions.\n\n## Treasury Markets\n\nTreasury Markets' activities primarily include structuring, market-making and trading across a broad range of treasury products.\n\nIncome from sale of treasury products offered to customers of Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking is not reflected in the Treasury Markets segment, but in the respective customer segments.\n\n## Others\n\nThe Others segment encompasses the results of corporate decisions that are not attributed to business segments as well as the contribution of LVB as its activities have not been aligned with the Group's segment definitions. It includes earnings on capital deployed into high quality assets, earnings from non-core asset sales and certain other head office items such as centrally raised allowances. DBS Vickers Securities is also included in this segment.",

Subsequent Events\n\n## 46.1 Acquisition of consumer banking business of Citigroup Inc in Taiwan\n\nThe Group announced on 28 January 2022 that it has agreed to acquire the consumer banking business of Citigroup Inc (Citi) in Taiwan (Citi Consumer Taiwan) via a transfer of assets and liabilities, and will pay Citi cash for the net assets of Citi Consumer Taiwan plus a premium of $956 million (TWD 19.8 billion). The acquisition is in line with the Group's strategy to scale up its investment and accelerates its expansion in Taiwan.\n\n## 46.2 Operational risk penalty for digital disruption\n\nOn 7 February 2022, an operational risk penalty associated with the digital disruption in November 2021 was imposed on the main subsidiary of the Company, DBS Bank Ltd ('the Bank'). MAS has required the Bank to apply a multiplier of 1.5 times to its risk-weighted assets for operational risk which translates to an additional $930 million in regulatory capital.\n\nThe additional capital requirement will be reviewed when MAS is satisfied that the Bank has addressed the identified shortcomings.",

Please refer to page 97 of the Capital Management and Planning section in the 2021 Annual Report for an explanation of DBSH's dividend policy.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 3: Non-executive Directors' remuneration for 2021\n\nResolution 3 is to approve the payment of an aggregate amount of SGD 4,266,264 as remuneration for the non-executive Directors of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2021 ('FY2021'). If approved, each of the non-executive Directors (with the exception of Ms Euleen Goh, Mr Andre Sekulic, Mrs Ow Foong Pheng and Mr Chng Kai Fong) will receive 70% of his or her Directors' fees in cash and 30% of his or her Directors' fees in the form of share awards granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan. The share awards will not be subject to a vesting period, but will be subject to a selling moratorium whereby each nonexecutive Director will be required to hold the\n\n|\n\nequivalent of one year's basic retainer for the duration of his or her tenure as a Director, and for one year after the date he or she steps down as a Director. The actual number of shares to be awarded will be determined by reference to the volume-weighted average price of a share on the SGX-ST over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding) the date of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance will be paid in cash. The Directors' fees for Ms Euleen Goh and Mr Andre Sekulic, both of whom retired from office by rotation at the 22 nd Annual General Meeting held on 30 March 2021 ('2021 AGM') and did not offer themselves for re-election, will be paid to them in cash. The Directors' fees for Mrs Ow Foong Pheng (who stepped down as a Director immediately following the conclusion of the 2021 AGM) and Mr Chng Kai Fong will be paid in cash to a government agency, the Directorship & Consultancy Appointments Council.\n\nAlthough the non-executive Directors' fee structure for FY2021 remains unchanged from that for the year ended 31 December 2020 ('FY2020'), the amount of non-executive Directors' remuneration for FY2021 is approximately 4% higher than that for FY2020. The higher remuneration for FY2021 is mainly attributable to the following reasons: (i) each of the Board Chairman and the non-executive Directors who were in office at the 2021 AGM received a lower basic retainer fee of SGD 90,000 for FY2020 (instead of the full SGD 100,000) as they had volunteered to take a 10% reduction in their FY2020 basic retainer fees in a show of solidarity with the nation and DBS' stakeholders during the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the Board Chairman received a lower Board Chairman's fee of SGD 1,305,000 for FY2020 (instead of the full SGD 1,450,000) as he had also volunteered to take an additional 10% reduction in his Board Chairman's fees; and (iii) higher attendance fees due to the increased number of Board and Board committee meetings held in FY2021 and the increased in-person attendance at such meetings in FY2021.\n\nPlease refer to pages 46, 47, 55 and 56 of the Corporate Governance Report in the 2021 Annual Report for more details on the non-executive Directors' remuneration for FY2021.\n\n## Ordinary Resolutions 5, 6 and 7: Re-election of Directors retiring under article 99\n\n- (a) Dr Bonghan Cho, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation and Management Development Committee and Nominating Committee, and will be considered independent.\n- (b) Mr Olivier Lim Tse Ghow, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as Chairman of the Board Risk Management Committee, and as a member of each of the Board Executive Committee and Nominating Committee, and will be considered independent. In addition, Mr Lim will remain as the Lead Independent Director.\n- (c) Mr Tham Sai Choy, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as Chairman of each of the Audit Committee and Nominating Committee, and as a member of each of the Board Risk Management Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, and will be considered independent.\n\n## Ordinary Resolutions 8 and 9: Re-election of Directors retiring under article 105\n\n- (a) Mr Chng Kai Fong, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Board Sustainability Committee. Mr Chng is considered non-independent of the substantial shareholder as he is a senior civil servant. Mr Chng is a non-executive Director and has no management or business relationships with the Company.\n- (b) Ms Judy Lee, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, will remain as a member of each of the Audit Committee, Board Risk Management Committee, Compensation and Management Development Committee and Board Sustainability Committee, and will be considered independent.\n\n## Special Business\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 10: DBSH Share Plan\n\nResolution 10 is to empower the Directors to offer and grant awards and to allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan, provided that (a) the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be issued under the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) is limited to 5% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time; and (b) the aggregate number of new ordinary shares under awards which may be granted pursuant to the DBSH Share Plan (including the California sub-plan to the DBSH Share Plan) from this Annual General Meeting to the next Annual General Meeting shall not exceed 1% of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time.",

In addition, the California Sub-Plan imposes additional restrictions on participants residing in California other than those contemplated under the DBSH Share Plan.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 12: Share Issue Mandate\n\nResolution 12 is to empower the Directors to issue shares of the Company and to make or grant instruments (such as warrants or debentures) convertible into shares, and to issue shares in pursuance of such instruments, up to a number not exceeding in total 50% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company, of which the number of shares that may be issued other than on a pro rata basis to shareholders must be less than 10% of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings).\n\nFor the purpose of determining the aggregate number of shares that may be issued, the percentage of issued shares shall be based on the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) of the Company at the time that Resolution 12 is passed, after adjusting for (a) new shares arising from the conversion or exercise of any convertible securities or share options or vesting of share awards which were issued and are outstanding or subsisting at the time that Resolution 12 is passed; and (b) any subsequent bonus issue, consolidation or subdivision of shares. As at 10 February 2022 (the 'Latest Practicable Date'), the Company had 19,275,518 treasury shares and no subsidiary holdings.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 13: DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme\n\nResolution 13 is to empower the Directors, should they choose to apply the DBSH Scrip Dividend Scheme (the 'Scheme') to a qualifying dividend, to issue such number of new ordinary shares of the Company as may be required to be issued pursuant to the Scheme to members who, in respect of a qualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of that qualifying dividend. If the Directors should decide to apply the Scheme to a qualifying dividend, the current intention is that no discount will be given for the scrip shares.\n\n## Ordinary Resolution 14: Renewal of the Share Purchase Mandate\n\nResolution 14 is to renew the mandate to allow the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire its issued ordinary shares, on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Resolution.\n\nThe Company may use its internal or external sources of funds or a combination of both to finance its purchase or acquisition of the ordinary shares of the Company ('Ordinary Shares'). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase or acquire its Ordinary Shares, and the impact on the Company's financial position, cannot be ascertained as at the date of this Notice as these will depend on whether the Ordinary Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits, the number of Ordinary Shares purchased or acquired and the price at which such Ordinary Shares were purchased or acquired.\n\nBased on the existing issued and paid-up Ordinary Shares as at the Latest Practicable Date and excluding any Ordinary Shares held in treasury, the purchase by the Company of 2% of its issued Ordinary Shares will result in the purchase or acquisition of 51,366,842 Ordinary Shares.\n\nAssuming that the Company purchases or acquires 51,366,842 Ordinary Shares at the Maximum Price, in the case of both market and off-market purchases, of SGD 38.16 for one Ordinary Share (being the price equivalent to 5% above the average closing prices of the Ordinary Shares traded on the SGX-ST over the last five market days on which transactions were recorded immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date), the maximum amount of funds required is approximately SGD 2.0 billion.\n\nThe financial effects of the purchase or acquisition of such Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the financial statements of the Group and the Company for the financial year ended 31 December\n\n2021 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 9 March 2022 (the 'Letter').\n\nPlease refer to the Letter for further details.",
