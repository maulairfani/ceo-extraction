When I joined BT Group at the end of 2021, I was often asked why I'd chosen to lead a company that, for all its impressive strengths, can feel like a procession of challenges.\n\nMy answer was that getting it right here matters. BT Group is central to the UK's economy, public services and security. And it's at the heart of family and professional life for millions of people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThat role is not a given right. As Philip describes in this report, we are now sharply focused on network investment and ever-better customer service. We're modernising both what we do and how we do it, aligned to the UK Government and Ofcom agenda of transforming the UK's digital infrastructure.\n\nThis is a uniquely complex task - which is my other reason for joining the group. It will take a number of years and resolute focus.\n\n## Building for the long term\n\nMuch of business, politics and media tend to run on shorter loops than jobs like this. But the truth is we are in the early stages of a mammoth and long-term transformation programme. Our task is not only to make sure BT Group evolves as a truly world class telecoms leader, but that it develops its role within the ever-shifting technology landscape.\n\nWe are up to speed - rolling out fibre faster and cheaper than ever and already reaching more than half the population with 5G. My focus is making sure we keep this momentum and stay the course. Better to do the job properly than pretend it's a quick win.\n\nThe past couple of years have seen the group prove its mettle, rising to the role of critical national telecommunications provider, keeping people working and families connected, and underpinning vital public services.\n\n## \u00a3229bn\n\nthe new networks we and others are building will yield a national productivity gain of around \u00a3229bn b",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nOur task is not only to make sure BT Group evolves as a truly world class telecoms leader, but that it develops its role within the ever-shifting technology landscape.'\n\nAs we build back from the economic damage of the pandemic and cope with inflation, supply chain constraints and shifting geopolitics, our role is vital for the country's future. BT Group is already responsible for generating \u00a31 in every \u00a375 produced in the UK economy\u00aa. The new networks we and others are building will yield a national productivity gain of around \u00a3229bn b .\n\nIt is those fibre and 5G networks that, rightly, take the headlines. But the challenges we face are much wider. Connecting places is a yardstick but it is connecting people that will yield a return on our once-in-a-generation investment. And while doing that we must strive for ever-better customer service, building trust and confidence in everything we do.\n\n## Building a modern BT Group\n\nOur digitisation agenda runs through the group. New platforms and services for businesses as well as individuals must be matched by a concerted drive for backroom efficiency. I have been highly impressed by our colleagues' expertise and dedication to this transition. It is of course a human as well as technical process. We will continue to develop our skills base, recruiting and training the brightest, whilst reskilling our colleagues to stay competitive.\n\nWe are digitising both BT Group and the services we offer, but we must leave no one behind. It's why our full fibre build of 25m homes will include access for\n\n- a guaranteed 6.2m rural homes. It's why we make sure connectivity is financially accessible to all through our social tariffs, and why we're supporting vulnerable customers by freezing those tariff prices in 2022.\n\nFor all our best efforts and intentions, we won't always get it right. We saw that this year with the move to digital voice services - where not enough caution on our part caused real anxiety to some of our most vulnerable customers.\n\nPausing that programme was the right thing to do to learn lessons and improve the experience for customers. But at the same time, we must keep leading the UK's digital transition, explaining both practical necessities and advantages to customers - like the value of digital telephony in tackling scam calls.\n\nThis year we published BT Group's Manifesto to capture how we'll grow our business in a responsible, inclusive and sustainable way, meeting our purpose to connect for good.\n\nIt sets bold goals for the social and environmental impact of our work (see page 32 ). As chairman, I am determined to make sure we use it not as an exercise in saying the right things but as a basis for action.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe first job for any incoming chairman is to judge whether the right strategy and management are in place. I am certain that Philip and his executive team have the vision and experience for the task.\n\nAs we look ahead to FY23 and beyond, my priority for the Board will be to bolster its skills, diversity and experience - taking into account group strategy, the\n\nopportunities and challenges facing us and succession (given the tenure of longer serving directors). The Nominations Committee is focused on finding nonexecutive directors with skills to boost the Board's technology and digital capabilities and transformation expertise.\n\nAt this year's AGM, we'll bid a fond and grateful farewell to Leena Nair. Leena has chaired our Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee with great impact and we will miss her. But we recognise that her new role as Global CEO of Chanel is highly demanding. Sara Weller will succeed her as chair of the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee .\n\nIn November Sir Jan du Plessis stepped down as chairman. I want to say a big personal thank you to Jan for his dedication to BT Group and for the support he gave me when handing over the role. It is thanks in no small part to his stewardship that I inherited the job of chairman of a business with such clear strategic direction.\n\nIn recent years BT Group's share price performance has demanded considerable patience from our investors. In the last 12 months it has performed much better. I'm confident that our Executive Committee now has the investment and transformation plans in place to deliver for shareholders, customers and other stakeholders.\n\nWe are well on our way but this is no quick task. It needs our investors' faith. We will repay that literally through reinstating the full year dividend at 7.7 pence per share, but also through open and consistent dialogue about our progress.\n\nI want to close by thanking the many colleagues who have given me such a warm welcome. This company has an immense task ahead of it. But it is built on a brilliant team - one I'm really pleased to be part of.\n\n## Adam Crozier\n\nChairman\n\n11 May 2022",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThis year BT Group again proved its resilience and ability to get on and deliver. Our operational performance was strong - and doubly impressive in the context of global economic challenges. Two factors underpin this.\n\nFirst, and above all: the continued dedication and hard work of around 100,000 colleagues across the company and around the world. On behalf of the Board and my executive team, I want to thank each and every one of them for their efforts during the year and unwavering support for our customers. Recognising that our people face an extraordinary inflationary environment, we have been determined to offer the best pay rises we can afford, awarding colleagues increases ranging from 2% to 8%, and with a particular focus on those on lower salaries.\n\nSecond, clarity and alignment across the entire organisation on our purpose - we connect for good - and delivery on our strategic framework: building the strongest foundations, creating standout customer experiences and leading the way to a bright, sustainable future. (See page 18 ) These are now evident in all activity across the business and we see this in our ever-improving customer satisfaction results.\n\nDespite the economic uncertainty, BT Group shares performed well; over the 12 months to 31 March 2022, and including the reinstated full year dividend of 7.7 pence per share, we will have achieved a total shareholder return of 22.7% compared to 16.1% for the FTSE 100.\n\nOf course, the turbulent global economy has made its presence felt in all walks of life. BT Group was not immune - as seen in our FY22 financial performance but despite an overall decline in revenue, savings from our transformation programmes and tight cost management delivered EBITDA growth of 2%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BT Group is delivering\n\nWe're sticking to our plan: we have stepped up our modernisation agenda as we strengthen, simplify and sharpen the group's focus; we are achieving record customer satisfaction scores across all our brands; and we continue to accelerate our next generation network build programmes.\n\nOpenreach is now almost 30% of the way through our full fibre broadband build, having passed 7.2m premises and building faster and cheaper than any other operator. On 31 March, we had almost 1.8m FTTP\u00aa end user connections from 42 different communications providers.\n\nFrom a standing start three years ago, EE's 5G network now covers more than 50% of the UK population, 12 months ahead of target. Building next generation networks is one thing but connecting customers to them is what counts. On that measure we are also performing really well: our 5G-ready b customer base now stands at 7.2m.\n\nOur next generation networks will underpin all future BT Group products and propositions. Our FTTP customer base in Consumer has grown to its largest ever level at 1.1m; Enterprise signed a deal with BAI Communications to deliver connectivity solutions for the London Underground; and in Global we are continuing to grow next generation services, including Eagle-i which predicts and prevents cyber attacks for corporate and public sector customers.\n\nBuilding a bright sustainable future for BT Group revolves around enabling our long-term growth and prosperity. Our Digital unit will be at the centre of this, with a dual-track role to cut back our reliance on complex, costly legacy systems and create new growth opportunities. Little over a year since its creation, the Digital team is radically simplifying our internal systems and processes, supported in part by AWS, and working with Google Cloud to accelerate our progress to becoming AI-led. A significant new agreement with Microsoft is helping us move in the direction of a platform business, and we have signed another deal with Distributed to enhance our access to the talent we need to deliver on our ambition.\n\nThe highly regulated nature of our business and the importance of connectivity and the other services we provide means we'll always be front of mind for a broad range of stakeholders. Delivering our plan is helping us continue to strengthen our relationships with key groups, including the UK Government and our regulator, Ofcom.\n\nWe have stepped up our modernisation agenda as we strengthen, simplify and sharpen the group's focus; We are achieving record customer satisfaction scores across all our brands; and we continue to accelerate our next generation network build programmes.'",

Alongside leading capability and expertise in managed services and security, and superior customer experiences, these solutions will support our business customers on their digital journeys.\n\nOpenreach will build the UK's largest full fibre network, get cost advantages from this scale and switch customers to the new platform as fast as possible. Openreach will also keep providing industry leading service and strengthen its relationship with all communications providers (CPs).\n\nAcross BT Group we'll fundamentally change what we do and how we work. We'll simplify our product portfolio, automate and digitise our operations and shut down legacy systems, processes and networks. This will cut costs, boost execution speed and ensure we can deliver better experiences for customers and colleagues.\n\nWe'll keep reviewing how we can strengthen our business portfolio through opportunities to own, sell or partner. We'll continue to optimise the way we allocate the cash flow generated from our operations, balancing the need to reinvest capital in the business, especially in next generation networks and solutions, with meeting our obligations to service our debt and pension fund while allowing us to pay a progressive dividend.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nOutstanding connectivity remains our beating heart. Building next generation networks will not just lay the foundations for the future economic prosperity of our customers and the whole of the UK. It will also be the bedrock for BT Group's future success, but this is only the start. As we grow the group into a digital platform-led business to ensure our lasting competitiveness, we'll deliver on five key priorities.\n\n1. EE will become our flagship brand for consumers, leading our approach to future innovation, convergence and services beyond connectivity. Eventually, this will help us win in households across the UK and build deeper customer relationships by giving them exceptional experiences.\n\n2. BT will be our flagship brand for Enterprise and Global under the new heading, BT Means Business. Enterprise and Global have a strong portfolio of next generation services and we will capitalise on these to drive market share in fastgrowing areas where we're under-indexed.\n\n- 3. Openreach has a strong and growing early customer connection rate of 25% to the new FTTP network. At such an early stage in this asset's life, it's an encouraging indicator of the long-term economic return we'll generate on this once-in-a-generation investment.\n\n4. Half-way through FY22 we achieved our \u00a31bn gross annualised cost savings target - 18 months ahead of schedule. This let us bring forward our \u00a32bn savings target by a year to FY24 and target further savings totalling \u00a32.5bn by end FY25.\n\n5. We're sharpening our focus to make sure we are adapting to the changing markets we operate in and funding the right assets and initiatives for growth. To that end, we have finalised the sports joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery to improve our content offering to customers, aligning our business with a new global content powerhouse. Separately, we have now extended our reciprocal channel supply deal with Sky into the next decade and, following successful trials, Openreach and Sky have signed an MOU allowing Sky engineers to complete home installations of full-fibre for their customers. These deals strengthen our strategic relationship with a key partner, mutually benefiting all of our customers.",

We will only succeed if we help solve some of the problems faced by the customers and societies we serve. To that end, we launched the BT Group Manifesto in December, setting out how we'll accelerate responsible, inclusive and sustainable growth over the next decade.\n\nCentral to this is making sure customers have the necessary skills for their own digital futures - whether that's helping parents help their children get online or ready themselves for a career in coding after school or university. Our target is to help 25m people improve their digital skills by the end of March 2026. We're already over half-way to achieving that goal.\n\nWe have also set out clear workforce diversity and inclusion targets which are stretching but we're determined to pursue them and champion an inclusive culture that celebrates our differences. In addition, we have brought forward our net zero target by 15 years - to 31 March 2031 for our own emissions and 31 March 2041 for supply chain and customer emissions. By embracing new technologies such as full fibre, 5G, cloud computing and IoT, we will help customers avoid 60m tonnes of carbon emissions by 2030.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nBT Group has emerged from the global pandemic a stronger organisation with a clear path to future success. Despite lower revenue in FY22, we've grown EBITDA, we are well on track to modernise and improve every aspect of our operations and our mid- to longer-term financial outlook is improving.\n\nThe majority of our revenue base is now inflation-linked and customers are on clear, predictable and transparent pricing plans. Annual data consumption has more than doubled in the last five years and with the once-in-a-generation network upgrades needed to support this, it's critical that our pricing structures are fit for purpose and can fund these investments. That said, in the current inflationary environment we know every penny counts for our customers - which is why we won't increase social tariff prices in 2022.\n\nIn FY23 we expect to deliver revenue growth and EBITDA of at least \u00a37.9bn. Looking further out, we have expanded our gross annualised cost savings target to \u00a32.5bn by FY25.\n\nAs we pass the peak of our fibre build and move towards an all-fibre, all-IP network, we expect an annual capex reduction of at least \u00a31bn and lower operating costs of \u00a3500m. From these two things alone, by the end of the decade we expect at least \u00a31.5bn higher normalised free cash flow compared to FY22. Our progressive dividend policy will be underpinned by these increased cash flows as we move to sustainable growth going forward.\n\nIt is thanks to shareholders' support that we are making big investments in the long-term future and prosperity of BT Group - on their behalf, and on behalf of customers and the whole of the UK.\n\nThe true strength of our business lies in our unwavering commitment to putting customers first. Building and maintaining their trust in us is the single most important thing we do; we will never take it for granted and we will always strive for better.\n\nPhilip Jansen\n\nChief Executive 11 May 2022",

In the UK, 5G and full fibre rollout is progressing at pace.\n\nThese new high capacity, high speed networks will support greater consumption of connectivity and new digital technologies. These technologies will open up new opportunities (like 5G private networks) and shape how customers interact with the digital world.\n\n## Digitalisation and the shift to cloud\n\nIn parallel to revolutions in access networks, other digital technologies like cloud computing, AI and machine learning continue to evolve. This is changing the way people live and work.\n\nBusinesses are continuing to digitise, with communication and collaboration tools, and with shifts to cloud.

In the UK fixed access wholesale market there's more investment from alternative network providers (altnets) as well as established players. Traditional telcos and new entrants in the consumer and enterprise connectivity markets continue to drive intense competition.\n\nAs connectivity and digital service markets more closely intertwine, we face a wider set of competitors including non-traditional digital and big tech players.\n\n## Caring about societal and environmental impacts\n\nToday consumers, enterprises and governments want to buy from, or work with, companies that show they care about society and the environment.\n\nCompanies that have a clear purpose, behave responsibly, offer solutions that help customers address these issues, and directly help tackle climate change, environmental challenges and inequality will benefit.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe past two years have seen unprecedented levels of economic uncertainty. The pandemic continues to disrupt economies across the world and geopolitical tensions add further uncertainty.

        "page_content": "## Regulatory update\n\nMuch of our commercial activity is regulated in recognition of our significant presence across a number of markets. As a result of this, we need to engage closely with several UK regulatory authorities but with Ofcom being our key focus. Over the past 12 months that engagement has touched upon some crucial issues for the UK telecommunications market in general and for BT Group in particular.\n\n## Government support for fibre\n\nGovernment has supported the sector to accelerate and cut the cost of network deployment, since this is essential technology that will deliver widespread economic and social benefits right across the UK. We believe there is still more the Government could do.\n\nThe current super-deduction for infrastructure investors has provided positive support to our fibre rollout, and we are arguing for it to be extended in some form, beyond the current end date of March 2023, to provide the right incentives for future, further investment.\n\nFurther investment could be encouraged by making business rates for fibre networks more fair and predictable. At the same time, 'barrier busting' measures to facilitate wayleaves negotiations, planning and access to buildings and land could also assist in accelerating full fibre rollout.\n\nThe Government is progressing with 'Project Gigabit' to support fibre deployment to the 'final 20%' where commercial build is unlikely. This is likely to be drawn out beyond current commercial build timescales - targeting nationwide gigabit connectivity by 2030.\n\nSome of the original planned \u00a35bn of funds are now being allocated. We are continuing to engage with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) and the Building Digital UK (BDUK) executive agency on the framework for procuring them, building on our extensive commercial programmes that are already delivering significant volumes of full fibre to rural communities.\n\n## Shared Rural Network (SRN)\n\nWe're making great strides extending 4G rural coverage through the SRN initiative. The SRN will extend coverage to 95% of the UK's geography by the middle of this decade, delivering better connectivity to local communities and businesses.\n\nWe've already improved coverage in over 800 areas since the start of the programme in March 2020. And in December 2021 we announced plans to boost coverage in another 1,500 locations by 2024.\n\n## All IP\n\nUK landlines will move from the legacy public switched telephone network (PSTN) to be IP-based by the end of 2025 - a key enabler for the UK's wider move to full fibre. We recognise that this is a sensitive project given the need to protect vulnerable customers and the UK's Critical National Infrastructure.\n\nThe scale and nature of this challenge has meant we have put in place a pause on the managed migration of our consumer customers whilst we seek to implement additional measures to protect vulnerable users. We will continue to engage closely with Government, Ofcom, industry and user groups to minimise any disruption for all customers.\n\n## Consumer fairness\n\nUK regulators rightly prioritise consumers' interests. We support this and want regulation which delivers better outcomes for all customers, while supporting the vulnerable ones. We've continued to work with Ofcom to show how we're sticking to their Fairness for Customers commitments we signed up to in June 2019. That includes:\n\n- \u00b7 supporting customers and helping them engage with the market\n- \u00b7 making sure services work like they should\n- \u00b7 making it quick and easy for customers to switch CPs\n- \u00b7 making sure everyone gets fair treatment.\n\nThis year we launched Home Essentials - a new tariff for financially vulnerable customers. It has wider eligibility and is easier to access than our previous social tariff.\n\nWe've also voluntarily improved our protections for customers who don't take a new deal when their contract ends. BT broadband customers get a lower capped price rise than before. And we've been moving more customers on to BT Halo - which means there is no change to what they pay when their contracts end.\n\nEE mobile handset customers out of contract for more than three months get a price discount from then on. When existing BT, EE and Plusnet broadband or mobile customers' contracts end, we offer them the same price as new customers if they choose to re-contract.\n\nVulnerable customers are offered regular account reviews to make sure they're on the best deal for their needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn April 2021, we voluntarily decided to approach to consumer fairness through the\n\nintroduce Board-level oversight on our BT Compliance Committee (see page 96 ).",

        "page_content": "## European Electronic Communications Code (EECC)\n\nIn October 2020, Ofcom launched new customer protections based on EECC rule changes. In line with Ofcom's recommended phases we implemented most in December 2021, with the rest following in June and the remainder in April 2023. The rules give customers enhanced rights. For example since December 2021 all mobile devices have been sold unlocked, and vulnerable customers with specific needs have had better access to information in a format they choose. From June 2022, before customers order anything they'll get an easy-to-read contract summary which will also be easy to compare to other providers and services.\n\nWhilst we agree with what the EECC rules are trying to achieve, we feel that some of them are really complicated. An example of this is the rule on the customer's ability to end any or all elements of bundled services contracts for any non-beneficial change made to any element of that bundle. To give this right to customers, our systems need to be able to recognise Ofcom's broad definition of 'linked contract' across any combination of our fixed and mobile services, even across brands. We'll keep working through our business and systems to comply with this from June 2022, while simultaneously planning how to minimise any unintended consequences.\n\nFollowing Ofcom's final decision in September 2021, we've been working with the rest of industry to design and implement One Touch Switching. This new 'gaining provider-led' process will help customers switch quickly and seamlessly, not only within the Openreach network, but also between different networks. The deadline is April 2023. This is extremely challenging as there's a lot of complex cross-industry work to be done. But we support Ofcom's proposals. They'll benefit both home and business customers.\n\n## Net neutrality\n\nOfcom has started a review of the net neutrality framework which requires internet service providers to treat all internet traffic on their networks equally. Ofcom will consider whether the rules are still fit for purpose, given market developments and how changes could support innovation while still protecting customers. Ofcom aims to publish its thinking later in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mobile strategy\n\nAs technologies develop markets change, but they must still deliver mobile services that work for consumers and businesses. So Ofcom is conducting a broad scope mobile strategy review of the next five to ten years. It will include mobile investment returns and how competition (including large tech companies) and the mobile value chain could change.\n\nIn parallel, DCMS has launched a 'Wireless Infrastructure Strategy' review with an initial call for evidence. It will explore UK wireless connectivity over the next decade - and whether current policy and regulation will support the investment and innovation needed.\n\nOfcom and DCMS' reviews come at a really important time. The UK has made a strong start to rolling out 5G. It was one of the world's first countries to launch commercial networks in 2019, led by EE.\n\nBut 5G is still in its infancy. New technologies and use cases will emerge in the coming years, transforming UK productivity and playing a critical role in the UK's plan to move to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWorld class connectivity will underpin this potential. That's why the Ofcom and DCMS reviews are so vital. They must make sure policy and regulation continue to support the market structures that will minimise risks and maximise opportunities for the UK.\n\n## Broadband universal service\n\nWe're committed to improving the UK's digital infrastructure, bringing the benefits of good connectivity to all parts of the country. According to Ofcom, superfast broadband is now available to 96% of UK premises, with full fibre broadband now available in 28% of premises.\n\nWhile our investment in faster and more reliable networks will continue to deliver connectivity for the vast majority of communities across the UK, some areas are unlikely to benefit from commercial rollout in the short term. In these areas, we are proud to act as a partner to Government in addressing the connectivity challenge. As the designated universal service provider for broadband, for example, we supply faster connections for those unable to get decent broadband if the cost of doing so is less than the threshold of \u00a33,400 set by Government.\n\nIn October 2020, Ofcom started an investigation into whether we were in compliance with our obligations as a broadband universal service provider. Following discussions with Ofcom, we subsequently introduced a new payment option for customers to share any additional costs of upgrading the network to ensure the costs of getting connected can be shared predictably and fairly. Ofcom closed the case in November 2021. More broadly, we continue to support the Government as it considers how to address the connectivity challenge for communities unable to benefit from the broadband universal service.",

To do that, we must invest in the best converged network, create a simpler, more efficient and more dynamic BT Group and build a culture where people can be their best.\n\n## The best converged network Market leader in full fibre\n\nThis year we expanded and accelerated our ambition to reach 25m premises with full fibre by December 2026. The target includes committing to build to 6.2m homes and businesses in hard-to-reach rural communities so they too can benefit from our next generation network.\n\nOur investment of approximately \u00a315bn in full fibre will support the UK's digital economy into the future. Thanks to our engineers and network partners that are using the latest innovations in tools and processes, we're rolling it out at low cost and at an unrivalled pace. In total we've now passed over 7m homes and businesses, including over 2m in rural areas. And every quarter our build rate improves - with the fourth quarter of FY22 being our best yet.\n\nRight now, our engineers are building to over 50,000 homes and businesses every week. That's nearly 300 an hour - faster than every other major fibre builder combined. And we're doing it at lower cost. Because of productivity improvements, earlier this year we announced our expected build cost per premises was \u00a350 (c. 15% on average) lower than we initially planned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCPs have signed up to the Equinox pricing deal on our full fibre platform\n\n42\n\n- a  EE consumer customers receiving or capable of receiving 5G network connection using one or both of a 5G-enabled handset and a 5G-enabled SIM.\n\nAlmost 1.8m customers are already connected to our full fibre network (up 96% on last year). Our Consumer unit leads in full fibre uptake, with over 1m total connections and 20,000 new full fibre connections every week.\n\nImportantly, 42 of our CP customers have already signed up to the Equinox pricing deal on our full fibre platform. And we continue to strengthen our CP relationships. For example, Sky's engineers can now connect their customers to our network directly.\n\n## Market leader in 5G\n\nWe were first to launch 5G in the UK in 2019 and we're rolling it out further and faster. Our 5G network is now available in hundreds of towns and cities across the UK, and we offer 5G in more places than any other network.\n\nThis year we announced our 5G rollout now reaches over half the UK population, five years ahead of the Government's ambition, and we're aiming to cover c. 90% of the UK geography by 2028. To support this, we are utilising the 700MHz and 3.7 GHz spectrum we bought in 2021. And we've been doing all of this while implementing the Government's directive to remove equipment from high-risk vendors in the network.\n\nThe new network will give customers faster speeds, more reliable service, and near-instant connectivity. Our 5G customer base keeps growing. We now have 7.2m 5G ready\u00aa customers, 120% more than a year ago.\n\nBy working with partners to harness the power of 5G we've achieved a number of firsts. We've travelled through rainforests via an EE 5G and BBC Green Planet augmented reality experience which went live in February. And with North Lanarkshire Council we created the UK's first 5G immersive classroom in Scotland.\n\nOverall EE's outstanding network continues to be recognised. This year we kept our RootMetrics #1 UK network status for the 8th consecutive year. We were also #1 overall, in voice, in data, and in crowd in London according to Umlaut.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enhanced network capabilities and broadest reach\n\nStarting with the core network, we're upgrading our technology to make our network intelligent, converged and virtualised. We've hit major milestones in our Mobile Cloud Core project this year as we move to a single converged IP network starting with a standalone 5G core.\n\nThis year we signed a partnership agreement with a major cloud provider to deploy an edge platform in our network. This will improve customers' connectivity by reducing latency, optimising data traffic, enhancing security and meeting data residency needs for applications hosted in the BT network edge.\n\nOur Adastral Park R&D facilities continue to push network boundaries. For example, this year, together with partners we ran a world first trial of Quantum Key Distribution (an ultra-secure communication method over hollow core fibre cables).\n\nWe want customers to be able to connect wherever they go. That's why our network coverage is the UK's broadest. Our mobile network reaches 99% of the UK's population and Openreach's fixed network reaches over 31m homes and businesses.",

These small cells boost capacity in high demand areas, allowing customers to benefit from download speeds up to 300Mbps.\n\nTo have the broadest reach we're not just building in towns and cities. With Government and operators, we're increasing EE's network ambition to grow rural coverage by 4,500 square miles. That's more than the Lake District, Snowdonia, Peak District, Dartmoor and Cairngorms National Parks combined.\n\nOn top of our fixed and mobile networks we provide the UK's most extensive public wi-fi network. It has more than 500 hotspots and extra coverage in cities through our digital street hubs. The latest versions of our street hubs include environmental monitoring, rapid mobile device charging, an emergency call button as well as free gigabit capable wi-fi.\n\nWe've also rolled out 4G in Glasgow's subway stations and have announced a partnership to provide mobile connectivity throughout the London Underground.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are also working to cover more hard-to-reach places with things like portable cells and low earth orbit satellites.

We're retiring old products to create a new streamlined portfolio of solutions that deliver brilliant experiences and serve our customers' future needs. We're also withdrawing products with outdated features, slow speeds and data caps to reduce the complexity of our business.\n\nIn the last 12 months we've made big progress. In line with our aim to close the PSTN network by December 2025, Openreach has started the process to stop selling legacy products to c. 5m premises across over 550 exchanges as of March 2022.\n\n52% of our legacy Global portfolio has been or is currently being withdrawn. And in Consumer we've halved the number of broadband propositions by cutting old promotional tiers.\n\n## Transformed customer journeys\n\nWe want the best customer engagement in our industry. So, we're redefining our digital journeys to be simple, omnichannel and with customer-led design. We're also automating our processes and using AI capabilities for better experiences.\n\nIn Consumer, we've automated c. 50% of the EE mobile journey in digital channels, reducing the amount of manual interventions.\n\nWe've simplified the EE website by cutting back the number of links in the online shop from 50 to less than 15. We've also improved EE's digital upgrade journey, boosting customer satisfaction and increasing order volume by 23%.\n\nBy transforming our Consumer customer journeys and call centre operations we've seen 14% fewer broadband customers and 5% fewer mobile customers needing to call us to fix an issue. This has reduced our service costs by 9% year on year.\n\nIn SME we have improved broadband acquisition journeys for small businesses. We've seen a 3.1pp increase in the digital channel share, a 53% increase in conversions, a \u00a315 higher average order value and 18% of orders wanting extra lines.",

For customers this means they can keep track of their costs and manage more aspects of their accounts quickly and efficiently online, without needing to contact an agent.\n\nIn Global, we have rolled out AI-based solutions across almost 700 customer queues. It's cut the effort needed to monitor and manage incidents where no fault is found by 45% - and freed our agents to spend more time on issues that really matter to customers.\n\nIn Openreach we have a new systemic treatment for repeat faults, helping a specialist team investigate and find permanent fixes. It's driven down the number of complex customer faults repeated three or more times by 50%. We've also put in a new automated scheduling system which is helping our colleagues in the field complete 14% more tasks a week.\n\n## Modern, modular IT architecture\n\nBy embracing integrated platforms, datadriven analytics and AI, we're radically simplifying and modernising our IT architecture. It's helping us be more agile, make better decisions and create better outcomes for us and our customers.\n\nWe are implementing Google's powerful Cloud Platform to become smarter in our data analysis and AI capabilities across the group. Our new cloud-based decision engine is already using network and premises data to optimise routes for our engineers.\n\nWe have announced our intention to accelerate moving data into our Cloud Data Platform and aim to have 60% of core data in the cloud by the end of 2023. Using AI techniques, we have already successfully used the platform to train our in-app messaging and automated assistant, Aimee, and have unlocked over \u00a3100m in potential benefits from our existing data in the next five years in terms of revenue potential and savings opportunities.\n\nSimultaneously, we are dramatically simplifying our technology estate, having announced the aim to reduce our application count from over 2,420 in 58 stacks to fewer than 500 strategic applications in 14 stacks in the next five years.\n\nWe're changing how we develop products and services, with new digital processes making it faster and simpler to add new features and build new solutions. This includes simplifying our service and change management processes, and implementing our new, modular, event-oriented architecture.\n\nOur Salesforce Evolution is rationalising and upgrading our sales processes, so we are better-placed to deploy changes and launch products and services on an efficient customer-focused platform.\n\nAcross the group, our transformation programmes Making Finance Brilliant and iConnect are streamlining complex finance and HR systems and data, to make them easier to use and automate.\n\n## Customers on strategic networks\n\nSo everyone gets the most reliable connectivity, we're investing in nextgeneration strategic networks. This also unlocks commercial benefits by letting us gradually retire old networks with high running costs.\n\nWe've made good progress on moving customers off our legacy networks and this year we switched off Featurenet - the first of eight networks targeted for closure - saving us approximately \u00a31.8m in run-rate energy costs.\n\nWe take care to minimise disruption when gradually moving customers off these old networks and this year we paused managed migrations off our PSTN network for our consumer customers, as we develop alternative solutions to protect vulnerable users.\n\nAs we look to recover and reuse scarce resources, in line with our commitment to sustainability, this year we estimated that as we replace old copper networks with fibre, we'll be able to recover and sell up to 200k tonnes of copper through the 2030s in line with customer migrations.\n\n## Competitive cost base\n\nWe're saving money as we modernise through better ways of working, improved processes and productivity and by getting rid of old systems and networks.\n\nWe reached our target of \u00a31bn gross annualised cost savings earlier this year and 18 months earlier than planned. We have now extended our gross annualised cost savings target to \u00a32.5bn by the end of FY25, all within the original expected cost to achieve of \u00a31.3bn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read about costs savings achieved to date on page 48 .\n\nWe're also finding better ways of doing business. 'Digital Garage' is a suite of tools which automates high-volume, low-level procurement activities.\n\nOur new procurement company, BT Sourced, is fundamentally shifting our costing and sourcing models streamlining the way we buy goods and services and driving innovative partnerships with suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a31bn\n\nwe've reached our target of \u00a31bn gross annualised cost savings earlier this year and 18 months earlier than planned",

So our people strategy aims to make BT Group a brilliant place to work. This year, we focused on continued skills development, diversity and inclusion, and health, safety and wellbeing.\n\n## Skills and organisational development\n\nContinually nurturing future skills creates a culture where people always want to be at their best. So we continue to invest in colleagues' development - in things like technical skills, agile working, resilience and adaptability.\n\nIt's crucial to match skill supply to future demand. So we're integrating workforce and skills planning capabilities, combined with AI, to bring data-driven external benchmarks into skills development. This is going to help us find ways of matching reskilled colleagues with areas of demand.\n\nWe're also building up flexibility between retail store and contact centre colleagues, which will help to support customers where and when they need.\n\nBT Group plc Annual Report 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis year we hired over 15,200 colleagues, c. 10,800 of them in the UK.

At the same time c. 17,000 colleagues left the organisation - c. 13,700 through natural attrition and c. 3,100 through paid leaver programmes. During the year, Openreach announced a plan to add 4,000 new jobs to support full fibre rollout, 3,000 of which will be apprentices.\n\nWe champion flexible, continuous professional development. Our futureready programme equips colleagues with skills and knowledge to future-proof their career and achieve our ambition. On top of that, 25,000 engineers passed through our 11 world class training schools last year - reskilling for the full fibre world.\n\nIn July our Consumer unit was placed 9th in the Best Big Companies to work for and won a special award for 'giving back'. The award focused on simplicity, leadership and wellbeing and gave us a world class 3-star score.\n\nOur new Digital unit went live on 1 April 2021. As well as building our digital capability it will lead our broader cultural transformation to more flexible and agile working. We intend to significantly reduce our dependency on costly external contractors and bring more digital capabilities in-house over the coming years to boost our productivity and reduce our costs. This year we also signed a new agreement with Distributed that will enable flexible resourcing via freelancers with high demand digital skills. This model is a sustainable way of meeting short-term demand and provides new routes to work regularly with BT or become a permanent employee.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion (D&I)\n\nDiversity, inclusion, accessibility and equality are everyone's business. That's why they're core elements of our people strategy.\n\nThis year we rolled out mandatory antiracism training to all colleagues, helping them challenge racism if they discover it anywhere in our business. And the reverse mentoring programme we started in 2020 for our Executive Committee and senior leaders has helped shape our D&I plans.\n\nWe also announced stretching targets to attract, recruit, promote and keep women, people from ethnic minority groups and disabled people. By 2030, we want our workforce (excl. Openreach) to be made up of 50% women a , 25% ethnic minority b and 17% disabled b colleagues. And we are making progress toward these goals. As an example, this year Openreach recruited over 530 female trainee engineers. As of 31 March 2022, nearly 11% of UK employees said they were of Black, Asian or minority ethnic background c .\n\nThe things we're doing and the targets we're setting show our commitment to making BT Group a fully diverse and inclusive workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on diversity and inclusion, including our Diversity and Inclusion Report, at bt.com/diversity-and-inclusion\n\nYou can find out about our Board's diversity and inclusion on page 87 .\n\n## Health, safety and wellbeing\n\nCovid-19 continued to have a real impact. We focused most on supporting our colleagues, preventing illness through limiting workplace transmission, communicating with colleagues on managing safety during the pandemic and reinforcing testing and vaccination programmes.\n\nWorking with the Department for Health and Social Care, we piloted workplace testing and test click and collect schemes, and supported home asymptomatic testing. During the year we distributed c. 250,000 rapid lateral flow tests to colleagues, aiming to protect the most vulnerable and safely return things to as normal as possible.\n\n- a  Global workforce.\n- b  UK workforce only due to data limitations and based on declared data only.\n- c  UK employees include, amongst others, those who had not disclosed, or had responded 'prefer not to say' in respect of their ethnicity pursuant to our self-declaration campaign.

Another campaign encouraged less stigma and more conversations around mental health.\n\nMore than 700 managers had mental health training to help them support their teams with knowledge, practical skills and the confidence to respond in the right way to anyone struggling. 90% of them agreed or strongly agreed the training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| BT Group plc Board   | BT Group plc Board   | BT Group plc Board   | BT Group plc Board   | BT Group plc Board   |\n|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| 36%                  | Male                 | 7                    |                      |                      |\n| 64%                  | Female               |                      | 4                    |                      |\n|                      | Total                | 11                   |                      |                      |\n| Leadership b         | Leadership b         | Leadership b         | Leadership b         | Leadership b         |\n| 31%                  | Male                 |                      | 75                   |                      |\n| 69%                  | Female               |                      | 34                   |                      |\n|                      | Total                |                      | 109                  |                      |\n| Senior management c  | Senior management c  |                      |                      |                      |\n| 34%                  | Male                 |                      | 515                  |                      |\n| 66%                  | Female               | 264                  |                      |                      |\n|                      | Total                | 779                  |                      |                      |\n| Employees            | Employees            | Employees            | Employees            | Employees            |\n| 26%                  | Male                 | 74,503               |                      |                      |\n| 74%                  | Female               | 25,972               |                      |                      |\n|                      | Total                | 100,475              |                      |                      |\n\ngave them more confidence to deal with mental health problems at work.\n\nWhen colleagues need mental health and wellbeing support and want to talk with someone, they have lots of options.\n\nOur Employee Assistance Programme is a free, 24/7 confidential service for everyone in the organisation, with experts there to help on a range of issues. We have a mental health service with phone or face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy, and our wellbeing portal has lots of self-guided help and support.\n\nSickness absence rose this year, with 3.69% calendar days lost per colleague (up from 3.02% last year d ).\n\n- a  Colleague headcount at 31 March 2022. Excludes approximately 500 colleagues located in jurisdictions where local labour laws restrict reporting of gender.\n- b  For the purpose of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, our leadership comprises the Executive Committee (excluding executive directors on the Board but including the CEO, Openreach) and all of their direct reports.\n- c  For the purpose of the Companies Act 2006, our senior management comprises those employees responsible for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the group, or a strategically important part of it (being members of our senior leadership and senior management teams, and directors of the group's subsidiaries but excluding executive directors on the Board). Numbers presented include 47 subsidiary directors (35 male and 12 female) who are not otherwise members of our leadership or senior management teams.\n- d  2.85% as presented in last year's annual report; restated following review of calculation methodology in FY22.\n\nTo improve how we report and investigate accidents or 'near-misses', we now include supervisors and contractors in our reporting. This year we had 258 lost time injuries as a result of accidents (up from 203 last year). If and when our colleagues need support after an injury, BT-funded rehabilitation returns nearly 95% of them to full duties.\n\n## Improving our workspaces\n\nWe continued to transform our workplaces. In London, we finally bade farewell to our old Newgate Street home and moved into a brand new, state of the art HQ at One Braham in Aldgate. We also opened new sites in Birmingham and Warrington, and we completed major refurbishments in Bangor, Doncaster and Gosforth. And we're now starting developments in Belfast, Bristol, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, Dundee and Plymouth.\n\nOur investment in better working environments is definitely improving colleague satisfaction. In our Birmingham office there's been a 45% rise, taking the overall score to 81%. We're getting similar scores for all our new buildings, demonstrating that we're building strong foundations for the future.\n\n## Pay and benefits\n\nTo attract and keep the best talent, and reward colleagues for their work, we regularly review pay and benefits against competitiveness, sustainability and fairness.\n\nFor BT Group managers eligible for a bonus, we use a scorecard with a mix of financial and non-financial measures. It helps make sure bonuses match our strategic priorities and responsibilities to those of our stakeholders. And, in line with the Commitments, Openreach colleagues' bonuses are linked to Openreach's performance only.\n\nWe've also redesigned our colleague products so that all eligible colleagues get brilliant discounts for themselves and loved ones across all our brands.\n\nColleagues also have the opportunity to join our all-employee share plans; save as you earn and the share incentive plan, to the extent that these are operated each year.",

To surpass their expectations we want to deliver outstanding service and experience and offer smarter, differentiated solutions and outcomes.\n\n## Outstanding service and experience\n\n## Market-leading customer satisfaction\n\nThis year we hit a new all-time high Net Promoter Score (NPS) across the group - with best-ever scores in Consumer, BT SME and Global.\n\nConsumer saw a +5.3 rise in the last 12 months. This was driven by improvements in our BT brand and ongoing strength in EE, and is one of the reasons for Consumer's low churn rate. BT SME saw a +3 NPS improvement in the year. And Global has seen a 20 point increase over the last two years.\n\nWe're cutting complaints too. In the latest Ofcom published report, all BT Group brands saw complaints equal to or lower than the industry average for the first time ever across landlines, broadband and mobile. EE continues to have the equal lowest complaints for a mobile company at just 1 complaint per 100,000 customers. In addition, BT broadband recorded an all-time lowest complaint rate for the brand with a year-on-year reduction of 50%.\n\nEvery single Consumer customer call is now answered in the UK and Ireland. EE remains #1 for broadband call centre satisfaction with Plusnet ranked second. EE also remains #1 for mobile call centres with BT mobile second.\n\nIn the latest Uswitch Telecoms awards, announced in February 2022, the BT and EE brands won five of the seven broadband and TV awards as voted by the public, including 'Broadband Provider of the Year' and 'Most Reliable Broadband Provider', with EE picking up the 'Best Provider for Customer Service'.\n\n## Home Tech Experts\n\nOur partnership with Enjoy offers a delivery and set-up service to our customers across BT broadband and EE mobile products. This year we completed over 230,000 visits to support our customers and saw very high customer satisfaction with NPS above +70.\n\n## Openreach success\n\nOpenreach tirelessly kept millions of UK connections running at a critical moment in history so customers around the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncountry could work-from-home, attend online lessons and communicate with loved ones.\n\nThis year we achieved our best ever service across copper and fibre for Openreach - exceeding all of Ofcom's Quality of Service measures. NPS for our copper and fibre products, as measured by CPs, reached an all-time high during the year and improved by over 5 points. Overall satisfaction, as measured by end users, ended the year at 91.2% - up from 88.4% last year.\n\nDespite the twin pandemic challenges of sickness and delays and a number of significant storms that affected much of the UK in February, we delivered our bestever year for on-time repair at 86% with the highest ever proportion of customers seeing services restored within service level agreements (SLA).\n\nFor new copper and fibre services we offered customers a first appointment date within 12 working days 98.9% of the time (up from 96.2% last year). Only 2.3% of missed appointments were down to Openreach (lower than last year's 2.8%).\n\nAnd we want to do even better. We'll continue to work with CPs to improve our processes and trial new ways of working to improve end customers' experience.\n\n## A new SoHo focus\n\nWe're more dedicated than ever to helping the UK's smallest businesses and in July launched our new SoHo unit within Enterprise.\n\nMicrobusinesses are essential for the UK economy. And recognising the need for specialist microbusiness services, our new unit will serve their digital and connectivity needs. It will offer tailored connectivity, plus solutions around cyber security, digital advertising and digital skills training.\n\n## Brilliant digital customer touchpoints\n\nThis year we launched Aimee, an in-app messaging and automated assistant, to Android customers. It's answered c. 60% of customer queries with great customer satisfaction (NPS of c. 60).",

Halo 3+ has unrivalled reliability - seamlessly switching between BT's broadband and EE's 4G mobile network if there's any disruption to the fixed network.\n\nOverall, approximately 50% of our broadband base is now on one of our Halo products and these customers have on average a 9 point higher NPS than non-Halo customers.\n\nWe've also expanded our 'unbreakable' offers for Enterprise customers. As part of our SoHo launch in June 2021 we offered Halo 3+ to microbusinesses. It comes with business grade security, complete wi-fi coverage across the workplace and free 24/7 support from our Tech Experts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BT TV Box Pro\n\nSupporting the next generation of TV viewing, this year we launched our newest set-top box.\n\nIt includes crystal clear 4K HDR viewing and Dolby Atmos (offering an immersive audio experience) plus up to 600 hours of recording. We also rolled out a new more intuitive TV interface.\n\n## Webex collaboration\n\nBusinesses now work differently, whatever their size. In response, we now offer Cisco's integrated Webex collaboration service to small businesses (we were the first big European CP to do so). It's improving customers' productivity, making hybrid working easier and helping us help small businesses bounce back after the pandemic.\n\n## Digital marketing hub\n\nTo help UK businesses take advantage of the 'digital first' world, we launched our powerful, all-in-one digital marketing hub in October. Many small business customers told us they struggled with digital advertising. So our digital marketing hub lets them create digital adverts, run multi-channel marketing campaigns and optimise results through a simple dashboard with bespoke recommendations and support.\n\n## Enterprise Managed Services\n\nIn October, Enterprise's Managed Services offering was appraised at maturity level 3 of ISACA's Capability Maturity Model Integration framework. This marks BT Group as the only organisation in the UK to successfully publish an appraisal at this level and recognises our Managed Services unit as having high performing work practices. We have over 2,000 managed service experts providing 24/7 support to approximately 2,500 customers across the UK and Ireland.\n\n## 999\n\nOur six call centres handle all 999 calls in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, passing calls to the relevant emergency service. The number of 999 calls handled by BT has jumped from 29m in 2017 to over 39m last year including 180 consecutive days of over 100,000 calls answered. We also saw the busiest New Year's Day ever with our 999 agents handling over 140,000 emergency calls.\n\n## Partnering with Microsoft\n\nIn July we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft. It's focused on cloud-enabled communications solutions - including in industry-specific areas like digital manufacturing and health. By integrating Microsoft applications and Microsoft Azure cloud",

This integrates networking and voice to provide customers with a seamless and secure collaboration service that supports hybrid working.\n\n## Global next generation\n\nGlobal has continued to develop a next generation service portfolio - particularly focused on cloud managed services for multinational customers.\n\nThis year we announced Rackspace Technology, Inc. (a leading end-to-end multi-cloud technology company) as a new cloud partner. Customers will benefit from us combining our network and security capabilities with Rackspace's cloud management expertise. The partnership will uniquely position us to support customers' cloud journeys.\n\nIn September we launched our industryspecific managed cloud solution - BT\n\nCloud Control for Financial Services offering finance customers a secure BT-managed multi-cloud solution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorking with long-standing partner Cisco, we launched the ThousandEyes Cloud and Internet Intelligence managed services to help customers identify faults in their network before they cause disruption.\n\n## Virtual Media Connect\n\nIn broadcasting, security, flexibility and reliability are vital. In October we launched Virtual Media Connect. It lets broadcasters deliver live video in hard to reach 'off-net' locations.\n\nCombining BT Tower, the internet and Amazon Web Services it's a secure, high availability way of transmitting stable video streaming wherever it's needed.\n\n50%\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Our growth plans help us lead the way to a bright, sustainable future. We want to position our portfolio for growth, incubate new tech-driven growth engines and be a leader in responsible, inclusive and sustainable business.\n\n## A portfolio positioned for growth\n\nWe're continuing to strengthen our portfolio to create long-term, sustainable value and better outcomes for our colleagues and customers.\n\nIn May 2022 we reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery to form a 50:50 joint venture company to create a new premium sport offering for the UK & Ireland - combining BT Sport and Eurosport UK. We think this is the best option for our customers and the best future for BT Sport.\n\nWe have award-winning broadcasting capabilities, production expertise and sports rights - including our access to the Premier League until 2025. Warner Bros. Discovery has unique content assets and capabilities. Combining them should boost investment and deliver bigger and better sporting content for our customers.\n\nAs we simplify our business and sharpen our focus we're continuing to divest areas where we believe there's a better owner.\n\nIn June 2021, we sold the Public Administration and Small Medium Enterprise divisions of BT Italia to Telecom Italia. This disposal was an important step to end our domestic operations in Italy, alongside the ending of our domestic operations in Latin America, Spain and France last year.\n\nIn February 2022, we completed the sale of Diamond IP, a non-core software business and provider of proprietary IP Address Management software and services.\n\nWe've partnered with market leading logistics firm GXO to outsource our supply chain activities. That includes transferring around 300 colleagues. GXO's expertise will transform our warehouse and transport capabilities, improve customer\n\nservice, cut costs and give our colleagues better career opportunities.\n\n## Incubating new tech-driven growth engines\n\nWe're driving the future of connectivity. And part of that is investing in breakthrough tech-driven growth engines in areas where we have a strong right to play. By incubating new innovation opportunities we create a pipeline of sustainable revenue streams.\n\n## Security\n\nProtecting the group, our customers and the UK from cyber threats is a vital part of what we do. Every day we protect our infrastructure, networks and customers against 6,500 cyber attacks.\n\nSecurity is a big part of our future growth too. Last year we added to our security armoury which includes a team of 3,000 specialists, 13 global security operations centres and unique network threat intelligence.\n\nIn January, IDC Market Scape named us as a leader in its European Managed Security Services Vendor Assessment report. They recognised our marketleading innovation and partnerships coupled with proven experience and integrated security, network and cloud solutions.\n\nIn October, we launched a cloud-based, self-learning security platform called Eagle-i. It boosts our managed portfolio by improving proactive threat response. The AI-driven solution works with existing controls in real-time to predict, detect and neutralise security threats before they can make an impact.\n\nWe've invested in Silicon Valley cyber security company SAFE Security to help customers better measure and manage cyber risks. The SAFE platform expresses security risks in financial terms, pinpoints vulnerabilities and suggests mitigations. Our multi-million dollar investment gives us exclusive access to use and sell SAFE in the UK.\n\nFor UK business customers, we've made our market-leading Managed Security Services available in Enterprise. The new offers will help them navigate and manage the rapidly evolving cyber security landscape more easily.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital Incubation and Division X\n\nTo boost innovation, this year we created two new teams.\n\nIn Digital, an incubation team is building new digital businesses with a rigorous innovation approach to create new revenue opportunities.\n\nSupporting it, our new start-up partnerships team provides a systematic approach to scouting, vetting and securing deals with start-ups - combining their products with our platforms and go-to-market channels. For example, Feebris, who create AI-guided tools that support care workers to capture and share precise health measurements, are one of four health start-ups onboarded by BT to date.\n\nIn Enterprise, our new Division X team is encouraging next-generation growth for customers. Division X will co-create, scale and commercialise unique solutions in areas such as 5G private networks and IoT. We want it to help businesses benefit from these pioneering technologies.",

They've given customers rich behavioural insights like understanding catchment areas for regional airport passengers.\n\nWe were also proud to support the Department for Health and Social Care with objective, evidence-based analysis that informed the local and national response to Covid-19.\n\n## Healthcare\n\nIn digital healthcare, our Division X team has created a Clinical Advisory Board of eight top NHS clinicians. Their insight and perspective will be invaluable as we develop solutions that use technology to create better outcomes and experiences for the NHS and its patients.\n\n## Drones\n\nIn September, we ran an automated drone trial in Southampton with Associated British Ports and RoboK. It used drones to automatically identify, track and analyse the number of vehicles in the port at any given time.\n\nProject XCelerate, delivered in partnership with award-winning unified traffic management software provider Altitude Angel, is the UK's first commercial drone area in open and unrestricted airspace. Supported by the Government and aviation industry, we're bringing together expertise to test drones' capabilities and showcase potential benefits.\n\n## Our Manifesto\n\nIn December, we launched the BT Group Manifesto (Manifesto) which outlines how we will accelerate growth through technology that is responsible, inclusive and sustainable. It's not only a sustainability plan. It's a growth plan rooted in our purpose to connect for good. Our Manifesto commitments are key to realising growth in our connectivity solutions and new tech-driven growth engines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They're grounded in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are part of our risk management framework.\n\nWe apply the principles right from the start when we design new tech. We've strengthened our privacy impact assessment process with a new online tool that integrates responsible tech and human rights considerations into business decisions.\n\nOur responsible tech steering group oversees the implementation of the principles. The group continued its deep dive into emerging risks and strategic growth areas for BT Group this year, inviting external experts to debate the benefits and risks of topics such as data monetisation and custodianship.\n\nBT Sourced, our new procurement company, has responsible and sustainable criteria embedded in its processes giving our buyers a clear view of related supplier risks and opportunities. We've upped the weighting of these criteria from 10% to 15% in initially assessing who to buy from.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more about BT Sourced on page 39 .\n\nWe've continued working with others to protect privacy and free expression and prevent online harms - from misinformation to online hate. We're currently being assessed against the Global Network Initiative Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy.\n\nWe've also expanded the scope of our global sales due diligence process. This will help us better identify and address the potential human rights impacts of our products and services.\n\n## Inclusive\n\nFuture tech must be diverse and inclusive so that everyone benefits.\n\n## Championing digital inclusion\n\nWe're working to make our networks and tech affordable and accessible to all.\n\nWe're helping more low-income households benefit from our networks. Our social tariff BT Home Essentials offers broadband and calls at around half the price of our standard fibre package. It's available to all customers on Universal Credit and other means-tested benefits. And Openreach's Connect the Unconnected initiative waives connection fees for eligible customers on Universal Credit.\n\nMore than one in five British adults say unexpected life changes during the pandemic mean they now need extra support. So we've launched our Here for You website - putting all our customer support in one easy-to-navigate place. We've also given extra training to customer service colleagues to support these customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe're also expanding digital access to more rural areas - read more about our UK network investment on page 21 .\n\n## Upskilling the nation\n\nHigh-speed connectivity through our networks will make a huge difference to people and businesses in the UK. But only if they have the skills to make the most of the digital world.\n\nWe've helped 4.6m more people improve their digital skills this year - from small businesses and jobseekers to kids getting their first phone. We've helped 14.7m people since FY15 and we're on track to reach our target of 25m by the end of March 2026.\n\nTogether with Google, we've given small businesses free, one-to-one mentoring sessions to help them harness digital skills to grow. We've also run webinars with Small Business Britain and invited entrepreneurs to share advice and practical tips.\n\nThis year we reached over 33,000 jobseekers through our Work Ready virtual training sessions and ran a summer Stand Out Skills campaign to help them be more confident when applying for jobs. Our colleagues have mentored 1,000 of the 2,800 18 to 24-year-olds who've completed Avado's FastFutures training programme since it began in 2020.\n\nWe've created the UK's first phone licence, to help prepare kids for life online. EE's PhoneSmart Licence is a fun and educational online resource to help young people learn how to stay safe and be kind\n\n<!-- image -->",

And targeting online hate, our Hope United campaign was led by a diverse team of top footballers, to help give people the digital skills they need to beat online hate and be a good team player on social media.\n\nIn India, our partnership with the British Asian Trust has helped bring skills and education to 738,000 young people, and in doing so we've exceeded our target of enabling 100,000 teenage girls to stay in school and develop better resilience and employability skills.\n\n## Sustainable\n\nTech must accelerate our journey to net zero emissions and to a circular economy.\n\n## Reaching net zero\n\nWe've led on climate action for 30 years. And now we're acting faster than ever before, bringing forward our net zero goal by 15 years. That means we'll be a net zero carbon emissions business by the end of March 2031 and a net zero business for our supply chain and customers by the end of March 2041.\n\nSince FY17 we've cut our carbon emissions intensity by 55% - slightly down on last year's 57%, as a result of the rebound effect from the pandemic and an increase in vehicle emissions to support our full fibre rollout.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe're on track to reach our 87% target by 2031 (a group KPI) - see page 45 .\n\nAll of the electricity we consume worldwide is renewably sourced a . This has helped us cut our operational carbon emissions by 55% since FY17.\n\nWe've continued making our networks more energy efficient and investments in our new offices have all been done with sustainability in mind. Our newly opened Birmingham and London offices are BREEAM b Excellent buildings which minimise environmental impact. Our One Braham London HQ alone should save over 3m kWh of energy a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall, we've cut our global energy consumption by a further 9 GWh this year. We've added 700 more electric vehicles to our commercial fleet (now over 1,000 in total), we've increased the number of charging points at our sites and engineers' homes, and continued to push for policy measures to support the wider transition to electric vehicles. We're aiming to transition the majority of our vehicles to electric or zero carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nWe continue to work with suppliers to cut carbon. Since FY17 we've cut our supply chain emissions by 28%, making good progress towards our 42% reduction target by 2031. Our pioneering 'climate clause' commits 10 of our key suppliers to make measurable carbon savings during the life of their contracts with us.\n\n## Helping customers cut carbon\n\nThis year around \u00a35bn (25%) of our revenue came from carbon-cutting solutions. We've set a new goal to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of CO2e c by 2030 - by adopting new products, services and tech like FTTP, 5G and IoT.\n\nThrough our Green Tech Innovation Platform, we're working with tech scale-up partners on solutions to help public sector customers get to net zero. Examples include use of IoT in social housing, and sensors giving local councils real-time data on CO2 emissions and air pollution.\n\n25%\n\nof our FY22 revenue came from carbon-cutting solutions\n\n- a  99.9% of the global electricity BT Group consumes is from renewable sources. The remaining 0.1% is where renewable electricity is not available in the market.\n- b  Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method, the world's leading sustainability assessment for infrastructure.\n- c  Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.\n\nWe're encouraging consumer climate action with campaigns like the BT Big Sofa Summit, BT Sport's Green Routine and 'Not Tomorrow. Today.' Our threemonth Smarter Living Challenge with Hubbub found in June 2021 that a series of over 400 tech solutions and small actions could save 1.7 tonnes of CO2e and potentially over \u00a3900 a year in an average household.\n\n## Towards a circular BT Group and beyond\n\nWe aim to be a circular business by 2030 and part of a circular tech and telco ecosystem by 2040. Our network build activities, and initiatives like EE's phone repair service to extend handset lifecycles, are just the start.\n\nThis year, over 1.35m home hubs and set-top boxes have been collected for reuse or recycling, as well as over 170k mobile phones through the EE Trade-In scheme. We recovered or recycled 97% of our operational waste worldwide (99.4% in the UK). We're looking for more ways to reduce waste, repair, refurbish and recycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor our detailed environmental data, see page 69 .\n\n- Our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures statement can be found on page 66.",

We connect with them at all levels of our business. That includes frontline operations, CFUs, CUs and TUs, senior leadership, the Executive Committee and the Board and its committees.\n\nWe engage with them in lots of different ways - from meetings and conferences to reviews, forums and webcasts. To understand how well we're engaging with different groups, the Board and its committees get regular updates. They use them to make better decisions, and give feedback and constructive challenge on activities, programmes and initiatives being considered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur stakeholder management group risk category recognises just how important they are to our business. You can read more on page 58 .\n\nOur Section 172 statement on pages 82 to 83 gives examples of how the Board and its committees took our stakeholders' interests into account in decision-making during the year.\n\n## Colleagues\n\n## Our ambition is only as strong as our foundations, and our colleagues are absolutely central to this.\n\nEngaging with colleagues is critical to creating a culture where they can be their best and contribute towards our purpose, ambition, strategy and long-term success.\n\nWe employ around 98,400 full-time equivalent colleagues in 43 countries. c. 79,900 are in the UK. We also engage with c. 1,600 colleagues through agencies and just over 68,400 other non-regular colleagues.\n\n## Our colleagues need us to:\n\n- \u00b7 share their personal values\n- \u00b7 give them flexible and agile ways of working\n- \u00b7 provide brilliant training, development and career opportunities\n- \u00b7 reward performance with fair and competitive pay and benefits.\n\n## How we engage with colleagues, and the result\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from the chief executive and HR director on our colleagues, how key people strategy initiatives are going, and culture and overall sentiment in the organisation. The pandemic - combined with our ongoing cultural change programme - meant that colleague wellbeing continued to be a priority for Board discussions this year.\n\nGiven our focus on D&I, the Board also spent time discussing this and how it influences strategy, external targets, commitments and progress.\n\nThe Board uses the Colleague Board as its chosen method of engagement with our workforce under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. As designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, Isabel Hudson is the main liaison. She has formal meetings and informal discussions with Colleague Board members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on the work of the Colleague Board in the corporate governance report on pages 80 to 81 .\n\nOnce a year our colleagues tell us how it feels to work here through our Your Say survey. Around 81% of them took part this year, with the results going to our Executive Committee members and senior leadership.\n\nWe got a clear picture of how our colleagues were feeling and a good understanding of what more we can do to make BT Group a brilliant place to work. We included questions on the pandemic. 87% felt we were managing the response\n\nto it well and 90% said we cared about their personal safety.\n\nWe're continually reviewing and improving our approach. So this year we also conducted a mid-year pulse survey which went to a quarter of the business.\n\nOur People Networks are colleague-led groups that share thoughts, opinions and opportunities with our leadership team to help make BT Group truly diverse and inclusive. They're supported by an executive sponsor who champions their purpose and work and provide counsel to the network chairs and deputy chairs.\n\nAs well as listening directly to colleagues, we also hear concerns through more formal engagement channels. In 2021 we renewed our employee relations framework with the CWU. We also established a partnership agreement with Prospect on how we'll work together with recognised trade unions on modernising BT over the coming years. We also continue to formally engage our European Consultative Council and EE employee representatives in the UK.\n\nWhen we act on colleague feedback, we try to pick things with the biggest impact. Longer term, we inform and shape our strategy based on creating a culture where colleagues can be their best. We focus particularly on skills development, diversity and inclusion, and health, safety and wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more about activities during the year on pages 24 to 25 .\n\nThe Remuneration Committee , on behalf of the Board, reviewed the pay, conditions and HR policies across the wider workforce during the year, considering market conditions and the financial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Further to the committee's consideration, we have subsequently committed to paying UK colleagues at least the Real Living Wage and recently increased our minimum salary across the board to reflect that.",

It helps us make sure we're offering the right propositions in the best way to meet their ongoing needs.\n\nOur insight centre of excellence serves all parts of the group to help us understand customers better. It provides research and analysis to give us a deeper knowledge of customer segments and their specific needs.\n\nAcross different customers and channels, we use different methodologies and data sources - like focus groups - to understand perceptions, expectations, needs and behaviours. The insights we get influence how we set strategy, design customer-driven improvements, refine solutions and pricing and develop our brands.\n\nWe invest a lot of time to understand our customers' perspectives. This year we ran sessions for our senior management team where they listened directly to customers about their experience with BT Group focusing as much on where we got things wrong as what we did well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also have two panels which support our customer engagement and include representation from the Board. The Customer Inclusion Panel represents different sections of society with different needs (such as customers with physical disabilities) to help us understand and respond to the range of challenges faced by our customers. The Customer Fairness Panel focuses on ensuring we are treating different customer groups fairly. As an example, it supported our Consumer unit's launch of its social tariff - Home Essentials.\n\nOur Global Advisory Board allows us to meet regularly with top executives from large multinational customers. Similarly, our Security Advisory Board invites senior security clients to discuss cyber security risks and challenges. This helps us understand their priorities, needs and challenges so we can design solutions that deliver the outcomes they're looking for.\n\nOpenreach makes sure all its customers get equal access to our fixed network. It does that through an industry consultation process that is straightforward and compliant - with strong governance controls. All CPs also have the opportunity to engage with Openreach confidentially during initial consultation stages.\n\nOur CFUs monitor how they're doing on delivering for our customers. We track and review customer metrics every month, including NPS. The chief executive, Executive Committee and senior management teams regularly review progress on our customer experience metrics to assess and agree appropriate actions for ongoing improvements.\n\nThe chief executive, Executive Committee and senior leadership also regularly review and discuss complaints directly with customers. The opportunity to actively connect and understand the experiences of our customers helps us to better identify and problem-solve challenges at a high level, benefiting everyone.\n\nWhether it is defining our strategy, approving investment decisions or creating new propositions, the impact on the end customer is always a core consideration to any decisions we make.\n\nThe Board are regularly updated on market trends and customer experiences including NPS. There are detailed discussions at the Board with the CEO of each of the CFUs, including Openreach, on how we are performing and how we can drive improvements for our customers.\n\nThe Board understands the importance of protecting consumers' interests and meeting Government and regulator expectations of a consumer fairness culture, at all levels. The BT Compliance Committee provides Board-level oversight of consumer fairness and discusses this at each of its meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about steps we've taken to ensure consumer fairness on page 16 .",

The AGM 2021 was a hybrid event, held in line with Government pandemic restrictions at the time. Shareholders were provided with the opportunity to ask questions in advance or in the meeting itself. All resolutions put to the meeting received overwhelming support of investors.\n\nThe results of the voting at all general meetings are published on our website: bt.com/agm\n\nWe will publish the arrangements for the AGM 2022 in the Notice of meeting (see page 119 ).\n\nThe company secretary or her delegate communicates with individual investors, making sure we respond properly to questions about their shareholding. Our share registrar Equiniti also liaises with our shareholders in relation to any specific shareholder queries.\n\nWe manage relationships with institutional investors and debt investors through our investor relations programme. It includes one-to-one conversations, roadshows, group meetings, conferences and industry events. The chairman, senior independent director and other directors, as appropriate, also liaise with investors. During the year, the chairman (current and previous) also met investors to discuss their views on the business.\n\nThis year the directors, chief executive, chief financial officer, other executives and the investor relations team held 248 meetings with investors. Key topics included:\n\n- \u00b7 BT Group's strategy and competitive position in key markets\n- \u00b7 financial and operational performance (particularly the impact of a higher inflationary environment on the business, and medium- to long-term cash flow)\n- \u00b7 appointment of our new chairman\n- \u00b7 capital investment\n- \u00b7 capital allocation policy\n- \u00b7 prospective governmental and regulatory policy decisions\n- \u00b7 pension fund valuation.\n\nThe Board gets regular reports on our top shareholders, movements in the share register, share price performance and how we're engaging with institutional investors and analysts. It also discusses shareholder issues with management and advisers and considers these as part of its decision-making.\n\n## Communities\n\n## We're at the heart of the communities we operate in, and help bring them together.\n\nWe need all the communities we serve to trust us. Without that, we cannot deliver our growth plans - or our purpose to connect for good.\n\n## Communities rely on us to:\n\n- \u00b7 give them reliable and secure connections\n- \u00b7 help local people and SMEs get more from the digital world\n- \u00b7 protect the environment and help tackle issues like climate change\n- \u00b7 do business ethically and responsibly.\n\n## How we engage with communities, and the result\n\nWe touch communities across the UK every day through customer interactions at EE/BT retail stores, home visits to set up broadband and mobile services, and through people using our products and services to connect, live, work, learn and play.\n\nTo understand what matters most to our communities, we engage with them and use the insights to inform our focus areas, targets and programmes.\n\nThis year, our Hope United campaign responded to experiences of online hate and our new Here For You website helped people get the additional support they told us they needed as a result of Covid-19.

Our international charity partner, UNICEF, is at the forefront of the humanitarian response - BT colleagues are donating to the children's emergency fund run by UNICEF, who distribute aid to affected children.\n\nWe have a group KPI to reach 25m people in the UK with help to improve their digital skills by the end of March 2026. We also measure reputational performance and trust to track how we're perceived across communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More on how we've supported communities and the environment this year can be found on pages 34 to 35 .\n\n## Suppliers\n\nGood supplier relationships are essential for our success. They help us deliver solutions and propositions that create standout customer experiences.\n\nWe source from all over the world, with suppliers in nearly 100 countries.\n\n## Suppliers need us to:\n\n- \u00b7 pay them in line with our agreed terms\n- \u00b7 help them optimise their own supply chains\n- \u00b7 act ethically and transparently.\n\n## How we engage with suppliers, and the result\n\nWe need to know who we're doing business with, and who's acting on our behalf. So we:\n\n- \u00b7 choose suppliers based on principles that make sure we act ethically and responsibly\n- \u00b7 undertake due diligence on suppliers before and after we sign a contract, which covers financial health, antibribery and corruption, and whether they meet our standards on areas such as quality management, security and data privacy\n- \u00b7 check the things we buy are made, delivered, and disposed of in a socially and environmentally responsible way\n- \u00b7 measure suppliers' energy use, environmental impact and labour standards, and work with them to improve these.\n\nDuring the year we launched BT Sourced, a new standalone procurement company based in Dublin which has established itself as a hub for many 'Big Tech' businesses as well as technology start-ups. BT Sourced has been established to challenge the traditional ways of buying goods and services by simplifying processes and introducing new technology and partnershipbased approaches to the way we work with suppliers and start-ups.",

This new partnership forms part of our ongoing strategy to simplify and modernise our business, which continues to make strong progress. We will be outsourcing our core warehouse and transport capabilities, while ensuring that the group's market-leading next generation network build plans remain on track.\n\nDuring the year, we have faced significant inflationary headwinds from a range of factors such as a global shortage of chipsets, rising energy prices and higher shipping costs, which we have worked with our suppliers to mitigate as much as possible.\n\nTo further strengthen our capacity to deal with such challenges, BT Sourced will also accelerate the adoption of new technology that can challenge some traditional ways of buying and encourage more collaboration.\n\nFor example, we have introduced tools that make it easier for suppliers to deal with us and that automatically engage several suppliers simultaneously. These tools are encouraging greater\n\ncompetition within our supplier base\n\nwhich generates more opportunities, particularly for smaller suppliers, while also creating more capacity for human-to-human interaction that can focus on tackling the most important issues across our supply base.\n\nDuring the year, we joined the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) of telecommunications operators, which conducts and share corporate social responsibility audits of suppliers. JAC aims to verify, assess and develop the implementation of corporate social responsibility across the manufacturing centres of important multinational suppliers to the information communications and technology (ICT) industry.\n\nJAC members share resources and best practices to develop long-term CSR implementation in the ICT supply chain at an international level. This should make sure BT Group's growth is responsible, inclusive and sustainable.\n\nWe also continue to engage with suppliers on a range of proactive initiatives - for example progress towards net zero carbon emissions, including the increased uptake in renewable energy, and cutting plastic packaging and waste.\n\nThis is a key part of our digital impact and sustainability strategy, so the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee regularly discuss initiatives. Feedback is used to continually enhance our approach.\n\nDuring the year, the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee discussed programmes and initiatives in place across the group to manage risks within our supply chain, including how we mitigate these risks and ensure that we continue to be a responsible, inclusive and sustainable business.\n\nWe are actively encouraging and helping our suppliers to meet and match our own D&I commitments. We've also taken more diversity-led steps in our dealings with suppliers, such as systematically assessing diversity when taking on new suppliers.\n\n## UK Government\n\nWe add over \u00a324bn to the UK economy\u00aa, supporting critical services and working with more than 1,200 public sector focused customers.\n\nOur networks support the functioning of vital public services like welfare, tax, health, social care, police and defence, while protecting citizens' personal data. Our relationship with Government bodies supports our strategic priorities - as well as enabling us to contribute to policies and initiatives that benefit our stakeholders.\n\n## Government stakeholders need us to:\n\n- \u00b7 keep investing in network infrastructure\n- \u00b7 provide the fastest, most reliable and secure connection possible, to the widest possible range of communities\n- \u00b7 create fairly-priced products and services, backed by brilliant customer service.",

Our priority is fulfilling our responsibilities and obligations for the country and our customers.\n\nOur Enterprise unit delivers and looks after public sector contracts and services like the Emergency Services Network (see page 28 ). We've also continued to support the Government and NHS teams dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOur policy and public affairs team manages our relationships with Government and other politicians.\n\nUnder the Communications Act 2003, the Government can ask us (and others) to run or restore services during disasters. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 also says that it can impose obligations on us (and others) in emergencies, or in connection with civil contingency planning.\n\nWe keep an open dialogue with Government through our chairman, chief executive and senior leaders, as well as through consultation responses and cross-industry initiatives. Through those conversations we build support for policies that will deliver good results for the UK and our shareholders.\n\nOur public policy work with Government covers a wide remit, from infrastructure investment to national security, from regulating online harms to trade and economic policy.\n\nIn the past year we have contributed to a range of Government initiatives for example on wireless infrastructure strategy, supply chain diversification, data strategy, drones and AI.\n\nWe continue to make good progress in delivering against our SRN obligations (see page 16 ), supporting this key industry-government initiative and maintaining EE's 4G coverage leadership.\n\nWe've also provided input into consultations on key legislation including the Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021, the Product Safety and Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill and the Online Safety Bill.\n\nThe Board gets regular updates on discussions with Government through the chairman, chief executive and Executive Committee members, with the Board providing views and comments.\n\n## Regulators\n\nCommunications and TV services are regulated. This makes sure rules and standards are consistent in each jurisdiction, which in turn protects consumers and promotes competition.\n\nIf we don't engage effectively with our regulators, we risk unnecessary regulatory intervention that could stand in the way of us achieving our strategy.\n\nOur main regulatory relationship is with Ofcom in the UK. The main source of Ofcom's powers and duties is the Communications Act 2003, which gives it general economic and consumer regulatory powers for the sector.\n\nWe also engage with other regulatory bodies like the Competition and Markets Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\n## Ofcom needs to:\n\n- \u00b7 advance citizens' and consumers' interests, often by promoting competition\n- \u00b7 encourage investment and innovation\n- \u00b7 support investment in the UK's critical digital infrastructure.\n\n## How we engage with Ofcom, and the result\n\nWe have a positive and open dialogue with Ofcom through our chairman, chief executive and senior leaders.\n\nOur conversations focus on how regulation can support Ofcom's ambition for a world class UK digital infrastructure and allow efficient investment, while keeping the market fair and competitive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details of the main regulatory topics we cover with Ofcom see pages 16 to 17 .\n\nIn 2017, we put in place the Commitments. It provides Openreach with a greater degree of strategic and operational independence, in line with objectives set out in Ofcom's Digital Communications Review.\n\nIn December 2021, Ofcom noted that Openreach continues to operate with a 'high degree of independence from BT' b and that there were 'strong structures and processes' in place at both BT Group and Openreach which helped support compliance.\n\nOfcom says that BT Group and Openreach are still making good progress to safeguard Openreach's independence. We continue to engage with Ofcom and CPs to maintain their confidence that we're following both the letter and spirit of the Commitments.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the BT Compliance Committee monitors our compliance with the Commitments, including our culture and behaviours of our colleagues.\n\nOfcom attended a BT Compliance Committee meeting during the year and discussed feedback on the Commitments and Ofcom's relationship with us. The Board are also regularly updated on any key meetings between Ofcom and the chairman, chief executive and others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more on the work of the BT Compliance Committee in the corporate governance report on page 96 .",

See the Report on directors' remuneration on page 102 .\n- a  We gave our original financial outlook in May 2021 and subsequently adjusted our revenue outlook in February 2022. You can read more on page 46 .\n- b  Adjusted EBITDA as stated is before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net non-interest related finance expense, as explained on page 210 .\n- c  Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 209 .\n- d  Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 211 .\n- e  The number of EE consumer customers receiving or capable of receiving a 5G network connection using one or both of a 5G-enabled handset and a 5G-enabled SIM.\n\n## Financial Year ended 31 March\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReported revenue was \u00a320,850m (FY21: \u00a321,331m). The decrease was primarily due to revenue declines in our Enterprise and Global units offset by growth in Openreach, with revenue in Consumer flat. You can read more about CFU performance on pages 52 to 53 .\n\nWe delivered robust operational performance in FY22. Financial performance was broadly in line with guidance a .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis tracks changes in our customers' perceptions of BT Group since we launched the measure in April 2016. It's a combined measure of 'promoters' minus 'detractors' across our business units. BT Group NPS measures the net promoter score in our retail business and net satisfaction in our wholesale business.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nBT Group NPS increased by 2.3 percentage points (FY21: up 7.8 percentage points), a new all-time high supported by strong results in year for Consumer, BT SME and Global. You can read more about these and our approach to customer experience on page 27 .\n\n## Adjusted b EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis measures our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net non-interest related finance expenses.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nAdjusted b EBITDA was \u00a37,577m (FY21: \u00a37,415m). Growth was driven by savings from our modernisation programmes, tight cost management and lower indirect commissions, which more than offset revenue decline. You can read more on page 48 . Lease payments are not included in adjusted b EBITDA following adoption of IFRS 16 Leases in FY20.\n\nWe use eleven KPIs - five operational and six financial.\n\nWe reconcile the financial measures to the closest IFRS measure on pages 209 to 211 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Definition\n\nThis tracks how many premises are connected to Openreach's full fibre (FTTP) network.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nAlmost 1.8m customers were connected to Openreach's FTTP network at 31 March 2022 (FY21: 0.9m). Openreach's full fibre footprint reaches more than 7m homes and businesses - more than our competitors combined - and we're on track to get to 25m premises by the end of 2026. You can read more about the full fibre rollout on page 21 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted b EBITDA margin improved 1pp to 36% (FY21: 35%). The increase is mainly driven by improved adjusted b EBITDA which more than offset the impact of the decline in revenue. You can read more on page 48 . Adjusted b EBITDA margin from FY20 is benefited by the adoption of IFRS 16.",

This was down slightly on last year's result of 57%, as a result of the rebound effect from the pandemic and due to an increase in vehicle emissions to support fibre rollout.

As these are not defined under IFRS they are termed 'non-GAAP' or 'alternative performance' measures. We reconcile these to the nearest prepared measure in line with IFRS on pages 209 to 211 . The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly-titled measures used by other companies.\n\n- a  Adjusted EBITDA is stated before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net non-interest related finance expense, as explained on page 210 .\n- b  Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 209 .\n- c  Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the period, excluding spectrum.\n- d  Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 211\n\n.\n\n- e  Financial outlook originally provided in May 2021 was updated in February 2022 to reduce the adjusted revenue outlook from broadly flat to down c.2% as a result of the ongoing impact of Covid-19 and supply chain issues.\n- f  Loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (both current and non-current), less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Please refer to note 26 of the consolidated financial statements for reconciliation from nearest IFRS measure.\n\n## Performance\n\nOverall our results for the year were in line with our guidance.\n\nReported revenue was \u00a320,850m, down 2% and adjusted b revenue was \u00a320,845m, down 2%. Revenue has grown in Openreach, was flat in Consumer, but declined in Enterprise and Global as a result of challenging market conditions.\n\nAdjusted a EBITDA of \u00a37,577m was up 2%, with revenue decline more than offset by lower costs from our modernisation programmes, tight cost management, and lower indirect commissions.\n\nReported profit before tax was \u00a31,963m, up 9% with higher adjusted a EBITDA offsetting higher finance expenses.\n\nCapital expenditure c of \u00a34,807m was up 14% primarily due to continued higher spend on our fibre infrastructure and mobile networks.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d was \u00a31,392m, down 5% primarily due to higher cash capital expenditure, partially offset by higher adjusted a EBITDA and lower tax payments.\n\n## Financial outlook\n\nWe face a challenging external environment. However, we currently have index linked pricing across around twothirds of our revenue before eliminations, primarily in Consumer and Openreach, which will help to mitigate the impact of inflationary cost pressures in labour, energy and the supply chain in FY23.\n\nWe continue to expect to deliver growth in revenue and at least \u00a37.9bn adjusted a EBITDA in FY23, with stronger Consumer and Openreach financials offsetting challenges in our enterprise businesses.\n\nAs we have said previously, capital expenditure c in FY23 will remain at its peak level of around \u00a34.8bn before spectrum costs.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d is expected to be \u00a31.3bn to \u00a31.5bn.\n\nFY23 outlook\n\nChange in adjusted b revenue\n\nGrowth\n\nAdjusted a EBITDA\n\nAt least \u00a37.9bn\n\nCapital expenditure c\n\nAround \u00a34.8bn\n\nNormalised free cash flow d\n\n\u00a31.3bn - \u00a31.5bn",

        "page_content": "Following completion of our sports joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery, expected by the end of 2022, we expect group revenues to reduce by \u00a30.5bn \u00a30.6bn per annum relative to FY22. We do not expect a material impact on our FY23 adjusted a EBITDA outlook. We will confirm the full impact on all our outlook metrics following completion.\n\nExcluding the impact of the above joint venture, on a like-forlike basis we expect sustainable revenue and adjusted\u00aa EBITDA growth beyond FY23.\n\nAs mentioned on page 23 we have now extended our gross annualised cost savings target to \u00a32.5bn by FY25, within the expected cost to achieve of \u00a31.3bn.\n\nWe remain confident in the delivery of long-term normalised free cash flow d growth. By the end of the decade we expect an expansion of at least \u00a31.5bn in normalised free cash flow d compared to FY22, solely from lower capital expenditure and operating costs as we move towards an all-fibre, all-IP network. In addition, the move to FTTP will enable us to recover copper from our legacy network. Initial estimates indicate that around 200k tonnes of copper could be recovered from our network through the 2030s. We are currently undertaking trials to better understand the costs associated with recovering this valuable asset. These benefits are structural upsides as the business changes, on top of the free cash flow arising from organic growth in revenue and the benefit of further transformation efficiencies, including the additional cost savings target, net of tax.\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe have declared a final dividend for FY22 of 5.39 pence per share, bringing the full year FY22 total, as promised, to 7.70 pence per share, and our intention is to continue with a progressive dividend policy. Our progressive dividend policy is to maintain or grow the dividend each year whilst taking into consideration a number of factors including underlying medium-term earnings expectations and levels of business reinvestment.\n\nThe Board expects to continue with this policy for future years, and to declare two dividends per year with the interim dividend being fixed at 30% of the prior year's full year dividend.\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief Financial Officer 11 May 2022\n\n|                               | Financial outlook e   | Result    | Performance in line  with or better than  financial outlook   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Change in adjusted b  revenue | Down c.(2)%           | Down (2)% |                                                               |\n| Adjusted a  EBITDA            | \u00a37.5bn - \u00a37.7bn       | \u00a37.6bn    |                                                               |\n| Capital expenditure c         | c.\u00a34.9bn              | \u00a34.8bn    |                                                               |\n| Normalised free cash flow d   | \u00a31.1bn - \u00a31.3bn       | \u00a31.4bn    |                                                               |\n\nRevenue\n\n\u00a3m\n\n## \u00a320,850m (2)%\n\n21,331\n\n20,850\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFY22 Capital expenditure c\n\n## \u00a34,807m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNormalised free cash flow d \u00a3m\n\nOperating cash flow \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProfit before tax \u00a3m\n\n## \u00a31,963m 9%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet debt\n\n\u00a3m\n\nf\n\n## \u00a318,009m \u00a3207m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Earnings per share\n\npence\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was partially offset by higher rental bases in fibre-enabled products, relationship-driven equipment sales in Global and stronger recurring BT Sport revenue as a result of the prior year Covid-19 induced cancellations.\n\nYou can find details of revenue by CFU on pages 52 and 53 . Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements shows a full breakdown of revenue by all our major product and service categories.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nReported operating costs were down 4%, primarily due to savings from our modernisation programmes, tight cost control and lower indirect commissions.\n\nIn May 2020 we announced the next phase of our transformation focused on simplifying our product portfolio, simplifying and automating our customer journeys, moving to a modern, modular IT architecture, and migrating customers from our legacy networks to our modern FTTP and 5G networks.\n\nDuring FY22 we delivered gross annualised savings of \u00a30.7bn with a cost to achieve of \u00a30.3bn, bringing total gross annualised savings over the past two years to \u00a31.5bn with a cost to achieve of \u00a30.8bn. You can read more about how we're transforming our cost base and our new savings targets on page 23 .\n\nNote 6 to the consolidated financial statements shows a detailed breakdown of our operating costs.\n\n## Adjusted c EBITDA\n\nAdjusted c EBITDA of \u00a37,577m increased by 2% with the reduced operating costs more than offsetting revenue decline.\n\nYou can find details of adjusted c EBITDA by CFU on pages 52 and 53 .\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nReported profit before tax of \u00a31,963m was up 9%, reflecting increased adjusted c EBITDA and despite increased finance expense from pension deficit movements.\n\n## Specific items\n\nAs we explain on page 209 , we separately identify and disclose those items that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. We call these specific items. Specific items are used to derive the adjusted results as presented in the consolidated income statement. Adjusted results are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assists in providing an additional analysis of the reported trading results of the group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Specific items resulted in a net charge after tax of \u00a3728m (FY21: \u00a3403m). The main components were a net tax charge on remeasurement of deferred tax of \u00a3420m (FY21: \u00a3nil) and restructuring charges of \u00a3347m (FY21: \u00a3421m). Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements shows the full details of all revenues and costs that we have treated as specific items.\n\n## Taxation\n\nOur effective tax rate was 35.1% (FY21: 18.4%) on reported profit which mainly reflects the remeasurement of our deferred tax balances following the enactment of the new UK corporation tax rate of 25% from April 2023. The corresponding adjustment comprises a net tax charge of \u00a3420m in the income statement and a non-recurring tax credit of \u00a3298m in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted b profit was 14.8%. This is lower than FY21 (18.6%) as we expect a large proportion of our capital spend on fibre rollout to be eligible for the Government's super-deduction regime, which allows for enhanced tax relief on qualifying capital expenditure. The super-deduction regime is available for FY22 and FY23, driving a projected UK tax loss for these periods, with around \u00a35bn of tax losses expected to be carried forward from FY23. A net UK deferred tax charge has been recorded, reflecting the deferred tax liability arising on qualifying capital expenditure, offset in part by a deferred tax asset on the current period tax loss.\n\nWe paid income taxes globally of \u00a352m (FY21: \u00a3288m). We paid UK corporation tax of \u00a3nil, benefiting from the super-deduction noted above (FY21: \u00a3229m). We benefited \u00a3nil from tax deductions on employees' pension and share schemes (FY21: \u00a3181m).\n\nOur tax expense recognised in the income statement before specific items was \u00a3349m (FY21: \u00a3428m). We also recognised a \u00a3430m tax charge (FY21: \u00a31,051m tax credit) in the statement of comprehensive income, mainly relating to our pension scheme.\n\nWe expect our sustainable income statement effective tax rate before specific items to be around the UK rate of corporation tax, as we do most of our business in the UK.\n\nNote 10 to the consolidated financial statements shows further details of our tax expense, along with our key tax risks.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nReported earnings per share was 12.9p, down 1.9p, while adjusted b earnings per share increased 1.4p to 20.3p.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure was \u00a35,286m (FY21: \u00a34,216m). The increase was primarily due to investment in spectrum of \u00a3479m, along with increased investment in our full fibre and mobile network. Capital expenditure excluding spectrum was \u00a34,807m.\n\nCapital expenditure contracted but not yet spent was \u00a31,596m at 31 March 2022 (FY21: \u00a31,370m).\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash inflow from operating activities was down 1% to \u00a35,910m, mainly as a result of working capital movements.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d was down 5% to \u00a31,392m due to higher cash capital expenditure partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA c and lower tax and lease payments.\n\nYou can see a reconciliation to normalised free cash flow d from net cash inflow from operating activities (the most directly comparable IFRS measure) on page 211 .\n\nThe net cash cost of specific items adjusted from normalised free cash flow d was \u00a3610m (FY21: \u00a3390m), primarily relating to restructuring payments of \u00a3370m (FY21: \u00a3428m) and the Dixons Carphone settlement (refer to note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for more details). In addition, net cash proceeds from divestments were \u00a376m (FY21: \u00a3164m).\n\n- a  Excluding depreciation and amortisation.\n- b  Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 209 .\n- c  Adjusted EBITDA is stated before specific items, share of post tax profits/losses of associates and joint ventures and net non-interest related finance expense, as explained on page 210 .\n- d  Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 211 .",

Net of deferred tax, the deficit has decreased from \u00a34.2bn to \u00a31.0bn.\n\nThe decrease in the gross deficit of \u00a34.0bn since 31 March 2021 mainly reflects an increase in the real discount rate, \u00a31.1bn of deficit contributions paid over the period, lower assumed future life expectancies due to an allowance for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and positive asset returns. This has been partially offset by higher inflation over the year than assumed at 31 March 2021.\n\n## The movements in the deficit for the group's defined benefit plans are shown below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote 20 to the consolidated financial statements gives more information on our pension arrangements.\n\n## Net debt b and net financial debt\n\nNet financial debt (which excludes lease liabilities) at 31 March 2022 was \u00a312.2bn, \u00a30.6bn higher than at 31 March 2021 (\u00a311.7bn), with net capital expenditure (after spectrum refund), pension contributions, net interest payments, payments of lease liabilities and share purchases more than offsetting net cash inflow from operating activities.\n\nNet debt b (which includes lease liabilities) was \u00a318.0bn at 31 March 2022, \u00a30.2bn higher than at 31 March 2021 (\u00a317.8bn). The difference to the movement in net financial debt reflects lease movements.\n\nAt 31 March 2022 the group held cash and current investment balances of \u00a33.5bn. The current portion of loans and other borrowings is \u00a30.9bn; we have no term debt repayable during FY23. Our \u00a32.1bn facility, which matures in March 2027, remains undrawn at 31 March 2022.\n\nGross debt translated at swap rates and excluding accrued interest and fair value adjustments was \u00a321.5bn at 31 March 2022. This comprises term debt of \u00a315.1bn, lease liabilities of \u00a35.8bn and other loans of \u00a30.6bn.\n\n- a  There has been a broadly equivalent benefit to inflation-linked assets from higher inflation.",

        "page_content": "## A letter from the Chair of Openreach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## It's fair to say it's been another challenging year\n\nThe pandemic continued causing complexity and concern, while increasingly extreme winter weather seriously tested both our engineers and customers.\n\nOur purpose hasn't changed; we're the UK's broadband network and we're keeping the nation connected during these challenging times.\n\nWith all this in mind, I'm hugely proud that we had our best service performance for copper and fibre products this year meeting or exceeding all of Ofcom's quality of service standards - and driven customer satisfaction to a record high.\n\nWe've also built our new ultrafast, ultra-reliable full fibre network at a record pace, reaching 50,000 premises every week.\n\n## In execution mode\n\nOne of the main reasons for recent success is our crystal clear priorities.\n\nWith Ofcom's long-term regulatory framework now firmly established, we're no longer in planning or investment case mode. It's now all eyes forward on execution.\n\nWe've been operationalising our plan - building and upgrading millions of customers to our new network - and doing that while delivering the very best customer experience.\n\nIt's our job to stay stable and sustainable for our shareholder BT Group plc, Openreach colleagues and customers, and the nation. And I'm pleased we've made such good progress.\n\n## Build, build, build\n\nToday we're building full fibre faster and cheaper than ever before, reaching more than 7m premises and counting (more than our competitors combined). We're on track to get to 25m premises by the end of 2026.\n\nOpenreach will never be just a city fibre builder. Of course, connecting rural\n\nhomes is tough, expensive and complex, but we don't want to leave anyone behind. We've always gone the extra mile to connect isolated communities with inventive engineering and funding solutions - and that will continue.\n\nOur plans include a big commitment to rural Britain, and are fundamental to the UK Government bringing 'gigabit capable' broadband to 85% of the country by 2025.\n\n## Driving take-up\n\nBuilding our full fibre network is pointless if customers don't upgrade to it.\n\nSo we're working with CPs to drive rapid take-up. Our commercial offer, Equinox, gives long-term pricing certainty for those that commit to selling full fibre where it's available. So far 42 CPs have signed up - including all our largest customers.\n\nIn total, almost 1.8m homes and businesses are now reaping the benefits of full fibre. We're now breaking records on order volumes and provisioning activity every week, so the strong customer demand we're seeing should continue.\n\n## Upgrading the UK to digital phone lines\n\nAt more than a quarter of the way through our build and with more customers upgrading than ever, we are starting to speed up work on withdrawing our old copper-based network.\n\nWe need to get customers switched to all-digital quickly as we work with CPs to close down analogue services by the end of 2025.\n\nEducating consumers about full fibre's benefits will be vital, and we know we must help drive digital awareness and take-up to make sure no one is left behind.\n\n## Investing in people, diversity and inclusion\n\nWe employ 37,000 people across the UK and we're proud to be the largest apprenticeship provider in the private sector.\n\nThis year, we announced we'd be creating another 4,000 jobs building and maintaining our networks. We're also aiming to retrain an extra 3,000 existing engineers to support customers on our new platform.\n\nWe've been making progress on being more inclusive and diverse. Engineering has historically been dominated by white men. But we want to represent the\n\ncommunities we serve better and attract brilliant and diverse talent to boost our creativity and innovation.\n\nAround 16% of our trainee recruits were women last year - up from 12% the previous year, partly thanks to us making the language of job adverts less gendered.\n\nAnd we're going further. We have an ambitious new set of goals, including targets on ethnic minority representation, in our D&I commitments.\n\n## Building responsibly and safely\n\nAs one of Britain's largest businesses, we know we have a duty to society that's continually under review - and we take that responsibility seriously.\n\nThere are lots of ways we can make positive changes, but perhaps the biggest opportunity is through our fleet.\n\nWith more than 29,000 vehicles, we run the UK's second largest commercial van fleet. It helps our engineers serve customers in every corner of the country. But it has a negative impact on the environment too. So we're aiming to switch the majority of our fleet to electric or zero emissions by 2030.\n\nWe've already bought more than 1,000 electric vans but there are some big challenges to overcome to reach our target. There needs to be a national charging infrastructure to support people travelling around the country. Incentives for converting major fleets like ours need to stay. They'll have a big effect on the second-hand market and help the UK meet its net zero target.\n\nSafety is also a big priority. We reached an important goal this year with all of our engineers now using new, safer ladder equipment which is dramatically reducing falls from height.\n\n## All eyes forward\n\nLike nothing before, the pandemic has underlined that internet access and decent broadband are no longer a luxury but a necessity and showed that no one should be left behind.\n\nThe research agrees. Full fibre is faster and more reliable, and will deliver huge economic, social and environmental benefits right across the UK.\n\nIt's the right thing for our business, shareholder, colleagues, customers and the nation. Our priorities are crystal clear. So you'll continue to see us in execution mode next year and beyond.\n\n## Mike McTighe\n\nChair, Openreach\n\n11 May 2022",

This not only helps us protect BT Group, but helps drive our growth.\n\n## Strong foundations built on trust\n\nWe've built our business to thrive based on stakeholder trust. This means we must manage risks smartly to achieve our ambition, deliver our strategy, support our business model, and protect our assets while leading the way to a bright, sustainable future.\n\nOur approach to risk is simple and consistent: we have our risk mindset and culture , which encapsulates our risk process and activities and is brought together by risk leadership and governance . Collectively, this is our risk management framework.\n\n## Risk mindset and culture\n\nWe engender a set of behaviours and expectations that drive risk awareness throughout our business activities. It is driven by the tone from the top and supported by our people management systems and promotes timely and sensible risk interventions and actions that improve operational integrity and help make smart choices about risks being bold without being reckless.\n\nWe communicate expected behaviours to every colleague through our code to get risk awareness woven into the fabric of our culture. We have an ongoing programme of training and communication, and defined roles to formalise risk management, while continuing to integrate risk thinking and procedures into key areas of decisionmaking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have our risk mindset and culture, which encapsulates our risk process and activities and is brought together by risk leadership and governance.'\n\n## The Art of Risk Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Appetite\n\nWe have a risk Appetite statement setting out the group's attitude to how much risk we are willing to take in each GRC. These are underpinned by appetite metrics with upper and lower boundaries that set tolerances for risk.\n\n## Rules\n\nWe then have a clear and simple set of Rules , which are encoded in the key policies, standards and controls required to manage our risks.\n\n## Risk process and activities\n\nOur approach to risk management has evolved over the last few years with a focus on making it clear and simple across all business areas, facilitating learning, aggregation, shared responses, consistent and efficient activities; and effective dot-joining.\n\nWe divide our risk landscape into group risk categories (GRCs) of our enduring risks - like communications regulation and financial control - that will continue to be important to us over time and can be managed consistently.\n\n## Three Lines of Defence\n\nThe Three Lines of Defence model establishes the roles and responsibilities of those that own and manage risks in the business (1st line), specialist support and assurance functions (2nd line) and independent assurance providers (3rd line). This clarity and co-ordination helps provide assurance that these risks are managed effectively giving confidence to relevant stakeholders.\n\nWe are also constantly aware of and deal with specific risks and uncertainties that arise which are significant and dynamic in nature, our point risks and emerging risks.\n\nFor each GRC, we have developed an approach that we call The ART of Risk Management. This year we've made good progress in establishing the ART of Risk Management across each GRC, which is driving improved accountability, helping to monitor exposures; delivering assurance over the design and operation of key controls; and providing clarity on actionable steps to take the right decisions at the right times.",

Our leaders visibly believe in, support and are constantly engaged in risk management throughout their activities, ensuring risk is considered in key business processes and decisions.\n\nThere is an Executive Committee sponsor for each GRC. They set out how we measure our exposure to that category of risk, how we manage it (including setting the right policies and controls) and ensure that we take the actions necessary to achieve and maintain our target risk appetite and level of control. Point and emerging risks relating to each GRC are continuously reviewed and managed. Each GRC and the corresponding Executive Committee sponsorship is group-wide, with the aim of ensuring we join dots across the business and think about our risks in a non-siloed manner.\n\nEach of our units (CFUs, TUs and CUs) also reviews, on a periodic basis, its exposure in all these categories and identifies and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philip Jansen Chief executive\n\n'BT Group is forward looking and innovative but also built on trust, which is about being smart in the risks we take to transform'\n\n## Marc Allera\n\nCEO, Consumer\n\n'Trust is not letting our customers down, ever.

This promotes robust discussion and prioritisation, the right monitoring, and better decision-making.\n\n## Continuous learning and improvement\n\nWhether it's reviewing and adjusting risk appetite, managing new or emerging risks, implementing action plans, working with new stakeholders or managing risks in new programmes and change initiatives, risk management is a continuous process. We're also always evolving, learning and adapting to help build the right mindset and culture, value-adding process and activities and effective leadership and governance. The goal however remains constant: to help the organisation make smarter decisions to protect BT Group and help drive growth.\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief financial officer 'The leadership of the group understands the critical role that great risk management, great assurance and great controls play in our long-term health and success'\n\n## Sabine Chalmers General counsel, company secretary & director regulatory affairs\n\n'Risk management underpinned by our code sets out the principles of how we expect our people to behave, do business and connect for good'",

This is demonstrated by the way the GRCs align with our assets (see pages 12 to 13 ) and the strong synergies resulting from aligning risk management to our internal strategic framework and business\n\n## Emerging risk hubs\n\nWe define emerging risks as uncertainties that have the potential to be materially significant, but whose causes and impacts cannot be fully defined at present. These tend to have more external drivers and may manifest over longer time horizons. Some examples are also shown under each GRC in the next section.\n\nTo address the more ambiguous and cross-group impacting nature of emerging risks, we've developed a group of small cross-functional teams, or hubs, involving representatives from risk management, strategy, finance, operations, subject matter experts and representatives from relevant CFUs, TUs and CUs. These teams share intelligence, identify potential trade-offs or conflicts, and agree specific actions. Actions could include enhancing our preparedness, monitoring specific developments or investigating information gaps.\n\n## Joining the dots\n\nIt is essential that risks are owned and managed by those closest to the business operations and there is leadership accountability. As such, each CFU Leadership Team regularly brings together their risks for review, discussion, prioritisation, ownership and action.\n\nThese risks are then categorised by GRC to give a line of sight and enable broader themes and trends to be identified. This\n\n- planning and performance management processes. Strategy and risk management form a strong partnership to ensure information is shared and disseminated through the business in a joined-up way to have the greatest impact, management consideration and engagement while reducing duplication of effort.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- helps us join the dots and understand the potential overall impact and enable a consistent and coordinated response.\n\nTo help facilitate this dot joining, we have rolled out a new digital risk management tool which we call ARTEMIS. This provides real-time access to risk and assurance information and minimises our reporting burden so that we can focus on the right behaviours, have the right conversations and take the right actions.\n\nRisk management forms the foundation of trust which is fundamental to our ambition and strategy.'\n\n## Geopolitical uncertainty\n\nThe situation is dynamic and fast moving but the Russian invasion of Ukraine poses a serious threat to the global security order and liberal democracy. This raises and intensifies many specific areas of risk including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the safety and security of our colleagues in the region\n- \u00b7 the possibility that retaliatory cyber attacks could affect our networks and data, or those of our customers\n- \u00b7 the impact on our direct and indirect supply chain\n- \u00b7 the wider economic uncertainty, particularly on inflation and cost of living.\n\nAs well as standing up teams to manage the coordination of operational activities and ensure compliance with the new sanctions, the Executive Committee is meeting regularly to review potential second order and longer term impacts, agree policy positions and consider strategic issues.",

This section contains details of our compliance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in this area (our 'TCFD statement').\n\nAs a premium listed company, we're required to report under FCA Listing Rule LR 9.8.6(8) on our compliance with the TCFD framework on a 'comply or explain' basis. This year is the first year of mandatory disclosure, but we've been making voluntary statements since FY20.\n\nWe consider the climate-related financial disclosures that follow to be consistent with the TCFD framework and therefore compliant with Listing Rule 9.8.6(8), save for certain items which we summarise on page 68.\n\nWhere relevant our disclosures have taken into account TCFD guidance on materiality of information in regard to Strategy and Metrics and Targets\u00aa. Climate-related disclosures are integrated throughout the Annual Report, so in some areas we've crossreferenced to another section containing the relevant information.\n\n## Our climate change governance\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for how we identify and manage climaterelated risks, delegated to the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee which oversees our climate change strategy, programme and goals and is chaired by non-executive director Leena Nair.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Executive Committee sets operational strategy on climate change and sustainability and monitors the associated risks, supported by our digital impact and sustainability team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Group Environment Board manages day-to-day climate-related compliance and risk issues on behalf of the Executive Committee , reporting back regularly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on our climate governance on page 97 .\n\n## Risk management\n\n## A structured and consistent approach to risk management\n\nOur risk management framework helps us assess, manage, monitor and act on risks around us successfully delivering our strategic objectives.\n\nWe look at potential impacts using quantitative and qualitative measures. These include our revenues and market capitalisation, customer experience, stakeholder perception, and/or the amount of senior management time we have to divert to address an issue. This enables us to determine the relative materiality of a risk.\n\n## Identifying, assessing and integrating climate-related risks\n\nWe include risks around climate change in our risk management framework. We've included them in several GRCs, including service interruption (physical assets), supply management (supply chain) and stakeholder management (reputation). You can read more about these GRCs on pages 62, 65 and 58 respectively.\n\nWe regularly review and report on risks in each category. The Executive Committee and Audit & Risk Committee regularly review reports on risks in each GRC on a rotational basis. Our internal audit team assesses the effectiveness of our risk management and internal controls on a risk-assessed basis and report findings to the Audit & Risk Committee .\n\nThis year we brought in an external senior climate expert to discuss climate change with our senior management team. We also had a briefing session with a number of risk owners to deepen their understanding of climate change risks. The session was part of a risk 'hub' looking at the emerging climate-related risks and opportunities we could face and including the findings in our GRCs and advancing this work in the year ahead.\n\n## Managing the different risks of climate change\n\nDay-to-day, we manage climate-related risks in the parts of our business they might affect. As an example, BT Sourced carries out checks to measure suppliers' energy use and environmental impact. Deciding how to mitigate or control a risk depends on its impact and likelihood. So for example we're investing in flood defences because increased flooding could have a big effect on us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read more on our risk management framework on pages 55 to 57.",

This helps us adapt and reduce their impact on our business and value chain.\n\nOur medium-term horizon is aligned to our financial planning process, enabling us to invest in things like adopting electric vehicles into our fleet.\n\nOur long-term horizon ties into the investment timeframes for strategic assets like our networks. It also influences our strategy, targets and plans on how to respond to the bigger risks and bigger transition implications of climate change. We also undertake scenario planning for climate risks over longer timeframes up to 2050 and beyond.\n\nThere are a lot of physical and transition risks which could apply to us, which we track closely. Based on how we've responded to physical and transition risks we don't deem these risks to be material at present, but we keep this under review as part of our ongoing review and assessment of climate risks.\n\n## Embedding climate-related risks and opportunities into our strategy\n\nClimate is a core part of our strategic framework, covered in our 'Lead the way to a bright, sustainable future' pillar. Of course, external legal and regulatory changes play a part in our climate strategy - like phasing out new petrol and diesel vehicle sales in the UK.\n\nWe have some ambitious strategic and financial targets, all aiming to decarbonise our operations and value chain and ultimately reach net zero.\n\nWith Accenture, we published research which decouples ICT sector carbon emissions from expected growth in data traffic b . It also looked at opportunities for sustainable technologies to drive big cuts in other sectors' carbon footprints (which will be more critical than ever in the next decade).\n\nTo show our commitment to this, we set a new target to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of CO2e by 2030, based on shifting them to technologies like FTTP, 5G, cloud computing and IoT.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our climate strategy, see page 35.\n\n## Being resilient to climate-related risks\n\nWe use TCFD's different reference scenarios to review climate-related risks around transitioning to a lower-carbon economy and the physical impacts of climate change.\n\nOur analysis is based on a core scenario (2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C heating) that we think is most likely. We've also reviewed more extreme 'what if?' transition and physical scenarios (1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C heating) to assess the potential financial impact of climate change on us in 2030 and 2050 c .\n\n## Responding to our main physical risks\n\nFlooding: Last year we analysed possible risks from large-scale flooding at 150 business-critical sites (based on the Environment Agency's Extreme Flood Outline). In the scenarios we explored, potential financial impacts weren't material. This is due to the flood defence programme we've now completed in all large and critical sites that were classified as high-risk locations. We've invested around \u00a36m in these defences since the programme began.\n\nWe've made good progress in our understanding of - and action in response to - the main flood risks our business faces. This year, we continued to analyse the potential effects of flooding in our UK estate and in line with our future location strategy. We ran a pilot covering 27 operational sites, using additional flood risk data and across a number of heating scenarios to provide a more extreme view of potential flood impacts in 2030 and 2050 c .\n\nThe pilot tracked fluvial, pluvial and tidal risk. We tested the likelihood and severity of flooding based on single and combined causes (for example, river flooding with high levels of surface water from rainfall).\n\nThis method helped us to identify potential flood sources more precisely, and how they'd affect our building or asset. And that lets us target mitigation\n\nand maintenance activities, and plan our location strategy and future defence investments. We're going to extend this analysis to other critical sites over the next few years.\n\nHeat: In most scenarios in 2030 and 2050, the UK will see more extreme heat days. The risk of these days damaging our network sites is low - mainly because of the cooling system upgrades in our large metronode sites which enable the rooms to operate effectively in up to 45\u00b0C external temperatures. We expect this upgrades programme to cost around \u00a360m once complete.\n\nWe've also finished upgrades in our strategic data centres and are now doing the same at core mobile sites. So higher UK temperatures should not materially affect our repair or cooling costs.\n\nTo minimise the impact of global warming, all cooling plant installed within our exchanges is manufactured and tested to confirm it can operate effectively up to a 45\u00b0C ambient temperature. Since 2015, we've invested over \u00a3102m on cooling system upgrades for our exchanges, covering the remainder of the estate.\n\nThe new adiabatic units cool through fresh air and water evaporation, making us less reliant on refrigerant gases. They work best on the hottest days of the year - well suited to the rising ambient temperatures of different heating scenarios in 2030 and 2050.\n\nLonger term, our FTTP rollout and the closure of the PSTN network will mean fewer physical network sites. That cuts our exposure to physical climate change risks like flooding and hotter temperatures. But it does mean more customers and services going through fewer operational locations. Our flood and temperature mitigations reduce the risks associated with that. And because FTTP services are more 'passive' (with no electronics between exchanges and connected properties), we expect the rollout to reduce our exposure to climaterelated risks.\n\nOutside the UK, extreme weather could disrupt service and affect customers and colleagues in key operational sites. In particular, our India sites are still seeing high temperatures and instances of very heavy rainfall. There were no immediate impacts on office operations this year, but we'll continue to monitor the situation closely.",

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\n\nSupply chain: Our supply chain reaches nearly 100 countries. But most of our products' raw materials are concentrated in China - where flood risks are predicted to increase under future warming scenarios. This is a shared concern across our whole sector.\n\nWe monitor supply chain risks and try to minimise them. We use monitoring tools to identify environmental risks then map them to larger suppliers and up to four tiers down in our supply chain. Our supplier teams get alerts if we detect any potential issues. This can also inform any longer-term plans to diversify our supply base as we consider risks, such as flooding, heat and other weather-related threats.\n\n## Managing transition risks and reaching net zero\n\nWe face a number of risks relating to potential market, policy, regulatory and technological changes intended to transition society to a low carbon economy. Our new net zero targets - and supporting plans - aim to cut the potential impact of transition risks and support the UK's commitment to becoming a net zero economy by 2050. We're doing lots of different things to try and hit our new targets.\n\n100% renewable electricity: All our electricity worldwide is renewable a . We know there are risks from potential gaps in UK renewable electricity supply, as well as more energy market volatility (like we're seeing this year). Most of the electricity we use comes from green tariffs. But we're also taking steps to increase the amount of electricity we buy through longer-term power purchase agreements. These give us better pricing predictability and help to grow the overall supply of renewable electricity.\n\n## Developments in carbon offsetting:\n\nWe track developments and prices in the voluntary carbon offsets market to inform our strategy (especially for setting our net zero targets).\n\nMoving to a low carbon fleet: We're aiming to switch the majority of our fleet to run on electric or zero emissions by 2030, which forms part of our goal to reduce our carbon emissions intensity by 87% by end of March 2031 (a group KPI - see page 45 ). This reduces the risks associated with policies that aim to cut vehicle carbon emissions (like banning new UK petrol and diesel vehicle sales by 2030).\n\nThis year, Openreach grew its fleet of electric vehicles to over 1,000. Subsidies, and there being enough vehicles and charging points, are some of the barriers that we and other businesses face. Previously we stated the aim of switching a third of the fleet to electric vehicles by 2025. Due to these challenges, we're reviewing our short-term plans and the operational and financial implications, which may result in us procuring less electric vehicles over the next few years. We remain committed to our 2030 fleet plans and are partnering with other companies through EV100, the UK Electric Fleets Coalition (both led by the Climate Group) and the new Electric Vehicle Fleet Accelerator to advocate for progressive public policies to push the shift to electric.\n\nDecarbonising our buildings: This year, we continued our energy efficiency and workplace transformation programmes, with a move to fewer, more sustainable and efficient buildings. Longer term, FTTP migration will cut the number of operational buildings like exchanges that we'll need. These steps, together with our renewables commitments, lower risks around carbon pricing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details on our workplace transformation programmes, see page 25\n\n.\n\nHelping suppliers cut carbon: If suppliers don't reduce their emissions, they could pass on carbon costs to us by 2030 under a 2\u00b0C heating scenario (this is a risk for our whole sector). Our supply chain targets and procurement approach respond to this risk - see the progress against our strategic priorities section ( page 35 ) and stakeholder section ( page 39 ) for further details.\n\nWe'll keep monitoring possible carbon pricing risks and policy and regulation changes under our risk management framework. This helps us understand the effects of things like growing numbers of company net zero targets and actions taken by governments to cut carbon emissions.\n\nAs reported under the climate change strategy heading on page 67 , we also see opportunities to support customers to achieve their own transition to net zero by using our products and services.\n\n## Our targets, metrics and measurement\n\nThere are details of our climate-related targets, programmes and performance in the strategic progress section on page 35 . They form a core part of our strategy and risk management approach.\n\nDuring the year, we brought forward our net zero goal by 15 years. That means we'll be a net zero carbon emissions business by the end of March 2031 and net zero for our supply chain and customers by the end of March 2041.\n\nAs reported earlier on this page, we're reviewing our short-term plans on electric vehicles and will update on our climate transition plans in the year ahead. Because of these uncertainties, we're continuing to develop our interim targets, covering the short and medium term. We plan to include these within our climate transition plans and will provide an update in the TCFD disclosures we make in the Annual Report 2023.\n\nFive per cent of our annual bonus available to eligible managers is based on our science-based target to cut the carbon emissions intensity of our operations by 87% by the end of March 2031. Our Remuneration Committee determines whether this target has been met, based on input and recommendations from the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee.\n\nAnd our commitment to tackling climate change extends beyond BT Group.\n\nDuring the year, Standard Life (and its parent company Phoenix Group), which provides pension benefits to around 66,000 colleagues, announced ambitious new targets to cut the carbon emissions intensity of its \u00a3250bn investment portfolio by at least 50% by 2030.\n\nThe BT Pension Scheme, which runs our defined benefit scheme, has also set a goal of becoming net zero for its entire \u00a355bn portfolio by 2035. We continue to work with all our pensions schemes' trustees and providers as part of their transition towards sustainable investments.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the group.\n\nThe assessment has been based on the company's strategy, balance sheet and financing position, including our \u00a32.1bn undrawn committed borrowing facility which matures in March 2027, and the potential impact of 'Our principal risks and uncertainties' ( pages 58 to 65 ).\n\nThe Board has chosen to conduct its review for a period of five years to 31 March 2027. This is a change from the Annual Report 2021 where we performed a three-year review. The Board believe that this is an appropriate timeframe as it aligns with the primary focus of our business and financial planning.\n\nThe assessment of viability is based on our medium term plan which forecasts the group's profitability, cash flows and funding requirements, and is approved by the Board at the end of each year. The medium term plan is built from bottom-up forecasts of each of our CFUs, supplemented by items managed at a group level and assumptions such as macroeconomic activity and exchange rates. The performance of the group and our CFUs against these forecasts is monitored monthly and this is supplemented each quarter through a series of quarterly business reviews of each unit conducted by the chief executive and chief financial officer.\n\nBeyond our medium term plan horizon, the group also makes investments that have business cases covering a longer time period, such as our network investments. Significant capital expenditure investment cases are approved by the chief executive and, where appropriate, the Board, after taking into account longer-term risks and opportunities such as the economy, technology and regulation.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur medium term plan has been stress tested in a series of individual severe but plausible downside scenarios, each aligned to our group risk categories as set out on pages 58 to 65 . This was followed by stress testing our forecasts against a combined scenario of correlated risks using a stochastic model. Finally, we then identified several mitigations that could realistically be taken by the business to avoid or reduce the impact of the underlying risk.\n\n## Scenarios included in our combined severe but plausible stress test\n\nOur hypothetical combined downside scenario is based on a continued escalation of the current geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Russia triggering a severe split of the global economy resulting in several major events impacting BT Group:\n\n| Scenario                                  | Risk category                                           | Assumption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Prolonged  stagflation                    | Strategy, Technology  & Competition,  Financing, People | Driven by geopolitical factors and Covid-19  persistence, the UK and global markets  experience prolonged stagflation with assumed  0% UK and Global GDP growth and UK inflation  remaining above 10% over 5 years.

A class  action is subsequently filed against BT Group  which requires substantial compensation  payments.                                                                                                             |\n| Pension  deficit                          | Financing                                               | An increase in BT Group's funding obligations  due to a worsening of the BT Pension Scheme  (BTPS) deficit caused by a combination of  financial market volatility (e.g. fall in BTPS  assets) and/or deterioration of BT's covenant  to the BTPS (e.g. fall in EBITDA).                                    |\n\nWe have considered directly relevant mitigations that we would employ if these events occurred and included those impacts in our calculations.\n\nA summation of the full impact of each of the individual scenarios in this stress test would be an extremely unlikely outcome; therefore a stochastic model was used to develop a more realistic combined scenario with a 5% probability.\n\n## Result\n\nApplying our severe but plausible combined scenario with related mitigations indicates that BT Group would experience a liquidity shortage commencing in the third year. However, there are further mitigations, including planned debt issuance, that could be applied to reduce this liquidity shortage. We would need to adopt around twothirds of the mitigations we have identified to maintain positive cash flow over the full five-year period of the assessment.\n\nThe mitigations directly in our control primarily revolve around reducing cash outflow from the group. In addition, there are also several mitigations which are outside of our control like raising debt.\n\nThe Board believe that it is reasonable to expect that it could continue to access debt capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it falls due, or to renew our undrawn committed facility (which expires in March 2027, before the end of the viability period). If access to debt markets wasn't available, then equity capital markets would be considered as an alternative to raise funds.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five-year period of their assessment.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's governance letter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI would like to thank my predecessor, Sir Jan du Plessis, for the support and guidance he gave me before I became chairman on 1 December 2021.\n\nThe Board recognises the value of having strong corporate governance at the centre of our decision-making on how we generate long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders, including investors, colleagues, customers, regulators, suppliers, the Government and the communities in which we operate. A key area of focus for the Board is oversight of the execution of our transformation agenda, which seeks to create a simpler, more efficient and dynamic BT Group. Our colleagues and culture are integral to our ability to successfully deliver on this agenda and to the future success of the group. This year we launched 'Being trusted: our code', to guide colleagues into behaving in the right way, supporting our ambition to be the most trusted connector of people, devices and machines.\n\nThis corporate governance report sets out our approach to governance and how it supports our strategy, the Board and its committees' key focus areas during the year and the decisions we have made, whilst considering the interests of our stakeholders and our contribution to society.\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn addition to Jan's retirement from the Board on 30 November 2021, Mike Inglis stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM and Leena Nair will step down at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. I'd like to thank Mike and Leena for their contribution to the Board and to the BT Group. From the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, Sara Weller will succeed Leena as chair of the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee . The primary focus of the Nominations\n\n- Committee during 2021 has been the search for a new chairman, culminating in my appointment.\n\nAs part of ongoing succession planning and in light of the tenure of our longer serving non-executive directors and the changes to the Board over the last few years, I have undertaken a comprehensive review of the Board's composition in line with the group's strategy and the opportunities and challenges we face, to examine how we can strengthen the Board for the future (see page 86 ). Reflecting on this review and feedback from the FY22 Board and committee evaluation, it is recognised that we need to enhance the Board's technology and digital capabilities given the group's focus on digital and legacy platform transformation. We are therefore in the process of searching for additional non-executive directors, with at least one director with digital and technology capabilities and transformation expertise. Having a diverse Board, as set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy, is a priority and therefore, a key element of any search brief.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe development of a diverse and inclusive organisation is central to our people strategy and is embedded within the inclusive pillar of our Manifesto, which we launched in December 2021. The Board's commitment to diversity and inclusion and the related targets are set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy (see page 87 ). Our Board currently comprises 36% female directors, two directors from an ethnic minority background, and one who has a disability. The Board is cognisant that Leena's departure will reduce the female membership of the Board from 36% to 27%, which is below our own Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy targets.\n\nThis will be addressed as part of our search for additional non-executive directors as a priority and in any event within FY23.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nThe Board values its engagement with all our key stakeholders, including shareholders, and we continue to ensure that our mechanisms are effective in enabling the continuous flow of information between the Board, senior management and the wider organisation. Details of our engagement with stakeholders during the year and the impact of this engagement on the Board's decision-making process can be found on pages 36 to 41 and 80 to 81 and in our Section 172 statement on pages 82 and 83 .\n\nSince my appointment, I have met with a number of our top investors to gain an understanding of their views.\n\nThe first cohort of the Colleague Board has strengthened the voice of our colleagues at Board-level and provided the Board with valuable insights into colleague sentiment through Isabel Hudson in her role as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement. We built on this success and appointed the new cohort of members for their two-year term at the start of 2022 (see pages 80 and 81 ).\n\nWe have a diverse range of customers with different needs, and meeting these needs effectively is key to our success in delivering on our strategy, ambition and purpose (see pages 18 and 19 ). As part of our Board-level oversight of consumer fairness, from April 2021, the Board decided to widen the remit of the BT Compliance Committee to monitor how we are living up to the Consumer Fairness principles (see page 96 ).\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThis year, we undertook an internal Board and committee evaluation, the results of which demonstrate that the Board as a whole continues to be effective and seeks to constructively challenge and support management. We have agreed on a set of actions to strengthen how we operate for the future (see page 84 ).\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Board members and the Executive Committee for their warm welcome and efforts this year.\n\nAdam Crozier Chairman 11 May 2022",

The Board ensures that our culture is aligned with the group's purpose, values and strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on our purpose, values and strategy are on pages 18 and 19\n\nThe Board monitors the indicators of our culture through:\n\n- \u00b7 discussions with the chief executive\n- \u00b7 reports from the HR director, including progress on our people and cultural dashboard\n- \u00b7 insights from our annual Your Say colleague engagement survey\n- \u00b7 direct feedback and insights from our Colleague Board via our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement.\n\nMore information on the Colleague Board and how the Board is kept informed of colleague perspectives and the culture of the organisation can be found on pages 80 and 81 , and in the Strategic report on page 36 .\n\nThe Board also maintains oversight of the group's operations, performance and governance and compliance with statutory and regulatory obligations. It determines the group's risk appetite, ensures that we have robust systems of risk management and internal controls in place, and is responsible for ensuring that the group has an effective leadership team to efficiently execute the group's strategy.\n\nA number of key decisions and matters are reserved for the Board and are not delegated to any of the committees, the chief executive or management. These are set out in the matters reserved to the Board and are available on our website:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbt.com/governance\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nWe held nine scheduled Board meetings and two strategy meetings in FY22. The chairman (or his predecessor) also held private sessions with the non-executive directors during the year. The company secretary or her nominated delegate is secretary to the Board, and they attend all meetings and provide advice, guidance and support as required.\n\nBoard and committee members are provided with papers in advance of each meeting on a secure electronic portal. Directors are expected to attend Board and relevant committee meetings of which they are a member, unless prevented by prior commitments, illness or a conflict of interest. If a director is unable to attend a meeting, they usually give their comments to the chairman or the committee chair in advance so that these can be duly considered as part of the discussion at the meeting.\n\nAs a result of the continuing Covid-19 pandemic, some Board and committee meetings during the year were held remotely by video conference or took place as hybrid meetings. These meetings were organised to allow us to maintain constructive levels of engagement and discussion, to challenge management and have robust debates as part of decision-making.\n\nIn light of changing restrictions, the Board was able to resume pre-Board dinners as part of informal interactions and also had the opportunity to meet colleagues across different levels of the organisation during its offsite visit to our Birmingham Snowhill office in September 2021.\n\n|                                      | Meetings  attended   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Adam Crozier (chairman) a            | 4/4                  |\n| Jan du Plessis (previous chairman) b | 6/6                  |\n| Philip Jansen                        | 9/9                  |\n| Simon Lowth                          | 9/9                  |\n| Adel Al-Saleh                        | 9/9                  |\n| Ian Cheshire                         | 9/9                  |\n| Iain Conn                            | 9/9                  |\n| Isabel Hudson c                      | 8/9                  |\n| Mike Inglis d                        | 3/3                  |\n| Matthew Key                          | 9/9                  |\n| Allison Kirkby                       | 9/9                  |\n| Leena Nair e                         | 7/9                  |\n| Sara Weller f                        | 8/9                  |\n\n- a  Adam joined the Board as a non-executive director and chairman designate on 1 November 2021 and became chairman on 1 December 2021.\n- b  Jan stepped down from the Board as chairman and a director on 30 November 2021.\n- c  Isabel gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n- d  Mike stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on 15 July 2021.\n- e  Leena gave apologies for two meetings during the year due to other business commitments.\n- f  Sara gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to illness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Section 172 statement and stakeholders\n\nThe Board focus in FY22 section set out on the following pages includes our Section 172 statement on pages 82 and 83 .\n\nOur Section 172 statement demonstrates our directors' regard to the matters in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (2006 Act) in performing their duties.\n\nSee the Strategic report on pages 36 to 41 for additional details of how we engage with our key stakeholders.\n\nThe Board and each of its committees always have regard to wider stakeholder interests including and beyond those of our shareholders as part of discussions and decision-making.

Each of the committees also monitored areas within their remit that are important indicators of the group's culture, on which the Board is updated by the committee chairs.

During the year, the Board had particular regard to the long-term success of the group in its discussions on group strategy (see page 77 ). Our purpose and strategy demonstrate how we will realise our ambition and grow value for all our stakeholders. This in turn guides the Board's decisions, specifically the balance between short and long-term investments. The third pillar of our strategy (lead the way to a bright, sustainable future) incorporates our aim to identify and develop new business opportunities that will help us grow sustainably in the future. More information on our strategy can be found from pages 18 and 19 .\n\n## The impact of the group's operations on the community and environment:\n\nThe Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee reviewed and endorsed the Manifesto for a bright, sustainable future, which aims to accelerate growth through technology that's responsible, inclusive and sustainable, ensuring the group can continue to build trust and create value for its stakeholders. The committee also monitors progress on the digital impact and sustainability strategy and oversees the progress of our related goals, including those in respect of climate and the environment. In line with the ambitions we have in this area, the committee approved the acceleration of BT Group's net zero target for its own operations from 2045 to the end of March 2031 and a new net zero target for supply chain and customer emissions to be achieved by the end of March 2041.\n\nFor more information on this see page 45\n\n.\n\nInformation as to how we have addressed the recommendations of the TCFD framework can be found on pages 66 to 69.\n\n## The desirability to maintain a reputation for high standards of business conduct:\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for setting and monitoring the culture, values and reputation of the group. Our colleagues are central to us achieving our ambition and we are building a culture where our colleagues can be their best. During the year, the Board considered the group's culture in its decision-making and discussions; further details on this can be found on pages 76 and 78 .\n\nDuring the year, we launched 'Being trusted: our code' which sets out the principles of how we expect our colleagues, and anyone who represents or works with the group, to behave, do business and connect for good. It demonstrates our commitment to high standards of business conduct, directly links with BT Group's purpose: we connect for good, and aims to support our ambition to be the world's most trusted connector of people, devices and machines. It provides a guide to ensure colleagues live up to our values, set highest standards, meet legal and regulatory obligations, create the fairest environment, and welcome, respect and hear diverse opinions. The new code was discussed with the Audit & Risk Committee ahead of launch.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation on 'Being trusted: our code' can be found on page 18 and at bt.com/ethics\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also considered regular reports from the ethics and compliance director on our ethics and compliance policies and programmes and reports on issues raised through Speak Up, BT Group's confidential, whistleblowing hotline (see page 93 ).\n\n## The interests of our colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with our key stakeholders:\n\nThe Board and its committees understand the strategic importance of stakeholders to our business. When making decisions, the directors have regard to the interests of colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with other key stakeholders. We acknowledge that not every decision we make will necessarily result in a positive outcome for all our stakeholders, so the Board must balance competing interests in reaching its decisions.\n\nWhile the Board engages directly with stakeholders on some issues, the size and distribution of the BT Group and our stakeholder groups means that stakeholder engagement often happens below Board-level. However, the Board considers information from across the organisation to help it understand how our operations affect our stakeholders' interests and views.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- More details on how we engage with key stakeholders (including customers and suppliers) on pages 36 to 41 .\n\nOur colleagues are key to our success, and they are always considered as part of the Board's discussions and decisionmaking. The Board and its committees have considered colleague wellbeing, our diversity and inclusion ambitions, organisational culture and the impact of our transformation programme on them, as well as on employee relations (see page 78 for more details). The Board engages with colleagues primarily through the Colleague Board and through our designated non-executive director for workforce engagement (see pages 80 and 81 ). In this role, Isabel provides feedback after each formal Colleague Board meeting and also discusses any topics raised by members at relevant Board and committee meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther colleague engagement channels are set out on page 36 .\n\n## The need to act fairly as between BT Group's shareholders:\n\nDuring FY22, the chairman, chief executive, chief financial officer, other executives and the investor relations team held various meetings with investors (see page 38 for more detail on our engagement with shareholders).

Discovery,  Inc. bringing together the  sports content offering of  both BT Sport and Eurosport  In line with our announcement in April 2021 and in light of our broader strategy, the Board with management  considered a number of different options for the future of BT Sport, and the key opportunities and risks of each  of these, as well as the financial implications and the impact on key stakeholders, including our customers,  investors and colleagues. As part of this, it also explored a number of strategic partners during the year, to  consider ways to generate investment and strengthen our sports business, to help take it to the next stage in its  growth. Accordingly, the Board recognised the benefits that a 50:50 joint venture company with Warner Bros.

The Board reviewed potential outcomes in the context of our overall business objectives and both the current  and expected future regulatory and legislative environment. The Board considered the expected deficit,  associated deficit recovery payments and details of how the previously endorsed asset-backed finance structure  and co-investment vehicle arrangements are expected to be used, and the impact of this on our stakeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Outsourcing and partnering  arrangement with Rackspace  The Board considered the proposal to enter into an outsourcing and partnering arrangement with Rackspace  Technology, Inc. The benefits and the risks of the arrangement within the context of the hybrid cloud market  and alignment with our broader strategy and transformation plans were discussed. In approving the decision,  the Board also reviewed the impact of the proposed arrangement on colleagues, customers, communities and  shareholders, as well as on our key financial metrics. It recognised that this would offer enhanced capabilities,  products and expertise to meet our customers' business needs, as well as providing an improved digital                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Funding of our increased and  accelerated FTTP build plan  from 20m to 25m premises by  Over the last few years, the Board has held a number of in-depth discussions with management on the level and  pace of our full fibre build and the advantages and disadvantages of accelerating this with a particular focus on  our ability to fund the related large capital expenditure investment, the regulatory framework and the impact of  this on our stakeholders.

Given an external evaluation was completed in FY21, we undertook an internal evaluation in FY22.\n\n## Process\n\nTailored questionnaires were circulated to members and attendees of the Board and each of its committees. The evaluations focused on composition, succession and how well-placed the Board is to add value to the business, in terms of how it oversees strategy, risk management, people, culture and performance. Focus was also given to the Board's decisionmaking processes, as well as how well it considers stakeholders as part of its decisions and discussions.\n\nGiven the recent appointment of the chairman, he held individual discussions with each director to understand their views on the workings of the Board and Executive Committee , their relationship with management, the organisation and how effectively they feel they are contributing and are supported as individual directors. The senior independent director undertook a discussion with the full Board (without the chairman) and the company secretary on initial views of the new chairman. The non-executive directors also reviewed the performance\n\nof the chief executive during the year.\n\n## Agreed areas of focus and actions\n\nOverall, the Board and its committees are considered to be effective. There were certain areas of focus which the Board felt would continue to improve its performance and effectiveness.

Any member unable to attend a meeting held a separate meeting with Iain.\n\n## Meetings attended\n\n| Adam Crozier (chair) a   | 3/3   | Mike Inglis c   | 5/5   |\n|--------------------------|-------|-----------------|-------|\n| Jan du Plessis b         | 3/3   | Matthew Key     | 5/5   |\n| Adel Al-Saleh            | 5/5   | Allison Kirkby  | 5/5   |\n| Ian Cheshire             | 5/5   | Leena Nair      | 5/5   |\n| Iain Conn                | 5/5   | Sara Weller     | 5/5   |\n| Isabel Hudson            | 5/5   |                 |       |\n\n- a  Adam became a member on 1 November 2021 and committee chair on 1 December 2021.\n- b  Jan stepped down from the Board and the committee on 30 November 2021.\n- c  Mike stepped down from the Board and the committee at the conclusion of the AGM on 15 July 2021.\n\nAfter each meeting, the chair reported back to the Board on the committee's activities.\n\n## Board succession and appointments\n\nThe committee focused on searching for a new chairman which ultimately culminated in my appointment.\n\n## Chairman: search and appointment\n\nFurther to the announcement last March of Jan du Plessis' intention to retire from the Board, we commenced an appointment process to find a successor.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIain Conn, our senior independent director, led the search process and chaired the committee meetings in relation to this. Jan recused himself from these discussions and Ian Cheshire, who had expressed an interest in being considered as a potential candidate for the role, was also not present.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAfter a formal tender process for a search agency, MWM Consulting, an independent external search agency, who has no other connection to the BT Group, or any of the directors, was appointed to facilitate the process. MWM Consulting is a signatory of the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms (in line with our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIain engaged with a number of our major shareholders on their views on the type of candidate we should consider. Further to a committee discussion on the capabilities, skills and experience required, and having considered the future needs of the business and the feedback from investors, a search brief was agreed. In line with that brief, MWM Consulting prepared a longlist of candidates and was specifically requested by the committee to ensure that it comprised a diverse range of candidates including female candidates and those from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee agreed a shortlist of candidates who were formally approached by MWM Consulting for consideration of the role and assessment. Further to a comprehensive assessment and interview process, feedback was discussed by the committee at each stage to shortlist candidates based on the relative criteria and brief. The committee challenged itself throughout the process on ensuring it continued to think about a diverse range of candidates for the role.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee subsequently identified Adam Crozier as the preferred candidate to chair the BT Group given his significant operational and transformational experience in both public and private businesses across a range of industries, leading public company boards, developing teams and managing stakeholders. Further to the committee's recommendation, the Board appointed Adam as an independent non-executive director and chairman designate with effect from 1 November 2021 and as chairman with effect from 1 December 2021. Adam was judged to be independent on appointment.\n\nGiven the tenure of longer serving directors and Board changes over the last couple of years, the committee's focus for the year ahead is on searching for additional non-executive directors. It has engaged an independent, external search consultant to assist with this. Accordingly, the committee, on behalf of the",

        "page_content": "Board, has carried out a comprehensive review of the skills, experience and diversity needed on the Board, in line with the group's strategy and the opportunities and challenges we face, as well as the experience needed for the succession planning of key roles. Reflecting on feedback from the FY22 evaluation and this review, it is recognised that we need to enhance the Board's technology and digital capabilities given the group's focus on digital and legacy platform transformation. We are therefore in the process of searching for additional non-executive directors, with at least one director with digital and technology capabilities and transformation expertise. As part of these searches (and any new director searches), diversity is a key consideration. Our external search consultants are asked to ensure they produce diverse candidate longlists, with a particular focus on gender and ethnicity, and work with us to appoint directors that meet the aims and targets of our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOn accepting their appointment, directors must confirm they are able to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and any committees of which they are members, as well as the AGM and Board offsites. Directors are also expected to devote sufficient time to prepare for each meeting and to participate in other site or office visits to understand the business better. Before accepting new external appointments, directors are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board.\n\nBefore recommending the Board approve the appointment of Adam Crozier as chairman, the committee considered Adam's other commitments and whether he would be able to allocate sufficient time to the role. This was also discussed with Adam. Adam advised that he planned to step down as chairman of ASOS (in November 2021) and as a non-executive director of Sony Corporation (in December 2021). He would remain as chair of Kantar and Whitbread and the committee was comfortable that these positions would not be detrimental to his ability to perform his duties as chairman of BT Group. Adam has already spent significant time outside of the scheduled Board and committee meetings in his first few months familiarising himself with the group and the business as well as meeting with management and our stakeholders to understand their views. The Board is satisfied with the time he is dedicating to the role and this will continue to be kept under review by the senior independent director as part of the review of the chairman.\n\nAhead of Ian Cheshire becoming chair of Channel 4 in April 2022, the Board considered the proposed appointment in line with the time commitment required for BT Group and Ian's other roles. On balance, the Board felt this would not be detrimental to his ability to perform his duties as a non-executive director of BT Group.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nThe committee considered, in respect of each director, their skills and experience, time commitment and tenure as part of its recommendation to the Board in relation to the directors put forward for election and re-election. The Board believes that each director it has recommended to shareholders for election or re-election at the 2022 AGM brings considerable knowledge, wide-ranging skills and experience to the Board, makes an effective and valuable contribution and continues to demonstrate commitment to their role.\n\nOn recommendation from the committee, the Board also considered the continued independence of non-executive directors as part of its consideration of the re-election recommendations. The Board continues to consider all non-\n\nexecutive directors as being independent in line with the Code, with the exception of Deutsche Telekom's nominated representative. The chairman was judged to be independent at the time of his appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of directors' contracts or letters of appointment are in the Annual remuneration report on page 111\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our approach to diversity on the Board and our aim to have a well-balanced Board with the appropriate skills, knowledge, experience and diversity to meet our business needs and support our strategic aim of building the strongest foundations (see bt.com/ governance). In light of recent publications and the changes to the Listing Rules, we will review and update this policy during FY23, but we are already considering how we will meet our targets as part of current director searches. The policy ensures we:\n\n- \u00b7 apply an inclusion lens to all our decision-making processes\n- \u00b7 monitor the impact of our decisions on diverse populations\n- \u00b7 value and communicate the benefits that difference brings and are unapologetic in our pursuit of a diverse workforce at all levels\n- \u00b7 actively seek out opportunities across the business to enhance and strengthen our approach to inclusion.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, in line with our current target, four of our 11 Board directors were female (36%) and two directors were from an ethnic minority background (18%), and in addition, one director has a disability. Whilst we appoint candidates based on merit, we continue to challenge our external search consultants to ensure that all forms of diversity, in particular ethnicity and gender, are considered when drawing up candidate lists and this is a key consideration for our current searches. The Board is cognisant that Leena's departure from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM will reduce the female membership of the Board from 36% to 27%, which is below our own Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy targets and other external expectations. The diversity of the Board will be addressed as a priority as part of our search for additional non-executive directors.\n\nDiversity is considered in the broadest sense and all forms of difference are considered, including age, gender, nationality, independence, professional background, social and ethnic backgrounds, business and geographic experience, as well as cognitive and personal strengths. These are considered in reviewing the composition of the Board, and where possible, are appropriately balanced. We believe a key driver in delivering our diversity commitments across the organisation is through a Board which has this balance of skills, experience, diversity and knowledge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of our diversity and inclusion strategy, including its objectives, link to strategy, implementation and progress can be found on page 24\n\n## Training and development\n\nThe chairman and the company secretary keep the training and development needs of directors under review. Non-executive directors meet with management, enhancing their understanding of the business through briefing sessions. We encourage all directors to keep their skills and knowledge up-to-date and to ask for any support they need. As part of ongoing development, the company secretary (or her delegate) briefs the Board and its committees at each respective meeting, as relevant, on any key legal, regulatory and corporate",

During the year, these briefings included updates on the institutional investor guidelines, environmental, social and governance considerations and governance publications. Directors are updated as required on developments in the environment in which the business operates and internal and external advisers are invited to meetings to provide updates as necessary, for example during the year an update was provided on the Health and Safety legislation and directors' responsibilities thereunder and the National Security and Investment Act 2021.\n\nEach director may obtain independent professional advice at the group's expense as required. The Board and each committee are supported by the company secretary and her team, and they are available to all directors to provide advice and support.\n\n## Openreach Limited board succession\n\nUnder its remit, the committee has a responsibility to consider changes to the Openreach Limited board and recommend any changes to the BT Group Board for approval. Given Liz Benison's indication of her intention to step down from the Openreach Limited Board in 2022, a search for her successor was commenced. In March 2022, the proposed appointment of Natalie Ceeney effective as of 1 May 2022 was considered by the committee and subsequently recommended to the Board for approval.\n\n## Executive Committee succession planning and talent\n\nThroughout the year, the committee has kept under review:\n\n- \u00b7 the performance and succession planning of Executive Committee members. In particular, the committee discussed with the chief executive potential successor candidates to the HR director. Given the transformation and people agenda, and the group's key priorities, the committee considered the impact of the different options on the organisation and its stakeholders, and which candidate would best support this. After careful consideration, the committee approved the appointment of Debbie White as the interim HR director. The committee continues to focus on the search for a permanent HR director and broader Executive Committee succession planning, including having oversight of the talent pipeline with a focus on diversity\n- \u00b7 key talent at senior leadership level. The committee reflected on the importance of identifying critical roles and building stronger diversity of experience, gender and ethnicity, as well as commercial, technology and transformation capabilities, both through potential external candidates and through our internal talent pipeline\n- \u00b7 the external appointments of Executive Committee members, in line with our policy on external interests for Executive Committee members (including executive directors) and the CEO, Openreach. Under this policy, proposed external directorships and other significant external interests must not be to an organisation that is a BT Group competitor/major supplier to BT Group, create a conflict of interest for the individual with their role at BT Group, involve significant amounts of BT Group working hours or impede the ability of the individual to perform their BT Group role, or involve disproportionate incentives or remuneration, with reference to the time commitment of the role. Any fees or other incentives arising from such appointments may be retained by the individual, subject to the amount being proportionate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman\n\n(independent on appointment)\n\nNon-independent\n\nexecutive director\n\nNon-independent,\n\nnon-executive director\n\nIndependent\n\nnon-executive director\n\nD\n\nE\n\nE\n\n## Executive Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(including CEO, Openreach and executive directors on the Board)\n\nAs at 31 March 2022\n\n8 (73%)\n\n3 (27%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Committee , company secretary and direct reports (including CEO, Openreach and excluding executive directors on the Board)\n\nAs at 31 March 2022\n\n75 (69%)  34 (31%)",

Following this review and a discussion of the sensitivities, it confirmed that the going concern basis of accounting continues to be an appropriate basis of preparation for the financial statements and recommended it for approval by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 115\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe committee assessed the process and assessment of the group's prospects, the time horizon and how this aligned with the group's long-term forecasts, taking into account the group's current position and principal risks. The committee also considered the group risks in management's stress testing model, including the review of downside scenarios and a combined 'severe but plausible' scenario where multiple inter-connected risks materialise. The committee was satisfied that the viability statement could be provided and endorsed the selection of a five-year time horizon as a basis for the statement and the approach to its development, and recommended it for approval by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 70\n\n## Regulatory financial reporting\n\nThe committee supported the processes and systems enhancements that were implemented to ensure that the group met its 2021 regulatory financial reporting obligations.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe committee considered the assumptions underlying the valuation of the pension assets and liabilities in the financial statements, as summarised in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, the sensitivities around the assumptions and the impact of the assumptions on the balance sheet, income statement and related disclosures. In May 2021, the committee was updated on the triennial funding valuation for BTPS, the possible range of valuation outcomes and our funding position ahead of the Board's approval of the funding valuation.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nThe committee received and discussed the key assumptions, including operating cash flow forecasts, resulting headroom and the sensitivity analysis performed by management. The committee considered and was satisfied with the key assumptions and agreed that no goodwill impairment charges were required for FY22.\n\n## Major contracts\n\nThe performance of major contracts in Enterprise and Global were considered, including accounting judgements, assessments of the recoverability of dedicated contract assets, and any requirement for loss provisions.\n\n## Asset verification and asset lives\n\nThe committee assessed the results of management's annual asset life review, asset verification exercise and review of fully depreciated assets. The committee was satisfied that the judgements made, and the methodology applied, were appropriate.\n\n## Divestments\n\nThe committee reviewed the judgements made in relation to the group's divestments, including on whether the held for sale criteria had been satisfied, the judgements involved in accounting for the BT Sport 50:50 joint venture, disclosed as a post balance sheet event, and how goodwill should be allocated to divested or held for sale entities.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe committee reviewed specific items quarterly, and considered and agreed that they were appropriately categorised. It also considered management's view of the quality of earnings and of the effective tax rate. At each quarter, it considered a detailed assessment of provisions, and the committee was satisfied with the analysis provided in relation to the results.\n\n## Finance transformation\n\nThroughout the year, the committee was regularly updated on the implementation of a new central finance system and group accounting book of record and considered in particular the impact on published financial information and the group's control environment.\n\n## FRC review\n\nIn February 2022, the Corporate Reporting Review department of the FRC advised that our Annual Report 2021 had been subject to its review. It did not raise any questions or queries on our accounts. It did note a number of matters where it believed that users of the accounts would benefit from improvements to our existing disclosures. This feedback has been reflected within this Annual Report. The FRC review does not provide any assurance that the Annual Report are correct in all material respects; the FRC's role is not to verify the information provided, but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control continued\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee chair's report continued\n\n## Risk management and internal controls systems\n\nThe group has enhanced its framework of risk management, controls and assurance for dealing with its landscape of risks. This framework provides the tools to enable us to be smart with risk and improve operational and ethical discipline. The risk management processes identify and monitor the risks facing the group and the risk landscape is divided into areas of enduring risk called GRCs, which cover strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on our risk management framework and principal risks can be found on pages 55 to 65\n\nManagement continues to build a more robust controls landscape through the ongoing finance transformation programme, and a rigorous financial controls assurance approach has been followed in line with previous years. Management has undertaken testing of the design and implementation of all key financial controls and effective reliance on the systems tested was confirmed.\n\nIn line with the Code, the Board monitored the effectiveness of the group's systems of risk management and internal controls through detailed reviews of the GRCs and consideration of reports from management, as well as from internal audit and other assurance functions. Much of this work was undertaken by this committee on the Board's behalf. Given that the Board is ultimately responsible for the group's systems of risk management and internal controls, as chair, I subsequently reported the key matters from each of these sessions to the Board.\n\nThe activities listed below collectively enable the committee to confirm that the group's systems of risk management and internal controls have been appropriately reviewed. The committee considered these systems throughout the year. Where required, it proactively discussed the suggested improvement actions and monitored their progress. Further information on improvements being made to the overall risk management framework, as well as specific actions taken to manage our principal risks can be found on pages 55 to 57 .\n\nIn addition to the significant improvements in the 'wiring' of our approach to risk and control, the committee discussed the improvements made to the risk and control 'mindset' across the group. Led by the chief executive, programmes to improve operational integrity - robust operations and smart decisions in an ethical way - are aimed at improving our management of risk at all levels. These programmes aim to make our requirements simpler, ensure colleagues hold themselves and others to account, listen for initial signals of emerging problems, and think smartly through potential consequences when making decisions.\n\n## Activities carried out during the year:\n\nThe committee held open and honest discussions on the GRCs with the Executive Committee risk owners to understand current and anticipated risk developments, and reviewed how effectively the risks are being mitigated and managed. It considered the definition of risk appetite and supporting metrics within the GRCs, the effectiveness of the controls, mitigation activities and any areas for improvement. The committee robustly assessed both current, specific concerns (point risks) and uncertainties that may materialise in the future (emerging risks), particularly as a consequence of adverse changes to the economic, social, regulatory, political or technology environment, or as an unintended consequence of new products and services being offered or developed by the group. The committee agreed with management any actions required to\n\nmanage or mitigate these risks effectively. The committee oversaw the preparations required to ensure compliance ahead of the launch of the group's hardware financing offering. It discussed the systems, processes, controls and capabilities in place to ensure the necessary assurances ahead of the go live. The committee considered the go/no go criteria, reviewed and assured by an independent third party and internal audit and was comfortable that the criteria had been met, subsequently approving proceeding to launch.\n\nGiven the legal and security risks associated with the data we manage, the importance to our colleagues, customers and the group's ambition, as well as the ever-increasing regulatory scrutiny in this space, the committee has received a number of updates on the management of this GRC, and monitored progress against any agreed enhancements.\n\nThe committee continues to monitor cyber security risk closely. An independent strategic cyber security assessment has been undertaken, as well as a separate external review of our security strategy. A cyber security remediation plan has also been established which has identified key initiatives required to achieve risk appetite targets.\n\nThe committee considered management's approach to managing emerging risks within the risk management framework and in each of the GRCs. The committee held in-depth discussions on the emerging risk profile and landscape, particularly the key disruptive technology-related emerging risks. In addition, with the CFU CEOs, the committee now undertakes unit risk reviews, which cover how the GRCs are being managed in the respective units, and the significant point and emerging risks. In FY22, we commenced with a review of the Enterprise unit.\n\nIn addition, the committee monitored the operation of management's assurance approach to internal controls over financial reporting (ICOFR) and considered the implications of management's conclusions for the purposes of the preparation of the Annual Report 2022. The committee was satisfied that the necessary ICOFR testing had been carried out, and that any related control deficiencies identified were appropriately addressed, or are in the process of being addressed.\n\nThe committee continued to monitor the finance transformation programme which supports the ongoing improvement of controls identified through management's testing and compliance monitoring programme. The committee received updates on the progress of the execution of the programme, which aims to deliver a more automated, preventative controls environment over the medium term. Ahead of the committee's endorsement of the go-live, the committee considered how the specific go-live criteria and programme governance processes were met.\n\nThe committee also monitors the outcome of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation paper and how this may impact our current controls development strategy.",

The committee discussed its background and purpose ahead of launch. 'Being trusted: our code' demonstrates our commitment to high standards of business conduct. It provides a set of statements and promises about what it means to be part of the group, covering how we treat our colleagues, customers, suppliers, and our responsibilities in respect of meeting our legal and regulatory obligations especially in respect of data privacy and security, finance, the environment and the responsible use of technology and setting high standards of operational integrity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on this can be found on page 18\n\n## bt.com/ethics\n\nThe committee considered regular reports on our ethics and compliance policies, and programmes and related learnings and culture. It spent time discussing the enhancement programme in relation to international trade, anti-bribery and corruption, as well as communications regulation compliance in line with the respective GRC.\n\nEach quarter, the committee received and considered reports on issues raised through Speak Up, BT Group's confidential, whistleblowing services operated by an independent company, 24 hours a day, in multiple languages, for both written and telephone reports. The committee ensures that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of these and other matters via the ethics and compliance team. The procedures for Speak Up are reviewed annually with input from the specialists in Speak Up, HR and legal, to ensure best practice is maintained and that procedures remain compliant. On receipt, any whistleblowing reports are triaged by specialist resource, assigned a priority and, where appropriate, are directed to an investigator from security, HR or legal with appropriate assistance from subject matter experts and/or independent line management. On completion of any investigation, the Speak Up team ensures the investigation has been thorough and fair. High priority cases are reviewed by a multi-disciplinary panel for completeness before closure. The committee discussed any themes identified across the cases received, the outcomes of these cases and the overall rates of substantiation. The committee was also kept up to date on the introduction of a new HR helpline to enable colleagues to access 'in the moment' assistance with any issues.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nInternal audit provides independent, objective and timely assurance to senior management and the Board, through this committee, over the design and operational effectiveness of key processes and controls that manage the risks across the organisation.\n\nDuring the year, the committee:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed and approved the group internal audit annual plan, ensuring it aligned to the principal risks of the business\n- \u00b7 reviewed and, taking into account the current needs of the group, approved the internal audit charter, which establishes internal audit's independence, authority, remit and reporting lines to conduct its work\n- \u00b7 received regular reports from internal audit on its activities and progress against the group internal audit plan, allowing the committee to monitor delivery against the plan\n- \u00b7 held in-depth discussions with management on all internal audit reports where controls were assessed as 'inadequate', and action plans to address these. The actions were tracked by the committee, including the responsiveness of management to the findings and recommendations, and the progress of closing any overdue actions.\n\nDuring the year, the committee carried out its annual assessment of the performance and effectiveness of internal audit, including whether the activities, structure, expertise, objectivity and quality of the function were appropriate for the business. The committee concluded that internal audit continues to add value in the context of the group's overall assurance framework. An external effectiveness review of internal audit was previously conducted in FY19 by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors in accordance with our five-year cycle of such reviews.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control continued\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee chair's report continued\n\n## External audit\n\nThe committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the reappointment of the external auditor, determining their independence from the group and its management and agreeing the scope and fee for the audit. Following its review of KPMG's performance, the committee concluded that the reappointment of KPMG should be recommended to shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n\nFollowing the audit tender in FY17, KPMG was appointed as BT Group's external auditor from the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. The FY22 audit is KPMG's fourth audit of BT Group. John Luke was appointed as the KPMG lead audit partner for the BT Group in FY21, having been the audit partner for Openreach Limited since FY19. Recognising the rotational requirements for the lead audit partner and taking into account both his tenure at Openreach and BT Group, FY23 will be John Luke's final year as lead audit partner. The committee chair has discussed John Luke's succession with the chief executive of KPMG in the UK, and the committee is currently reviewing potential candidates put forward by KPMG to succeed John and to ensure a smooth handover.\n\nDuring the year, the committee:\n\n- \u00b7 considered and approved the proposed external audit fees for the year ended 31 March 2022, as well as the recurring audit fee for the regulatory financial statements and the interim review fee (see the Independent auditor's report on pages 122 to 128 for more details)\n- \u00b7 reviewed with the external auditor, and subsequently approved, the external auditor's scope of work, audit plan and strategy for FY22\n- \u00b7 approved the engagement letter of the external auditor\n- \u00b7 recommended approval by the Board of management's letters of representation\n- \u00b7 reviewed the annual findings of the FRC's Audit Quality Review in respect of KPMG's audits. The committee discussed the findings and the applicability to the BT Group and are discussing this further with KPMG.\n\nAs part of my year-end report to the Board, I informed the Board of the outcome of the external audit.\n\nBT Group confirms that it complies with the EU Regulation on Audit Reform and the Competition and Markets Authority's Statutory Audit Services Order with regard to mandatory auditor rotation and tendering.\n\n## Independence and non-audit services\n\nThe committee discussed the external auditor's independence and potential areas that could give rise to a conflict of interest, and considered the safeguards in place to prevent compromising their independence and objectivity. BT Group's non-audit services policy sets out the non-audit services that can be provided by the external auditor, in line with the latest ethical standards. The external auditor is not permitted to perform any work which they may later be required to audit, or which might affect their objectivity and independence, or create a conflict of interest. Internal procedures describe the approval process for work performed by the external auditor, and these applied to KPMG throughout the year. The committee monitored compliance with the policies and procedures and considered business relationships with the external auditor, and the level and appropriateness of non-audit services and fees. The committee will continue to keep under review BT Group's non-audit services policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur non-audit services policy can be found at bt.com/governance\n\nThe committee reviewed the confirmation and information received from the external auditor on the arrangements that it has in place to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, which are consistent with the ethical standards published by the FRC, including specific safeguards where they provide permissible non-audit services to the group. The nature of the non-audit services carried out by the external auditor during the year are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page 146 . These were carried out due to either legal or regulatory obligations, contractual requirements, or represented areas of assurance work where it was materially more efficient for the external auditor to be engaged, as opposed to another third party due to the work completed in relation to the audit, and which were permitted to be performed by an auditor under the Revised Ethical Standard 2019. Audit-related assurance services, including the audit of the regulatory financial statements, as well as any approved non-audit services performed by KPMG, are considered a low threat to auditor independence. The largest non-audit service included work auditing BT Sport's carved out financial statements. This work fell within the scope of limited permissible services, which are closely related to existing audit work that KPMG provide. The proportion of other non-audit services to total services carried out by the external auditor is therefore considered the most suitable measure of the non-audit services provided. These represented 0.6% of the total fees (FY21: 0.8%).",

The deputy company secretary or her appointed delegate acts as secretary to the committee, and they attend all meetings and provide advice, guidance and support as required.\n\nThe chairman, chief executive, group HR director and director of reward are typically invited to attend meetings. They do not attend meetings where their own remuneration is discussed or in other circumstances where their attendance would not be appropriate.\n\nDeloitte LLP, as the independent remuneration adviser to the committee, also attends all meetings.\n\nThe committee held five scheduled meetings during the year and three ad hoc meetings. The ad hoc meetings have predominantly been focused on remuneration arrangements for the Executive Committee .\n\n## Meetings attended\n\nIan Cheshire (chair)\n\n5/5\n\nIain Conn\n\n5/5\n\nIsabel Hudson a\n\n4/5\n\nMatthew Key\n\n5/5\n\nLeena Nair b\n\n4/5\n\n- a  Isabel gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n- b  Leena gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has recognised the hard work and dedication of our workforce and how that has enabled us to continue to deliver for the country. We've have continued to ensure that any remuneration decisions taken during the year were in line with our Directors' Remuneration Policy.'\n\n## Committee role\n\n- \u00b7 Determines the salary and benefits for the chairman, executive directors, members of the Executive Committee including the company secretary, and monitors remuneration practices and policies for the wider workforce\n- \u00b7 Sets the performance targets for the annual bonus scheme for senior executives for the year ahead\n- \u00b7 Determines awards under the annual bonus scheme and the group's long-term incentive plans for senior executives\n- \u00b7 Reviews and approves the Report on directors' remuneration\n- \u00b7 Reviews and approves the Policy including seeking shareholder approval, on a binding basis, at least every three years\n- \u00b7 Ensures that all remuneration decisions are made within the parameters of the approved Policy and align with our reward philosophy and our values. No senior executive is involved in any decision about their own remuneration.\n\nAfter each meeting, I report back to the Board on the committee's activities and the main issues discussed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee's key responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference available at bt.com/governance\n\nI am immensely proud of our colleagues who have continued to improve customer service and deliver vital connectivity, as we extended and strengthened our networks to support the country's recovery despite continued disruption to our business and the wider economy.\n\nThis report sets out information on the committee's activities during the year, our remuneration framework and its implementation. I have also provided further context on the performance of the business throughout the year and the environment in which the committee made decisions on executive pay.\n\n## Wider workforce context\n\nSupporting our workforce throughout the pandemic has been a key priority. No colleagues lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic, and we did not make use of the Government's furlough scheme; instead we created new jobs in Openreach and expanded our investment in UK fibre infrastructure at a time in which other companies cut pay, reduced hours and made redundancies.\n\nHowever, we were not immune to the financial impact of the pandemic: although we have continued to support our UK frontline colleagues each year (through a 1.5% increase in 2020 and a \u00a31,000 one-off bonus in 2021), our UK management colleagues have not received an annual salary increase since June 2019.\n\nThis year we committed that all eligible colleagues would receive an annual salary increase. Given the rising cost-of-living pressure faced by many of our colleagues, we have worked hard",

        "page_content": "to maximise the impact of this year's pay increase budget, focused our efforts on our lowest-paid colleagues, and sought to deliver the increase as soon as possible.\n\nAlthough we regretfully were not able to reach agreement with the CWU, this year's pay rise of \u00a31,500 for our UK frontline colleagues and key workers is the biggest investment we've made in more than two decades. We have also voluntarily committed to paying UK colleagues at least the Real Living Wage and recently increased our minimum salary across the board to reflect that.\n\nFor our UK management population a total salary increase budget of 3% was confirmed, but again we targeted this toward our lower-paid managers. A lower budget of 2% was available for the UK senior management team.\n\nHowever, we acknowledge that this remains a sensitive and challenging time, and the committee has borne that in mind throughout the year when considering remuneration matters within its remit.\n\n## Performance and executive remuneration outcomes for FY22\n\n## FY22 annual bonus plan\n\nAnnual bonus performance was based on a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures that align to our strategic priorities.\n\nFinancial performance accounts for 70% of the bonus scorecard and comprises the following measures:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA (35%) - the outcome was in line with our expectations at \u00a37,577m, just below target. Despite pressures on our revenue, we continued to see benefits from our modernisation programme.\n- \u00b7 Normalised free cash flow (35%) - cash flow performance was strong through the second half of the year, and the final outcome of \u00a31,392m was between target and stretch.\n\nOur non-financial measures account for 30% of the bonus scorecard and comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer (10%) - although there was some volatility during the year as the impact of the pandemic dropped off, we saw strong group NPS performance and finished the year just above target. This reflected record NPS results in Consumer, BT SME and Global.\n- \u00b7 Converged networks (10%) - we have continued to drive sales and delivery of the latest network technologies throughout the year. The number of FTTP connections was just above target, while performance against our 5G customers measure was close to stretch.\n\n## \u00b7 Digital impact & sustainability (10%)\n\n- -Skills for tomorrow (5%) - during the year we launched multiple wide-reaching campaigns with targeted support for jobseekers, SMEs and families, reaching 893,000 people across the country. Performance was between target and stretch.\n- -Carbon emissions (5%) - performance against the carbon emissions intensity metric was close to stretch.\n\nWhen determining overall performance and bonus pay-outs, the committee also considers a number of other factors including share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. Despite the formulaic outcome of the\n\nfinal bonus scorecard being 123%, the committee exercised its discretion to cap the bonuses of our executive directors at 100% of target, in line with the chief executive's recommendation. Although we have met our financial goals, held to our commitment to reinstate the dividend in FY22, and delivered a competitive salary review for our colleagues, the committee believes that this is a better reflection of the overall performance of the business and the wider stakeholder experience.\n\nAccordingly, Philip and Simon will be awarded bonuses of \u00a31,320,000 and \u00a3882,526 respectively. In line with the Policy, 50% of the bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## 2019 Incentive Share Plan (ISP) award\n\nThe final award under our legacy ISP was granted in 2019, with performance measured over the three years to 31 March 2022. Vesting is based on three performance measures: relative total shareholder return (40%) (TSR), normalised free cash flow (40%) and growth in underlying revenue (including transit) (20%).\n\nSince the performance targets were set, we have made a number of critical strategic decisions which were not foreseen in our original business plan. Most notably, this includes our commitment to expand the rollout of our full-fibre capability, and the implications for capital expenditure and cash flow. These decisions were being made against an uncertain backdrop given the pandemic, and the level of our commitment and its impact on normalised free cash flow evolved materially. We committed in 2020 to increase our FTTP build to 20m premises by the mid-to-late 2020s and began mobilising to do so. Then in 2021 we increased and accelerated this to 25m premises by December 2026, and made the decision to fully fund the rollout at this level in November 2021. Our increased investment supports the Government's full-fibre ambitions and will be instrumental in delivering further value to our shareholders, but has meant an additional \u00a31.3bn of capital expenditure during the 2019 ISP performance period; something which was not envisaged at the time the targets were set. While this investment will create significant value for the business and our shareholders, the return on investment will not be seen until after the 2019 ISP performance period has ended.\n\nIt is not the committee's intention to penalise management for making strategic decisions that are in the best interests of the business, our shareholders, our customers, and the country as a whole. Following a consultation with our largest shareholders, the committee approved an adjustment to the cash flow measure to reflect the increased investment. In addition, in line with our usual practice, we have made appropriate adjustments to both the cash flow and revenue measures to reflect acquisitions and divestments during the period, to ensure performance is being measured on a like-for-like basis. No adjustments were made to the TSR measure.\n\nIn aggregate, these adjustments ensure that the targets are no more or less stretching than originally intended. These adjustments reflect major Board decisions with significant impact on our targets, but no adjustments have been made for other adverse external impacts including the Government's decision on the use of Huawei equipment.",

Accordingly, 19.1% of the total 2019 ISP award will vest in August 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail is set out on pages 105 to 106 .\n\n## Policy implementation in FY23\n\n## a) Salary\n\nPhilip's salary was fixed for five years on appointment and therefore no increase will be made in FY23. Simon's salary will be increased by 2% on 1 June 2022, in line with the increase offered to our UK senior management team.\n\n## b) Pension\n\nIn line with that previously agreed when the Policy was approved at the 2020 AGM, Simon's pension allowance was reduced to 10% of salary from 1 April 2022 which now fully aligns him with the rate offered to the majority of our UK workforce. Philip's pension allowance remains at 10% of salary.\n\n## c) Annual bonus\n\nWe have reviewed the bonus scorecard measures and weightings and determined that they remain well-aligned with our strategic priorities for the coming year. The committee is satisfied that they represent a meaningful balance of financial performance measures and our broader strategic priorities, including the impact we make for our customers and society. The same group bonus scorecard applies to all eligible managers, used in tandem with divisional scorecards for colleagues in each CFU. Group and divisional measures are aligned to ensure a consistent focus across the business. Openreach managers have a similar bonus scorecard but it is based on Openreach performance only, to maintain independence and to reflect the Commitments.\n\nFor FY23, we have also introduced two underpins, based on health and safety and EBITDA performance. If either of the underpins are triggered, the committee retains the discretion to reduce the pay-out as it considers appropriate.\n\nNo changes are proposed to the structure of the annual bonus plan for FY23: the on-target and maximum opportunity will remain at 120% and 200% of salary for both Philip and Simon, with 50% deferred into shares for a period of three years.\n\n## d) Long-term incentives\n\nIn line with the Policy, awards will be made to both Philip and Simon in June 2022 under our Restricted Share Plan (RSP) to the value of 200% of salary. These will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, and no tranche may be sold until year five. As per last year, awards are subject to both return on capital employed (ROCE) and environmental, social and governance (ESG) underpins (see page 109 ), and the committee retains ultimate discretion to adjust the vesting outcome as it considers appropriate, including to nil.\n\n## e) Chairman and non-executive director fees\n\nAs part of the annual compensation cycle the Board has reviewed the fees payable to our non-executive directors. Given these fees have also remained unchanged since 1 June 2019, on the recommendation of the chairman and the executive directors, the Board has agreed that the base fee will be increased by 2%, effective 1 June 2022, in line with the increase offered to the UK senior management team.\n\nIn FY22, the committee agreed a fee of \u00a3700,000 per annum for Adam Crozier who joined as a non-executive director and chairman designate on 1 November 2021, and became chairman on 1 December 2021. No review of the chairman's fee took place as he voluntarily waived any increase this year.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations. The committee takes account of these factors when making decisions relating to executive remuneration.\n\nDuring the year, Isabel Hudson, as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement, also fed back any comments to the committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions at their meetings.\n\nWe published this year's gender pay gap statistics at the end of March in our gender pay gap statement. For the second year running, we have also elected to voluntarily publish similar analysis of our ethnicity pay gap. Both analyses, alongside more detail on how we are addressing inequality and championing diversity across our business, can be found in our Diversity and Inclusion Report. The recently launched BT Group Manifesto, also reaffirms our bold targets for gender, ethnicity and disability across the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 32 to 33 .\n\nAs always, the committee and I wish to maintain an open dialogue on remuneration matters with our investors and I would welcome their comments or feedback and support at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Sir Ian Cheshire\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 11 May 2022",

However, maximum total compensation levels are set lower than typical market practice to reflect the narrower and more predictable range of performance outcomes for BT Group\n- \u00b7 Formulaic incentive outcomes are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and may be adjusted having consideration to overall group performance and wider workforce remuneration policies and practices.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u00b7 When considering performance, the Remuneration Committee takes account of BT Group's values\n- \u00b7 The Remuneration Committee receives regular updates on remuneration practices and policies for the wider workforce, and colleagues may provide feedback to the Board via the Colleague Board and the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement\n- \u00b7 All-employee share plans encourage our colleagues to become shareholders in the business.\n\nopinion of the Remuneration Committee , the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of BT Group plc (or taking on such other applicable position). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the directors as described in the Policy, for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation.",

We also provide death in service cover consisting of a lump sum equal to four times his salary plus a dependants' pension equal to 30% of his capped salary.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nBoth executive directors were eligible for an on-target bonus in respect of FY22 of 120% of salary with a maximum opportunity of 200% of salary. The annual bonus is based on performance against a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures linked to our KPIs as set out on pages 44 to 45 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Category                                      | Measure                                       | Weighting                                     | Threshold                                     | Target                                        | Stretch                                       | Actual                                        |                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Financial                                     | Adjusted EBITDA (\u00a3m)                          | 35%                                           | 7,385                                         | 7,585                                         | 7,785                                         | 7,577                                         | 59%                                           |\n|                                               | Normalised free cash flow (\u00a3m)                | 35%                                           | 1,142                                         | 1,292                                         | 1,442                                         | 1,392                                         | 87%                                           |\n| Customer                                      | NPS                                           | 10%                                           | 0                                             | 100                                           | 200                                           | 122                                           | 69%                                           |\n| Converged  networks                           | 5G customers (000s)                           | 5%                                            | 4,418                                         | 4,909                                         | 5,384                                         | 5,299                                         | 93%                                           |\n|                                               | FTTP connections (000s)                       | 5%                                            | 1,574                                         | 1,749                                         | 1,924                                         | 1,772                                         | 65%                                           |\n| Digital impact  & sustainability              | Carbon emissions (%)                          | 5%                                            | (51)                                          | (53)                                          | (55)                                          | (54.7)                                        | 94%                                           |\n|                                               | Skills for Tomorrow (000s)                    | 5%                                            | 600                                           | 800                                           | 1,200                                         | 893                                           | 69%                                           |\n| Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) | Formulaic outcome 74% of max (123% of target) |\n\nWhen determining the overall performance and bonus payouts, the committee also considers a number of other factors including share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. Despite the formulaic outcome of the final bonus scorecard being 123%, the committee exercised its discretion to cap the bonuses of our executive directors at 100%, in line with the chief executive's recommendation. Although we have delivered against our financial goals, held to our commitment to reinstate the dividend in FY22, and delivered a competitive salary review for our colleagues, the committee believes that this is a better reflection of the overall performance of the business and the wider stakeholder experience.\n\nThe final bonus outturns for the executive directors are set out in the table below:\n\n|               | Formulaic  outcome   | Following  discretion   | % of  max   | Value          |\n|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 123% of   target     | 100% of   target        |             | 60% \u00a31,320,000 |\n| Simon Lowth   | 123% of   target     | 100% of   target        | 60%         | \u00a3882,526       |\n\nAs per the Policy, 50% of the FY22 annual bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## 2019 ISP\n\nThe ISP is a conditional share award. The committee assesses the performance conditions to 31 March 2022 and the awards would ordinarily vest in June 2022. The performance conditions are based 40% on relative TSR, 40% on normalised free cash flow, and 20% on growth in underlying revenue (including transit) over a three-year performance period from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2022.\n\nSince the performance targets were set, we have made a number of critical strategic decisions which were not foreseen in our original business plan. Most notably, this includes our commitment to expand the rollout of our full-fibre capability to 20m premises (in 2020) and then further to 25m premises by December 2026 (in 2021) with the decision to fully fund this being made in November 2021. Our increased investment supports the Government's full fibre ambitions and will be instrumental in delivering further value to our shareholders, but has meant an additional \u00a31.3bn of capital expenditure during the 2019 ISP performance period; something which was not envisaged at the time the targets were set. While this investment will create significant value for the business and our shareholders, the return on investment will not be seen until after the 2019 ISP performance period has ended.\n\nFollowing a consultation with our largest shareholders, the committee approved an adjustment to the cash flow measure to reflect the increased investment. In addition, in line with our usual practice, we have made appropriate adjustments to both the cash flow and revenue measures to reflect acquisitions and divestments during the period to ensure performance is being measured on a like-for-like basis. No adjustments were made to the TSR measure. In aggregate, this ensures that the targets are no more or less stretching than originally intended.\n\nAs set out in the table overleaf, performance against the adjusted cash flow targets was mid-way between target and stretch, while performance against both the TSR and adjusted revenue measures was below threshold. Accordingly, 19.1% of the total award will vest in August 2022.",

An award of 200% of salary was made to both executive directors in line with the normal Policy level. The face value was based on the BT Group plc share price at the date of grant of 203.16p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT Group plc share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of award   | RSP award  (shares)   | Face value   of award   |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 24 June 2021    | 1,082,854             | \u00a32,200,000              |\n| Simon Lowth   | 24 June 2021    | 723,974               | \u00a31,470,825              |\n\nThese awards are conditional share awards.

At vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions apply as set out in the Policy, and the committee retains the ultimate discretion to adjust vesting levels to ensure alignment with our overall performance.\n\nDetails of all interests under the RSP are set out on page 108 .\n\n## 2021 deferred shares\n\nThe full bonus awarded for FY21 was deferred into shares as voluntarily agreed by the executive directors. The awards were made under the deferred bonus plan (DBP) in June 2021 as set out below and on page 108 . The face value was based on the BT Group plc share price at the date of grant of 203.16p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT Group plc share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of award   | Number of  deferred  shares   | Face value   of award   |\n|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 24 June 2021    | 649,712                       | \u00a31,320,000              |\n| Simon Lowth   | 24 June 2021    | 434,384                       | \u00a3882,526                |\n\nDeferred shares are not subject to performance conditions and have a three-year vesting period. Details of all interests in deferred shares are set out on page 108 .\n\nAt vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to directors during the year for loss of office.\n\n## Former directors (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to former directors during the year.\n\n## Directors' share ownership (audited)\n\nThe committee believes that the interests of the executive directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The aim is to encourage the build-up of a meaningful shareholding in BT Group plc over time by retaining net shares received through the executive share plans or from market purchases.\n\nThe shareholding requirement for both executive directors under the Policy is 500% of salary. Executive directors are expected to meet this requirement within five years of the approval of the Policy or, in the case of any new executive directors appointed, within five years of their date of appointment.\n\nThe shareholding requirement continues to apply in full for two years post-cessation of employment (or the total number of shares held at cessation, if lower). The post-cessation shareholding requirement will be calculated and expressed as a fixed number of shares by reference to the closing BT Group plc share price on the day immediately prior to the cessation date. The requirement is fixed as this number of shares for a period of two years and compliance will be measured at cessation and annually thereafter. In enforcing continued compliance post-cessation, the committee may request that the executive director transfers any shares subject to the shareholding requirement which we will hold in trust until such time that they no longer need to be retained.\n\nWe encourage the chairman and independent non-executive directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis, BT Group plc shares with an aggregate value of \u00a35,000 on average each year (based on acquisition price) to further align the interests of non-executive directors with those of our shareholders. They are asked to hold these shares until they cease being a member of the Board.\n\nThis policy does not apply to the Deutsche Telekom nominated representative director appointed to the Board as a nonindependent, non-executive director under the terms of the EE acquisition in January 2016. This helps avoid any conflict of interest.",

In 2021, the level of awards granted was in line with the normal Policy level of 200% of salary. Following review, the committee has agreed that awards will be granted to both executive directors this year at the normal Policy level of 200% of salary.\n\nTwo underpins will apply over the initial three-year vesting period, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 ROCE is equal to or exceeds WACC over the same period\n- \u00b7 there must have been no ESG issues which have resulted in material reputational damage for the group.\n\nShould one or both underpins not be met, the committee may at its discretion reduce the number of shares vesting, including to nil.\n\nAwards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, with an additional holding period such that no shares may be sold until year five. At vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions and overarching committee discretion applies, as set out in the Policy.\n\n## Chairman and non-executive director remuneration\n\nThe fees for non-executive directors have been reviewed by the Board, taking into consideration the role and requirements of the group, together with the fees paid to non-executive directors at companies of a similar size and complexity and any salary increases for the UK management population. In line with the increase for the UK senior management population, on the recommendation of the chairman and the executive directors, the Board agreed to increase the base fee for non-executive directors by 2% to \u00a378,540 per year (from \u00a377,000) effective as of 1 June 2022. No other fee changes were agreed as part of the review.\n\nThere are additional fees for membership and chairing a board committee, details of which are set out in the table below:\n\n| Committee                       | Chair's   fee   | Member's  fee   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Audit & Risk                    | \u00a335,000         | \u00a325,000         |\n| BT Compliance                   | \u00a325,000         | \u00a312,000         |\n| Digital Impact & Sustainability | \u00a314,000         | \u00a38,000          |\n| Investigatory Powers Governance | n/a a           | \u00a38,000          |\n| Nominations                     | n/a a           | \u00a310,000         |\n| Remuneration                    | \u00a330,000         | \u00a315,000         |\n\n- a  Where the chairman or chief executive acts as chair of a board committee, no additional committee chair fee is payable.\n\nThe senior independent director receives an additional fee of \u00a327,000 per annum.\n\nThe designated non-executive director for workforce engagement receives an additional fee of \u00a310,000 per annum.\n\nThe committee agreed a fee of \u00a3700,000 per year, on the chairman's appointment as chairman designate on 1 November 2021. The chairman has voluntarily decided to waive any fee increase for FY23.\n\nNo element of non-executive director remuneration is performance related.

That advice materially assisted the committee in their consideration of matters relating to executive remuneration and the Policy.\n\nDeloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nIn addition, during FY22, Deloitte provided the group with advice on corporate and indirect taxes, assistance with regulatory, risk and compliance issues and additional consultancy services.\n\n## Dilution\n\nWe use both treasury shares and shares purchased by the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to satisfy our all-employee share plans and executive share plans. Shares held in the Trust do not have any voting rights.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, shares equivalent to 4.16% (FY21: 5.12%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be required to satisfy all outstanding share options and awards.

The graph below illustrates the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR relative to a broad equity market index over the past ten years. We consider the FTSE 100 to be the most appropriate index against which to measure performance, as BT Group plc has been a member of the FTSE 100 throughout the ten-year period.\n\nSource: Datastream.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## History of chief executive remuneration\n\n| Year end   | Chief executive   | Total  remuneration  \u00a3000   | Annual  bonus  (% of  max)   | ISP  vesting  (% of  max)   |\n|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2022       | Philip Jansen     | 3,460                       | 60%                          | 19.1%                       |\n| 2021       | Philip Jansen     | 2,628                       | 60%                          | 0%                          |\n| 2020       | Philip Jansen     | 3,248                       | 50%                          | n/a                         |\n| 2019       | Philip Jansen a   | 725                         | 56%                          | n/a                         |\n|            | Gavin Patterson b | 1,719                       | 28%                          | 0%                          |\n| 2018       | Gavin Patterson   | 2,307                       | 54%                          | 0%                          |\n| 2017       | Gavin Patterson   | 1,345                       | 0%                           | 0%                          |\n| 2016       | Gavin Patterson   | 5,396                       | 45%                          | 82.0%                       |\n| 2015       | Gavin Patterson b | 4,562                       | 58%                          | 67.4%                       |\n| 2014       | Gavin Patterson c | 2,901                       | 62%                          | 78.7%                       |\n|            | Ian Livingston d  | 4,236                       | 35%                          | 63.4%                       |\n| 2013       | Ian Livingston    | 9,402                       | 65%                          | 100%                        |\n\n- c  The total remuneration figure includes the ISP award as CEO BT Retail and the first award as chief executive, granted in 2013.\n\nd  Ian stepped down on 10 September 2013 and Gavin took over from that date.",

Deutsche Telekom.

There are no family relationships between the directors.\n\n## Independent non-executive directors' letters of appointment\n\nEach independent non-executive director has an appointment letter setting out the terms of his or her appointment. We ask each non-executive director to allow a minimum commitment of 22 days each year, subject to committee responsibilities, and to allow slightly more in the first year in order to take part in the induction programme. The actual time commitment required in any year may vary depending on business and additional time may be required during periods of increased activity.\n\n## Inspection by the public\n\nThe service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by the public at BT Group plc's registered office.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration in context\n\n## Consideration of colleague and stakeholder views\n\nOur colleagues are vital to our business and we believe in fairness throughout the group. There are several general reward principles which we apply at all levels:\n\n- \u00b7 We will provide a competitive package with reference to the relevant market for each colleague\n- \u00b7 We will ensure colleagues can share in the success of the business, and through the operation of all-employee share plans encourage colleagues to become shareholders\n- \u00b7 Where appropriate, variable remuneration is provided to incentivise employees towards driving the strategic aims of the business. Performance is based on both individual performance and the performance of the group, using a consistent framework for our senior management team and the majority of other colleagues\n- \u00b7 We offer a range of employee benefits, many of which are available to all colleagues\n- \u00b7 We aim for transparency and a fair cascade of remuneration throughout the group\n- \u00b7 Employment conditions for all colleagues reflect our values and are commensurate with those of a large publicly listed company, including high standards of health and safety, a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion and wellbeing.\n\nThe committee supports fairness and transparency of remuneration arrangements and the Policy has been designed to align with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across the wider group. To support this, the committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations.\n\nWhilst the committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining executive pay, the Board does receive feedback from employee surveys that take into account remuneration throughout the organisation.\n\nThe designated non-executive director for workforce engagement also updates the committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions.\n\nWhen setting executive directors' remuneration, the committee considers the remuneration of other senior managers and colleagues in the group more generally to ensure that arrangements for executive directors are appropriate in this context. When determining salary increases for executive directors, the committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the group.\n\n## Chief executive pay ratio\n\nThe table below sets out the chief executive pay ratios as at 31 March 2022, as well as those reported in respect of the prior three years. This report will build up over time to show a rolling ten-year period.\n\nThe ratios compare the single total figure of remuneration of the chief executive with the equivalent figures for the UK lower quartile (P25), median (P50) and upper quartile (P75) employees.\n\nA significant proportion of the chief executive's remuneration is delivered through long-term incentives, where awards are linked to share price movements over the longer term. This means that the ratios will depend significantly on long-term incentive outcomes and may fluctuate from year to year - for example, a higher total remuneration ratio was exhibited in 2020 due to the vesting of the chief executive's Worldpay buyout award and in 2022 due to the partial vesting of the 2019 ISP award. We believe that these ratios are appropriate given the size and complexity of the business, and are a fair reflection of our remuneration principles and practices.\n\nWe have used the 'Option B' methodology (based on gender pay reporting), as the most robust way to identify the individual reference points within an organisation with multiple operating segments.\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a32,444,000      | \u00a334,281                 | \u00a341,477                 | \u00a351,594                 | 71:1        | 59:1        | 47:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a33,248,012      | \u00a334,881                 | \u00a342,173                 | \u00a351,351                 | 93:1        | 77:1        | 63:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a32,628,107      | \u00a335,569                 | \u00a341,600                 | \u00a350,391                 | 74:1        | 63:1        | 52:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a33,459,514      | \u00a335,722                 | \u00a340,059                 | \u00a349,488                 | 97:1        | 86:1        | 70:1        |\n\n## Base salary\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a31,222,000      | \u00a330,090                 | \u00a335,918                 | \u00a341,740                 | 37:1        | 31:1        | 27:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,144                 | \u00a337,321                 | \u00a342,800                 | 35:1        | 29:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,842                 | \u00a335,606                 | \u00a342,836                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,637                 | \u00a335,017                 | \u00a343,908                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 25:1        |\n\nThe P25, P50 and P75 employees were identified from our gender pay reporting data, based on the April snapshot period at the start of each respective year. We then identified the 80 employees above and below each of the 'P' points to form enlarged groups. This approach is thought to be an appropriate representation - while there is a reasonable level of consistency\n\ngiven the size of the UK population, this methodology reduces volatility in the underlying data, and helps account for differences in the gender pay and pay ratio calculation methodologies. Other than the exclusion of a small number of data points for leavers and divestments, no other adjustments were made to the underlying data.",

Bonus payments in respect of each year have been determined based on the latest available information at the time of analysis. The median total remuneration figure for each group was then used to determine the three ratios.\n\n## Percentage change in remuneration of the executive and non-executive directors and all employees\n\nBT Group plc, our parent company, employs our chairman, executive and non-executive directors only, and as such no meaningful comparison can be drawn based on the parent company alone, as is required by the reporting regulations.\n\nInstead, we have chosen to present a comparison with our UK management and technical employee population, comprising around 25,000 colleagues.\n\nWe believe this is the most meaningful comparison given the nature of our workforce, as this group has similar performancerelated pay arrangements as our executive directors. This is also consistent with prior year disclosures.\n\nThe salary/fee levels set out in the table below are in accordance with the Policy. Any increase in fees paid to the non-executive directors represents a change in role (and accordingly fees payable) over the relevant period. Any increase in benefits is as a result of travel and other expenses further to returning to face-to-face Board and committee meetings for the majority of FY22 whereas in FY21 these were all held remotely by video conference due to the pandemic.\n\n|                          | FY22 (% change)   | FY22 (% change)   | FY22 (% change)   | FY21 (% change)   | FY21 (% change)   | FY21 (% change)   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                          | Salary/  fees     | Benefits          | Annual  bonus     | Salary/  fees     | Benefits          | Annual  bonus     |\n| Chairman                 |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Adam Crozier a           | -                 | -                 | -                 |                   |                   |                   |\n| Executive directors      |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Philip Jansen            | 0%                | 2%                | 0%                | 0%                | (14)%             | 0%                |\n| Simon Lowth b            | 0%                | (4)%              | 0%                | 0%                | (5)%              | (2)%              |\n| Non-executive directors  |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Adel Al-Saleh c          | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| Ian Cheshire             | 8%                | 0%                | -                 | 19%               | -                 | -                 |\n| Iain Conn                | 0%                | 0%                | -                 | 33%               | -                 | -                 |\n| Isabel Hudson            | 0%                | 0%                | -                 | 4%                | (66)%             | -                 |\n| Matthew Key              | 2%                | 0%                | -                 | 13%               | -                 | -                 |\n| Allison Kirkby           | 0%                | 0%                | -                 | 6%                | -                 | -                 |\n| Leena Nair               | 0%                | 0%                | -                 | 3%                | -                 | -                 |\n| Sara Weller d            | 0%                | 0%                | -                 | -                 | -                 | -                 |\n| UK management colleagues | 0%                | 0%                | 0%                | 0%                | 0%                | 18%               |\n\n- a  Adam joined during FY22 and so no relevant comparison can be presented.\n- b  Simon's reduction in benefits reflects the year on year reduction in pension allowance.\n- c  Under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom and Adel's letter of appointment, no remuneration is payable for this position.\n- d  Sara joined during the prior financial year and so any increase has been determined on a full-year equivalent basis.\n\n## Relative importance of the spend on pay\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change in total remuneration paid to all employees compared to expenditure on dividends and share buybacks.\n\n| Area                                | FY22   (\u00a3m)   | FY21   (\u00a3m)   | %   change   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Remuneration paid to all  employees | 4,845         | 5,162         | (6)%         |\n| Dividends/share buybacks a          | 184           | 14            | 1,214%       |\n\n- a  Includes share purchases by the Trust as set out in note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nIt's important that our colleagues reflect the diversity of our customers, and that all our colleagues are given the opportunities to succeed.

        "page_content": "## Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements\n\n## The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company, and of the group's profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent\n- \u00b7 state whether the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards, as adopted by the UK\n- \u00b7 state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed with regards to the parent company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- \u00b7 assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the parent company, and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 2006 Act. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing an annual strategic report, directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and corporate governance statement that comply with such law and regulation.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the BT Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Board in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements , prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- \u00b7 the Strategic report and the Report of the directors include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThis responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 11 May 2022 and was signed on its behalf by:\n\nPhilip Jansen Chief Executive\n\nSimon Lowth Chief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors\n\nThe directors present the Report of the directors , together with\n\naudited financial information for the year ended 31 March 2022. The Report of the directors also encompasses the entirety of our Corporate governance report on pages 71 to 120 for the purpose of section 463 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). The Report of the directors together with the Strategic report on pages 1 to 70 form the Management Report for the basis of DTR 4.1.5R.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and are set out on pages 135 and 136 of the consolidated financial statements . The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed that they are appropriate for the preparation of the FY22 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nAs far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 2006 Act) that hasn't been disclosed to the auditor. Each of the directors confirms that all steps have been taken that ought to have been taken to make them aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor has been made aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and revised FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Strategic report on pages 1 to 70 includes information on the group structure, strategy and business model, the performance of each customer-facing unit and the impact of regulation and competition. The Group performance section on pages 46 to 53 includes information on our group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and net debt, and balance sheet position. Notes 24, 25, 26 and 28 of the consolidated financial statements include information on the group's investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, financial risk management objectives, hedging policies and exposure to interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and market risks.\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 58 to 65 including details of each risk and how we manage and mitigate them. The directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks affecting the group, including any that could threaten our business model, future performance, insolvency or liquidity.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on page 70 , in estimating the financial impact for a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually and in combination through stochastic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2023, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks (including severe but plausible downsides, refer to the Viability statement on page 70 ).\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a30.8bn and current asset investments of \u00a32.7bn. The group also had access to committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn. These facilities were undrawn at the period-end and are not subject to renewal until March 2027.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nThe Board has a procedure that allows directors to seek independent professional advice at our expense. All directors also have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and her nominated delegate.\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnity\n\nFor some years, we have bought insurance cover for directors, officers and employees in positions of managerial supervision of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries. This is intended to protect against defence costs, civil damages and, in some circumstances, civil fines and penalties following an action brought against them in their personal capacity. The policy also covers individuals serving as directors of other companies or of joint ventures, or on boards of trade associations or charitable organisations at the group's request. The insurance protects the directors and officers directly in circumstances where, by law, BT Group plc cannot provide an indemnity. It also provides the group, subject to a retention, with cover against the cost of indemnifying a director or officer. One layer of insurance is ringfenced for the directors of BT Group plc.\n\nAs at 11 May 2022, and throughout FY22, BT Group plc's wholly-owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity for a group of people similar to the group covered by the above insurance. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where the individual is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.\n\nAs permitted by BT Group plc's Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by law, the group indemnifies each of its directors and other officers against certain liabilities that may be incurred as a result of their positions within the group. The indemnity was in force throughout the tenure of each director during the last financial year, and remains in force.\n\n## Interest of management in certain transactions\n\nDuring and at the end of FY22, none of BT Group plc's directors were materially interested in any material transaction in relation to the group's business. None are materially interested in any currently proposed material transactions.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors continued\n\n## Power to authorise conflicts\n\nAll directors have a duty under the 2006 Act to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the group. BT Group plc's Articles of Association include provisions for dealing with directors' conflicts of interest in accordance with the 2006 Act. The group has procedures in place, which it follows, to deal with such situations. These require the Board to:\n\n- \u00b7 consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts\n- \u00b7 consider the conflict situation in conjunction with its other duties under the 2006 Act\n- \u00b7 keep records and Board minutes on any authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given\n- \u00b7 regularly review conflict authorisation.\n\nThe company secretary maintains a conflicts of interest register.\n\nThe Conflicted Matters Committee identifies to what extent Board and committee materials are likely to refer to a potential or actual conflict of interest between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom and, as a result, what materials should be shared with our non-independent, non-executive director and Deutsche Telekom nominated representative. He owes duties to both BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom, and the Conflicted Matters Committee helps him comply with his fiduciary duties, although ultimate responsibility rests with him.\n\n## Systems of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing the group's systems of risk management and internal control each year, and for ensuring their effectiveness, including in respect of relevant assurance activities. These systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risks we face that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives and delivering our strategy. Any system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nOur group risk management framework is simple and consistent, and defines our (1) risk mindset and culture, (2) risk process and activities; and finally (3) governance. The framework:\n\n- \u00b7 provides the business with the tools to take on the right risks and make smart risk decisions\n- \u00b7 supports the identification, assessment and management of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group\n- \u00b7 is an integral part of BT Group's annual strategic review cycle.\n\nThe framework was designed in accordance with the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting and has been in operation throughout the year and up to the date on which this document was approved. The framework was reviewed in FY22 and deemed effective, with continuous enhancements around supporting smarter decision-making, expansion of emerging risk hubs and further embedding of the framework.\n\nMore information on our group risk management framework can be found under the section Risk Management - Building Trust across BT Group on pages 55 to 57 .\n\nInternal audit carry out periodic assessments of the quality of risk management and control, promote effective risk management across all our units and report to management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the status of specific areas identified for improvement. We do not cover joint ventures and associates not controlled by the group in the scope of our group risk management framework. Such third parties are responsible for their own internal control assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit & Risk Committee , on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control across the group. Further details on how the Audit & Risk Committee fulfils these duties can be found on pages 89 to 95 .\n\n## Capital management and funding policy\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating objectives, while investing in the business, supporting our pension schemes and meeting our distribution policy.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews the group's capital structure. Management proposes actions which reflect the group's investment plans and risk characteristics, as well as the macroeconomic conditions in which we operate.\n\nOur funding policy is to raise and invest funds centrally to meet the group's anticipated requirements. We use a combination of capital market bond issuance and committed borrowing facilities to fund the group. When issuing debt, in order to avoid refinancing risk, group treasury will take into consideration the maturity profile of the group's debt portfolio as well as forecast cash flows.\n\nSee note 28 to the consolidated financial statements for details of our treasury policy.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the group's financial risk management objectives, policies of the group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange are given in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Credit risk management policy\n\nWe take proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on our financial instruments. In managing investments and derivative financial instruments, the group's central treasury function monitors the credit quality across treasury counterparties and actively manages any exposures that arise. Management within the business units also actively monitors any exposures arising from trading balances.",

In respect of each of the claims described in note 19, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group.

If there is an offer for the shares or another transaction that would lead to a change of control, such participants may direct the trustee to accept the offer or agree to the transaction\n- \u00b7 in respect of shares held in the Trust, the trustee abstains from voting those shares if there is an offer for the shares. The trustee does not have to accept or reject the offer but will have regard to the interests of the participants, may consult the participants to obtain their views on the offer, and may otherwise take any action with respect to the offer that it thinks is fair\n- \u00b7 EasyShare is the group's corporate sponsored nominee service, which allows UK and European Economic Area resident shareholders to hold BT Group plc shares electronically. EasyShare is administered by Equiniti Financial Services Limited.

The directors may exercise all the powers of BT Group plc, subject to the Articles of Association, legislation and regulation. This includes the ability to exercise the authority to allot or purchase BT Group plc shares pursuant to shareholders passing an ordinary resolution at the annual general meeting (AGM)\n- \u00b7 we have no agreements with directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment as a result of a takeover. Similarly, there is no provision for this in our standard employee contracts\n- \u00b7 we are not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or on voting rights.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nBT Group plc's current Articles of Association were adopted pursuant to a resolution passed at the AGM of BT Group plc held on 15 July 2021 and contain, amongst others, provisions on the rights and obligations attaching to BT Group plc's shares. The Articles of Association may only be amended by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the current Articles of Association is available at bt.com/articles\n\n## Directors' appointment, retirement and removal\n\nThe Articles of Association regulate the appointment and removal of directors, as does the 2006 Act and related legislation. The Board, and shareholders (by ordinary resolution), may appoint a person who is willing to be elected as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. At every AGM, all directors must automatically retire. A retiring director is eligible for election or re-election, as applicable. In addition to any power of removal under the 2006 Act, the shareholders can pass an ordinary resolution to remove a director.\n\nAdel Al-Saleh is appointed as a non-independent, non-executive director under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom. The appointment is terminable immediately by either party.\n\n## Share rights\n\n## (a) Voting rights\n\nOn a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.\n\nThere are no restrictions on exercising voting rights except in situations where BT Group plc is legally entitled to impose such a restriction (for example where a notice under section 793 of the 2006 Act has been served).\n\n## (b) Variation of rights\n\nWhenever the share capital of BT Group plc is split into different classes of shares, the special rights attached to any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either: (i) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or (ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class. BT Group plc can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally. BT Group plc currently has one class of shares.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nThere is no specific restriction on the transfer of BT Group plc shares in the group, which is governed by the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nEngaging with our colleagues takes many forms, including through:\n\n- \u00b7 our annual Your Say employee engagement survey and pulse survey\n- \u00b7 union/employee representative engagement\n- \u00b7 the Colleague Board , our workforce engagement mechanism\n- \u00b7 regular colleague communications.\n\nColleagues are kept well informed on matters such as the strategy and performance of the group, including after certain key events such as results and trading updates. Please see further details of the Colleague Board's activities on pages 80 to 81 and the other means by which we engage with our colleagues on page 36 .\n\nShare plans are used to encourage colleagues to have a stake in the future of the group. We annually consider which allemployee plans to offer, both within the UK and globally. In June 2021, we again operated the yourshare plan granting \u00a3500 worth of BT Group plc shares (or a cash equivalent where there were geographical restrictions) to all eligible colleagues. This utilised the free share element of the share incentive plan in the UK and conditional share awards internationally. Colleagues also have the opportunity to join our all-employee share plans; save as you earn (saveshare) and the share incentive plan (directshare), to the extent these are operated each year.",

In 2021, we launched our Disability Rapid Action Plan (DRAP). This plan is our Valuable 500 commitment to accelerate the pace of progress we are making to support disabled and neurodiverse colleagues, and those that have an impairment, or a long-term health condition.\n\nWe renewed our status as a Disability Confident Leader and worked with several teams across the business, our Able2 People Network and external partner the Business Disability Forum, to focus on four key DRAP areas; attraction and recruitment, diversifying our talent by broadening our Accelerate fast stream talent programme, end-to-end reviews of our workplace adjustment processes, and training and awareness initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on diversity and inclusion, including our Diversity and Inclusion Report, at bt.com/diversity-and-inclusion\n\n## Political donations\n\nOur policy is that no company in the group will make contributions in cash or in kind to any political party, whether by gift or loan. However, the definition of political donations used in the 2006 Act is significantly broader than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. The 2006 Act's remit could cover making members of Parliament and others in the political world aware of key industry issues and matters affecting BT Group plc, and enhancing their understanding of the group.\n\nThe authority for political donations requested at the 2022 AGM is not intended to change this policy. It will, however, ensure that the group continues to act within the provisions of the 2006 Act, requiring companies to obtain shareholder authority before they make donations to political parties and/or political organisations as defined in the 2006 Act. During FY22, BT Group plc's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, paid the costs of attending events at (i) the Labour party conference; (ii) the Conservative party conference; and (iii) the Welsh Labour party conference. These costs totalled \u00a36,205 (FY21: \u00a3922) which were greater than last year, as events were attended in person rather than virtually. No company in the BT Group made any loans to any political party.\n\n## Substantial shareholdings\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, BT Group plc had received notice, under the DTRs, in respect of the following holdings of 3% or more of the voting rights in its issued ordinary share capital:\n\n|                                 | Date of notification           | Shares      | %   of total  voting  rights   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|\n| Altice UK S.\u00e0 r.l.              | 13 December 2021 1,785,476,188 |             | 18.0%                          |\n| T-Mobile Holdings 23 March 2018 |                                |             | 1,196,175,322 12.06%           |\n| BlackRock, Inc.                 | 1 February 2022                | 611,646,054 | 6.15%                          |\n\nIn the period 31 March to 11 May 2022, BT Group plc received three further notifications from BlackRock, Inc., the most recent of which was on 20 April 2022 disclosing a holding of 670,942,065 BT Group plc shares equating to 6.74% of the total voting rights.\n\n## AGM\n\n## Resolutions\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on all resolutions including the Annual Report, the Report on directors' remuneration , the election/re-election of directors, the reappointment of KPMG LLP as our external auditor and to authorise the Audit & Risk Committee to agree its remuneration, giving authority to the directors to allot BT Group plc shares and disapply pre-emption rights.\n\nBefore the AGM, we count the proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as votes withheld, and make the results available as soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of the meeting. As at previous AGMs, we will take votes on all matters at the 2022 AGM on a poll.\n\nThe separate Notice of meeting 2022, which we send to all shareholders who have requested shareholder documents by post, contains the resolutions (with explanatory notes) which we will propose at the 2022 AGM on 14 July 2022. We notify all shareholders of the publication of these documents which are available on our website at bt.com/annualreport\n\n## Authority to purchase shares\n\nThe authority given at the 2021 AGM for BT Group plc to purchase in the market 991m of its shares, representing 10% of BT Group plc's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares), expires at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. We will ask shareholders to give a similar authority at the 2022 AGM.\n\nDuring FY22 and up to 11 May 2022, no shares were purchased under this authority.\n\nAt the start of the year, 50.7m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a32.5m, and constituting 0.5% of the issued share capital (0.5% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares. During FY22, 9.3m treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a3465,000, and constituting 0.09% of the issued share capital (0.09% excluding treasury shares)) were transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans. At 31 March 2022, a total of 41.4m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a32.1m, and constituting 0.41% of the issued share capital (0.41% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares.\n\nSince 31 March 2022 (up to and including 11 May 2022), 784,038 treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a339,200, and constituting 0.007% of the issued share capital (0.007% excluding treasury shares)) have been transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans.\n\nAt 11 May 2022, a total of 40.6m shares (having a nominal value of \u00a32m, and constituting 0.4% of the issued share capital (0.4% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares.\n\nIn addition, the Trust purchased 98.8m BT Group plc shares for a total consideration of \u00a3182m. The Trust held 79.1m shares both at 31 March 2022 and 11 May 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to the members of BT Group plc\n\n## 1. Our opinion is unmodified\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of BT Group plc ('the Company') for the year ended 31 March 2022 which comprise the Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, Group balance sheet, Group statement of changes in equity, Group cash flow statement, company balance sheet, company statement of changes in equity, and the related notes, including the accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2022 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK- adopted international accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and\n- \u00b7 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 11 July 2018. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the four financial years ended 31 March 2022. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.\n\n## 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2021), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of certain unquoted investments in the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS)\n\nCertain unquoted investments in the BTPS: included within unquoted BTPS plan assets of \u00a318.6 billion (2021: \u00a317.9 billion)\n\n## Risk vs 2021: decrease\n\nRefer to page 89 Audit & Risk Committee Report), page 168 (note 20 accounting policy Retirement benefit plans) and pages 167 to 179 (disclosures note 20 Retirement benefit plans).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\nThe BTPS has unquoted plan assets in private equity, UK and overseas property, mature infrastructure, longevity insurance contracts, secure income and non-core credit assets. Significant judgement is required to determine the value of a portion of these unquoted investments, which are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable. Furthermore, the geo-political events in 2022, which directly affect market conditions, have resulted in some risk of volatility in asset valuation. Notwithstanding this, the overall risk has decreased in the current year compared to the prior period.\n\nThe key unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of these plan assets includes estimated rental value for the UK and overseas property, discount rates and comparable transactions for mature infrastructure and certain secure income assets, discount rate and projected future mortality for the longevity insurance contract and estimated net asset values for private equity, non-core credit assets and certain secure income assets.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of unquoted plan assets in the BTPS has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\nThe financial statements (note 20) disclose as part of sensitivities of growth assets the key sensitivities of key assumptions for the valuation of unquoted plan assets.\n\n## Our response - our procedures included:\n\nAssessing valuers' credentials: Evaluating the scope, competencies and objectivity of the Group's external experts who assisted in determining the key unobservable inputs and market indices listed above.\n\nAssessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the asset valuations to these assumptions.\n\n## Longevity insurance contract\n\nComparing valuations: Challenging, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, the fair value of the longevity insurance contract by comparing it to an independently developed range of fair values using assumptions, such as the discount rate and projected future mortality, based on external data.\n\n## Property/infrastructure and certain secure income assets\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the support of our own valuation specialists, the key unobservable inputs, such as estimated rental value and market value, used in determining the fair value of a sample of UK and overseas property assets, and discount rates used in determining the mature infrastructure and certain secure income assets by comparing them to discount rates for comparable external assets.",

A change in the methodology applied or small changes in the key actuarial assumptions over the life expectancy of members, price inflation, and discount rates can significantly impact the valuation of the BTPS defined benefit obligation in the financial statements.\n\nThe impacts of the Covid pandemic and the recent geo-political events have resulted in an increased level of uncertainty across various indices, thus impacting the assumptions and methodologies used in forecasting the inflation and life expectancy of members for future years.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of the BTPS defined benefit obligation has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 20) disclose the sensitivity of key assumptions for the obligation estimated by the Group.\n\n## Our response - our procedures included:\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: Challenging, with the support of our own actuarial specialists, the life expectancy of the members, price inflation and discount rates used to determine the defined benefit obligation against independently developed assumptions using external market data.\n\nAssessing actuaries' credentials: Evaluating the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group's external experts who assisted in determining the actuarial assumptions used to determine the defined benefit obligation.\n\nAssessing transparency: Considering the adequacy of the Group's disclosures in respect of the sensitivity of the obligation to these assumptions.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the resulting estimate of the BTPS defined benefit obligation to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).\n\n## Accuracy of revenue due to the complexity of the billing systems\n\nCertain revenue streams: included within total revenue of \u00a320.9billion (2021: \u00a321.3 billion)\n\n## Risk vs 2021: same\n\nRefer to pages 140 to 143 (financial disclosures note 5 Revenue).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Processing error\n\nBT non-long-term contract revenue consists of a large number of low value transactions. The Group operates a number of distinct billing systems and the IT landscape underpinning revenue and linking the billing systems together is complex.\n\nThere are multiple products sold at multiple rates with varying price structures in place. Products represent a combination of service based products, such as fixed line telephony, as well as goods, such as the provision of mobile handsets. There are monthly tariff charges.\n\nThe revenue recognition of non-long-term contract revenue is not subject to significant judgement. However, due to the large number of transactions and complexity of the billing systems, this is considered to be an area of most significance in our audit.\n\n## Our response\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\nProcess understanding: Obtaining an understanding of the revenue processes by observing transactions from customer initiation to cash received for certain material revenue streams.\n\nTest of details: Comparing a sample of revenue transactions, including credit notes, to supporting evidence e.g. customer bills, orders, price lists, contractual terms, proof of service and cash received (all where applicable).\n\nWe performed the detailed tests above rather than seeking to rely on the Group's controls because our knowledge of the design of these controls indicated that we would be unlikely to obtain the required evidence to support reliance on controls.",

However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, these are considered to be the areas that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\n## Our response Our procedures included:\n\nTest of details: Comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investment and loans to Group undertakings, with the relevant subsidiary balance sheet to identify whether its net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, was in excess of its carrying amount and assessing whether that subsidiary group has historically been profit-making.\n\nComparing valuations: Comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investment and loans to Group undertakings, with the market capitalisation of the Group.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the carrying amounts of the investment in subsidiary and debt due from Group entities to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).\n\n## 3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3100 million (2021: \u00a3105 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax from continuing operations normalised by averaging over the last 5 years due to fluctuations as a result of Covid-19, of \u00a32,265 million (2021: benchmark of group profit before tax from continuing operations of \u00a32,359 million), of which it represents 4.4% (2021: 4.5%).\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a395 million (2021: \u00a395 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of total assets, of which it represents 0.8% (2021: 0.8%), and chosen to be lower than materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole.\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality was set at 65% (2021: 65%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a365 million (2021: \u00a368 million) for the Group and \u00a361.75 million (2021: \u00a361.75 million) for the parent company. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the level of identified control deficiencies during the prior years.\n\nWe agreed to report the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a35 million (2021: \u00a35.25 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nConsistent with prior year, we define components of the Group based on legal entity and have determined our audit scope predominately on the same basis. Of the Group's 234 (2021: 233) reporting components, we subjected 5 (2021: 4) to full scope audits for Group purposes. Work on the Group's entire property, plant and equipment balance was performed by the Group audit team on behalf of the Group and component teams.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages:\n\n|                                      | Group  revenue   | Group  profit  before tax   | Group   total   assets   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Audits for group reporting  purposes | 90%              | 83%                         | 97%                      |\n| 2021                                 | 87%              | 78%                         | 95%                      |\n\nThe remaining 10% (2021: 13%) of total Group revenue, 17% (2021: 22%) of Group profit before tax and 3% (2021: 5%) of total Group assets is represented by 229 (2021: 229) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 6% (2021: 6%) of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group assets. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to reexamine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.",

        "page_content": "The work on all components, excluding the audit of BT Italy, was performed by the Group audit team. The parent company was also audited by the Group audit team. The Group team instructed the BT Italy component auditor as to the significant areas to be covered, including the risks identified above and the information to be reported back.\n\nThe Group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a320 million to \u00a385 million (2021: \u00a325 million to \u00a390 million), having regard to the mix and size and risk profile of the Group across components.\n\nThe Group audit team met frequently on video conference meetings with the BT Italy component audit team as part of the audit planning and completion stages to explain our audit instructions and discuss the component auditor's plans as well as performing file reviews upon the completion of the component auditor's engagement.\n\nAt these meetings with component auditors, the findings reported to the Group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team was then performed by the component auditor.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## 4. The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has pledged in the Strategic reports to be a net-zero business by 2030 and has also outlined several shorter-term climate change targets. Furthermore, the Group has mentioned its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Further information has been provided in the Group's Strategic Report on page 66 .\n\nAs a part of our audit, we have performed a risk assessment, including enquiries of management, to understand how the impact of commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change, as well as the physical and transition risks of climate change, may affect the financial statements and our audit.\n\nThe potential impacts of these matters relate to the forwardlooking estimates, which include projections for impairment assessment of goodwill, useful economic life of vehicle fleet and infrastructure impacting on future depreciation charges, and significant assumptions used in pension asset valuations. Taking into account our risk assessment procedures, the headroom on goodwill, the remaining useful economic lives of relevant assets and the nature of the assumptions used in the pension asset valuation, we have assessed that there is not a significant risk to the balances in the financial statements as a result of climate change. Therefore, there was no material impact on the Group's critical accounting estimates and our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the disclosures of climate related information in the annual report and considered their consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures in the Annual Report.\n\n## 5. Going concern\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of prolonged stagflation driven by geo-political factors and Covid-19 persistence;\n- \u00b7 The impact of an industrial action and international trade sanctions;\n- \u00b7 The impact of a significant supply chain disruptions driven by the geo-political factors;\n- \u00b7 The impact of an increased level of financial market volatility and deterioration of BT's covenant triggers on the funding obligation of BT Pension Scheme;\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as a large scale cyber breach or adverse changes to telecoms regulation which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 115 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations ability to detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading Board, Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee minutes;\n- \u00b7 considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and directors including the EPS target for management remuneration;\n- \u00b7 using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, recent revisions to guidance and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries.\n\nOn this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because non-long-term contract revenues are not judgemental and consist of a high number of low value transactions, and long-term contracts are generally low in complexity with most having a revenue recognition profile aligned to billing.\n\nWe did not identify any additional fraud risks.\n\nWe performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management, those posted and approved by the same user and those posted to unusual or seldom used accounts;\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the business purpose for significant unusual transactions.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the Group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of noncompliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, regulations affecting telecommunication providers, and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities (including compliance with Ofcom regulation) and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nWe discussed with the audit committee other matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.",

        "page_content": "## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 7. We have nothing to report on the other information in the Annual Report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the Annual Report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- \u00b7 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' confirmation within the Viability statement on page 70 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 the Principal Risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation in the Viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability statement, set out on page 70 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.",

We have nothing to report in this respect.\n\n## 8. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent Company financial statements and the part of the directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 9. Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 114 , the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by the Company. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and the further matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the terms agreed with the Company, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## John Luke\n\nfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor Chartered Accountants\n\n15 Canada Square London E14 5GL 12 May 2022",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation\n\n## Preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on page 70 , in estimating the financial impact of a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually, in combination and through probabilistic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the group and parent company financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2023, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's and parent company's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks.\n\nThese financial statements consolidate BT Group plc, the parent company, and its subsidiaries (together the 'group', 'us', 'we' or 'our').\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of BT Group plc.\n\nThese financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 ('FY22'), with comparative figures for the financial year from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021 ('FY21').\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThe following amended standards and interpretations were effective during the year, however, they have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)\n- \u00b7 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to IFRS 16)\n\n## Software as a Service\n\nWe previously capitalised certain configuration and customisation costs associated with software as a service arrangements as intangible assets. In its April 2021 agenda decision, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) clarified that such costs should be expensed where the entity does not control the software being configured. We have adopted the treatment set out by the IFRIC in its agenda decision. The impact of this on the group was not material.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) with Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) began from December 2021. Where floating interest bearing receivables and payables exist, and where IBOR was previously applicable, the Group began applying suitable replacement benchmark rates and now account for the instruments in accordance with the amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (Phase 1) and 2020 (Phase 2). The adoption of these amendments and the transition to ARRs will not have a material financial impact. The implications on the trading results of our segments from the IBOR reform have also been assessed and the expected impact is not material. The Group will move to the new benchmark rates in accordance with timelines as per the regulatory guidelines.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective\n\nThe following new or amended standards and interpretations are applicable in future periods:\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 for onerous contracts\n\nThe amendments to IAS 37 specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. For BT this will be from next financial year. At the date of initial application, the cumulative effect of applying the amendments will be recognised as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings as at 1 April 2022. The comparatives will not be restated. The Group is in the process of finalising the impact of the standard. We do not expect the impact on adoption to be material.\n\n## IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nWe are in the process of assessing the impact of adopting this standard which is effective for BT from 1 April 2023.\n\n## Other\n\nThe following are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Disclosure of Accounting Policies (amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS practice statement 2)\n- \u00b7 Definition of Accounting Estimate (amendments to IAS 8)\n- \u00b7 Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction (amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes)\n- \u00b7 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n\n## Presentation of specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items ('adjusted'). The directors believe that presentation of our results in this way is relevant to an understanding of our financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our trading results. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.",

Examples of charges or credits which meet the above definition include acquisitions or disposals of businesses and investments, historical regulatory penalties or litigation claims, business restructuring programmes including our current group-wide modernisation programme, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes including our Better Workplace programme, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years. In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items.\n\nSpecific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 9.\n\n## 2. Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying our accounting policies. We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience. As the use of estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates that carry a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We also make other key estimates when preparing the financial statements, which, while not meeting the definition of a critical estimate, involve a higher degree of complexity and can reasonably be expected to be of relevance to a user of the financial statements. Management has discussed its critical and other key accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nSignificant judgements are those made by management in applying our significant accounting policies that have a material impact on the amounts presented in the financial statements. We may exercise significant judgement in our critical and key accounting estimates.\n\nOur critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements are described in the following notes to the financial statements. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\n| Note                                                        | Critical  estimate   | Key  estimate   | Significant  judgement   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| 10.

Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are set out below. Other significant accounting policies applicable to a particular area are disclosed in the most relevant note. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\nWe have applied all policies consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries, and include its share of the results of associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The group recognises its direct rights to (and its share of) jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations under the appropriate headings in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. No material acquisitions were made in the year.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another entity, known as the parent or investor. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries, which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original business combination and non-controlling share of changes in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the group's financial statements.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from and up to the date of change of control. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned with the policies adopted by the group. All intra-group transactions including any gains or losses, balances, income or expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\nWhen the group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item.\n\n## Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment to be sold to customers are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value, taking into account expected revenue from the sale of packages comprising a mobile handset and a subscription. Cost corresponds to purchase or production cost determined by either the first in first out (FIFO) or average cost method.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 3. Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements continued\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with the grants have been complied with and the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase or production of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the related assets and reduce future depreciation expense accordingly. Grants for the reimbursement of operating expenditure are deducted from the related category of costs in the income statement. Estimates and judgements applied in accounting for government grants received in respect of BDUK and other rural superfast broadband contracts are described in note 14.\n\nOnce a government grant is recognised, any related deferred income is treated in accordance with IAS 20 'Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance'.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the transaction dates (unless it is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effects, in which case income and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year). Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign undertakings are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference associated with the undertaking in the translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure, including the cost of internally developed software, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group from the asset being developed, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.\n\nCapitalisation ceases when the asset being developed is ready for use. Research and development costs include direct and indirect labour, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits (leaver costs) are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. We recognise termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to the affected employees leaving the group.",

Segment information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to segment information\n\n## Operating and reportable segments\n\nOur operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Executive Committee, which is the key management committee and represents the 'chief operating decision maker'.\n\nOur organisational structure reflects the different customer groups to which we provide communications products and services via our customer-facing units (CFUs): Consumer, Enterprise, Global and Openreach. The CFUs are supported by technology units (TUs) comprising Digital and Networks; and corporate units (CUs) including procurement and property management.\n\nThe CFUs are our reportable segments and generate substantially all of our revenue. TUs and CUs are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' for any of the years presented.\n\nWe aggregate the remaining operations and include within the 'Other' category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group. The 'Other' category includes unallocated TU costs and our CUs.\n\n## Allocation of certain items to segments\n\nProvisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the 'Other' segment. On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the results of the relevant CFU and offset in the group results through the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the 'Other' segment. Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the definition of specific items as detailed in note 9.\n\nThe costs incurred by TUs and CUs are recharged to the CFUs to reflect the services it provides to them. Depreciation and amortisation incurred by TUs in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the CFUs is allocated to the CFUs based on their respective utilisation. Capital expenditure incurred by TUs for specific projects undertaken on behalf of the CFUs is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred. Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular CFU, capital expenditure is allocated between them based on the proportion of estimated future economic benefits.\n\nSpecific items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reflects how they are reported to the Executive Committee. Finance expense and income are not allocated to the reportable segments, as the central treasury function manages this activity, together with the overall net debt position of the group.\n\n## Measuring segment performance\n\nPerformance of each reportable segment is measured based on adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items, net non-interest related finance expense, and share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the CFUs because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specific items, which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nOur revenue recognition policy is set out in Note 5.\n\n## Internal revenue and costs\n\nMost of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the CFUs, including the use of BT Ireland's network. This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through TUs which are included within the 'Other' segment. Enterprise internal revenue arises from Consumer for mobile Ethernet access and TUs for transmission planning services. Internal revenue arising in Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services. Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price. Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant CFUs and therefore the profitability of CFUs may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.\n\n## Geographic segmentation\n\nThe UK is our country of domicile and we generate the majority of our revenue from external customers in the UK. The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country of origin in which the customer is invoiced. The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which exclude derivative financial instruments, investments and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Revenue continued\n\nWe recognise revenue based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Determining the standalone selling price often requires judgement and may be derived from regulated prices, list prices, a cost-plus derived price, or the price of similar products when sold on a standalone basis by BT or a competitor. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the contract price when this represents a bespoke price that would be the same for a similar customer in a similar circumstance.\n\nThe fixed access and mobile subscription arrangements sold by our Consumer business are typically payable in advance, with any variable or one-off charges billed in arrears. Payment is received immediately for direct sales of equipment to customers. Where equipment is provided to customers under mobile and fixed access subscription arrangements, payment for the equipment is received over the course of the contract term. For sales by our enterprise businesses, invoices are issued in line with contractual terms. Payments received in advance are recognised as contract liabilities, amounts billed in arrears are recognised as contract assets.\n\nWe are applying the practical expedient to recognise revenue 'as-invoiced' for certain fixed access and mobile subscription services revenues. Where we have a right to invoice at an amount that directly corresponds with performance to date, we recognise revenue at that amount. We have also adopted the practical expedient not to calculate the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied for these contracts.\n\nWe do not have any material obligations in respect of returns, refunds or warranties. Where we act as an agent in a transaction, such as insurance services offered, we recognise commission net of directly attributable costs. Where the actual and estimated costs to completion of the contract exceed the estimated revenue, a loss is recognised immediately.\n\nWe exercise judgement in assessing whether the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contracts are distinct from the other services to be delivered under the contract and therefore represent distinct performance obligations. This determines whether revenue is recognised in the early stages of the contract, or deferred until delivery of the other services promised in the contract begins.\n\nWe recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable. If these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable. We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate. Key factors reviewed include:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.\n- \u00b7 Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.\n- \u00b7 The status of commercial relations with customers and the implications for future revenue and cost projections.\n- \u00b7 Our estimates of future staff and third-party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.\n\n## Revenue from lease arrangements in scope of IFRS 16\n\nSome consumer broadband and TV products and arrangements to provide external communications providers with exclusive use of Openreach's fixed-network telecommunications infrastructure meet the definition of operating leases under IFRS 16.\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains a lease following the accounting policy set out in note 15. Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease in which we act as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases at lease inception based on an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case then the lease is a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. For sub-leases, we make this assessment by reference to the characteristics of the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease rather than the underlying leased asset.\n\nIncome from arrangements classified as operating leases is presented as revenue where it relates to our core operating activities, for example leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers and leases of devices to consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription products. Operating lease income from other arrangements is presented within other operating income (note 6).\n\nWe recognise operating lease payments as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any upfront payments received, such as connection fees, are deferred over the lease term. Determining the lease term is subject to the significant judgements set out in note 15.\n\nWhere the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the transaction price is allocated between the components on the basis of relative stand-alone selling price.\n\nWhere an arrangement is assessed as a finance lease we derecognise the underlying asset and recognise a receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease. The receivable is measured based on future payments to be received discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, adjusted for any direct costs. Any difference between the derecognised asset and the finance lease receivable is recognised in the income statement. Where the nature of services delivered relates to our core operating activities it is presented as revenue. Where it relates to non-core activities it is presented within other operating income (note 6).",

Of this, \u00a37,108m (FY21: \u00a37,415m) relates to ICT and managed services contracts and equipment and other services which will substantially be recognised as revenue within three years. Fixed access and mobile subscription services typically have shorter contract periods and so \u00a36,394m (FY21: \u00a35,902m) will substantially be recognised as revenue within two years.\n\nRevenue recognised this year relating to performance obligations that were satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous years was not material. Revenue related to customers' unexercised rights (for example, unused amounts on prepaid SIM cards) was not material.\n\n## Lease income\n\nPresented within revenue is \u00a32,745m (FY21: \u00a32,496m) income from arrangements classified as operating leases under IFRS 16 and which represent core business activities for the group. Income relates predominantly to Openreach's leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers, classified as fixed access subscription revenue in the table above, and leases of devices to Consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription offerings, classified as equipment and other services.\n\nDuring the year we also recognised \u00a333m (FY21: \u00a336m) operating lease income from non-core business activities which is presented in other operating income (note 6). This income relates primarily to sub-leases of unutilised properties.\n\nNote 15 presents an analysis of payments to be received across the remaining term of operating lease arrangements.\n\nWe did not enter into any material finance lease arrangements during the year. In FY21 we renegotiated a non-strategic revenue contract delivered using elements of our leased buildings infrastructure, in exchange for an up-front payment of \u00a3196m. The revised arrangement, previously classified as an operating sub-lease, was reassessed as a finance sub-lease in line with the accounting policy set out above. We derecognised the \u00a3208m carrying amount of the associated right-of-use asset and a net deferred income balance of \u00a333m previously reported within trade and other payables, and recognised in revenue a gain on disposal of \u00a321m, consistent with the presentation of the previous operating lease income. As no further amounts were due, no finance lease receivable was recognised.",

Revenue continued\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to contract assets and liabilities\n\nWe recognise contract assets for goods and services for which control has transferred to the customer before consideration is due. These assets mainly relate to mobile handsets provided upfront but paid for over the course of a contract. Contract assets are reclassified as receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional and we have billed the customer.\n\nContract liabilities are recognised when we have received advance payment for goods and services that we have not transferred to the customer. These primarily relate to fees received for connection and installation services that are not distinct performance obligations.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition or transformation phase of a long-term contract is considered to be a distinct performance obligation we recognise a contract asset for any work performed but not billed. Conversely a contract liability is recognised where these activities are not distinct performance obligations and we receive upfront consideration. In this case eligible costs associated with delivering these services are capitalised as fulfilment costs, see note 17.\n\nWe provide for expected lifetime losses on contract assets following the policy set out in note 17.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities are as follows:\n\n| Year ended 31 March   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Contract assets       |           |           |\n| Current               | 1,554     | 1,515     |\n| Non-current           | 361       | 344       |\n|                       | 1,915     | 1,859     |\n| Contract liabilities  |           |           |\n| Current               | 833       | 925       |\n| Non-current           | 170       | 167       |\n|                       | 1,003     | 1,092     |\n\n\u00a3880m of the contract liability at 31 March 2021 was recognised as revenue during the year (FY21: \u00a3886m). Impairment losses of \u00a348m were recognised on contract assets during the year (FY21: \u00a347m).\n\nThe expected credit loss provisions recognised against contract assets vary across the group due to the nature of our customers; the expected loss rate at 31 March 2022 was 3% (FY21: 4%).",

As a result we have refined the classification of costs within the operating costs disclosure for FY22. Improved data has allowed us to better allocate subcontractor costs to indirect labour costs, and allocate more costs to named cost categories as opposed to within other operating costs. Following detailed analysis of the underlying causes of reallocations we have concluded they are not indicative of material errors in previously published financial data including the FY21 comparatives.",

Specific items\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include business restructuring programmes, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific.\n\nIn FY20 we included the impacts of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items as at 31 March 2020 as specific. Any releases to this provision have been released through specific items in FY21 and FY22. The impact of Covid-19 on underlying trading is recognised in our underlying (adjusted) results and not as a specific item.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                               | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                           |           |           |\n| Retrospective regulatory matters                  | (5)       | 39        |\n|                                                   | (5)       | 39        |\n| Operating costs                                   |           |           |\n| Restructuring charges                             | 347       | 421       |\n| Divestment-related items                          | (36)      | (60)      |\n| Covid-19                                          | (19)      | (17)      |\n| Retrospective regulatory matters                  | -         | (4)       |\n| Settlement with Dixons Carphone                   | -         | 149       |\n| Sale of spectrum                                  | -         | (66)      |\n| Property rationalisation                          | -         | 19        |\n|                                                   | 292       | 442       |\n| Operating loss                                    | 287       | 481       |\n| Net finance expense                               |           |           |\n| Divestment-related items                          | 8         | -         |\n| Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation | 93        | 18        |\n|                                                   | 101       | 18        |\n| Net specific items charge before tax              | 388       | 499       |\n| Taxation                                          |           |           |\n| Tax credit on specific items above                | (80)      | (96)      |\n| Tax charge on re-measurement of deferred tax      | 420       | -         |\n|                                                   | 340       | (96)      |\n| Net specific items charge after tax               | 728       | 403       |",

Specific items continued\n\n## Retrospective regulatory matters\n\nWe recognised a net credit of \u00a35m (FY21: net charge of \u00a335m) in relation to historic regulatory matters, recognised in revenue. This reflects the movement in provisions relating to various matters.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\nIn the year we have incurred charges of \u00a3347m (FY21: \u00a3421m), primarily relating to leaver costs, staff costs where colleagues are working exclusively on transformation programmes, and consultancy costs. These costs reflect projects within our Group-wide modernisation programme, first announced in May 2020, which will deliver gross annualised cost benefits of \u00a32.5bn by FY25, at an expected cost of \u00a31.3bn. \u00a30.8bn costs have been incurred to date.\n\n## Divestment-related items\n\nWe recognised a credit of \u00a336m (FY21: \u00a360m). This primarily relates to a gain on disposal of \u00a343m relating to the sale of Diamond IP, a non-core software business in America. This was offset by an \u00a38m loss on disposal of business units in Italy serving customers in the public administration and SME sectors. There were also some small true-up charges on previous transactions and costs relating to ongoing divestment projects. A charge of \u00a38m (FY21: \u00a3nil) was also recognised in finance expense relating to a hedge which became ineffective due to divestment activity.\n\nIn FY21 we completed the sale of our domestic operations in Spain and recorded a net gain of \u00a380m. We also incurred net losses on the disposal of our domestic operations in Latin America and France of \u00a311m and recognised \u00a39m of other divestment related costs, including an additional \u00a34m loss on disposal of a number of other businesses.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nIn FY20 we recognised one-off charges of \u00a395m relating to the impact of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items. Any releases of this provision have also been booked as a specific item. During FY22 we released \u00a319m (FY21: \u00a317m) of these provisions which were not needed. At 31 March 2022 we retained \u00a312m (31 March 2021: \u00a355m) of provisions related to Covid-19.\n\n## Settlement with Dixons Carphone\n\nIn FY21, following the expiry of the retail agreement between Dixons Carphone and EE Limited, we mutually agreed to resolve all outstanding matters which primarily related to contingent revenue share costs that could have previously been recognised over future years. The associated cost of \u00a3149m which includes the agreed cash payment and the write-off of balance sheet prepayments and accruals was treated as a specific item in the FY21 results. The associated cash payment was made in April 2021.\n\n## Sale of spectrum\n\nIn FY21 we sold 25 MHz of unpaired 2.6 GHz spectrum and recognised a gain on disposal of \u00a366m as a specific item.\n\n## Property rationalisation costs\n\nIn FY21, we recognised costs of \u00a319m relating to rationalisation of our property portfolio under our Better Workplace programme. In FY22, property rationalisation costs have been classified as restructuring charges where they fall under the previously announced transformation programme.\n\n## Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation\n\nDuring the year we incurred \u00a393m (FY21: \u00a318m) of interest costs in relation to our defined benefit pension obligations.\n\n## Tax on specific items\n\nA tax credit of \u00a380m (FY21: \u00a396m) was recognised in relation to specific items.\n\n## Remeasurement of deferred tax balances\n\nWe have remeasured our deferred tax balances following the enactment of the new UK corporation tax rate of 25% from April 2023. The corresponding adjustment comprises a net tax charge of \u00a3420m in the income statement and a non-recurring tax credit of \u00a3298m in the statement of comprehensive income. This is classified as a specific item due to its size and the out of period nature of this charge.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 10. Taxation\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to taxation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCurrent income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income. We periodically evaluate positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation, and establish provisions where appropriate on the basis of the amounts expected to be paid to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, in the foreseeable future against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for taxation\n\nWe seek to pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business. However, in some areas these laws are unclear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation. We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases. Our key uncertainties are whether EE's tax losses will be available to us, whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority and whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes. We provide for the predicted outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates. Approximately 81% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months. \u00a3194m (FY21: \u00a3200m) is included in current tax liabilities or offset against current tax assets where netting is appropriate.\n\nUnder a downside case an additional amount of \u00a3543m could be required to be paid, of which \u00a3444m would relate to EE losses. This amount is not provided as we don't consider this outcome to be probable.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental. We only recognise them when we consider it is probable that they can be recovered. In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.\n\nThe value of the group's income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the group balance sheet. The value of the group's deferred tax assets and liabilities is disclosed below.\n\n## Analysis of our taxation expense for the year\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                            | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| United Kingdom                                                 |           |           |\n| Corporation tax at 19% (FY21: 19%)                             | -         | (300)     |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years a                      | 223       | 6         |\n| Non-UK taxation                                                |           |           |\n| Current                                                        | (78)      | (65)      |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years                        | 7         | 6         |\n| Total current taxation (expense)                               | 152       | (353)     |\n| Deferred taxation                                              |           |           |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences              | (102)     | 6         |\n| Adjustments in respect of earlier years a                      | (190)     | 12        |\n| Impact of change in UK corporation tax rate to 25% (FY21: 19%) | (420)     | -         |\n| Remeasurement of temporary differences                         | (129)     | 3         |\n| Total deferred taxation (expense) / credit                     | (841)     | 21        |\n| Total taxation (expense)                                       | (689)     | (332)     |\n\n- a  During the period certain prior period tax issues were resolved at a net tax cost of \u00a369m, comprising a \u00a3263m deferred tax charge and a \u00a3194m current tax credit.",

These enhanced deductions are available for FY22 and FY23, driving a projected UK tax loss and no UK tax payments for these periods. These deductions together with accelerated deductions relating to pension contributions result in c.\u00a35bn of tax losses expected to be carried forward from FY23.\n\n## What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?\n\nAt 31 March 2022 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a33.8bn (FY21: \u00a34.1bn). Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below:\n\n| At 31 March 2022              | \u00a3m    | Expiry      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Restricted losses             |       |             |\n| Europe                        | 1     | 2022 - 2025 |\n| Americas                      | 368   | 2022 - 2045 |\n| Other                         | 3     | 2022 - 2030 |\n| Total restricted losses       | 372   |             |\n| Unrestricted operating losses | 3,095 | No expiry   |\n| Other temporary differences   | 313   | No expiry   |\n| Total                         | 3,780 |             |",

Taxation continued\n\nAt 31 March 2022 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a316.8bn (FY21: \u00a316.8bn). These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of significant amounts of these losses to be remote.\n\nAt 31 March 2022 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were \u00a31.9bn (FY21: \u00a31.8bn). No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise. Under current tax rules, tax of \u00a335m (FY21: \u00a343m) would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.\n\n## 11. Earnings per share\n\n## How is earnings per share calculated?\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic weighted average number of shares (millions)   | 9,866  | 9,905  |\n| Dilutive shares from share options (millions)        | 105    | 30     |\n| Dilutive shares from share awards (millions)         | 165    | 137    |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) | 10,136 | 10,072 |\n| Basic earnings per share                             | 12.9p  | 14.8p  |\n| Diluted earnings per share                           | 12.5p  | 14.6p  |\n\nThe earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests. Profit after tax was \u00a31,274m (FY21: \u00a31,472m) and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was \u00a32m (FY21: \u00a33m). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.\n\n## 12. Dividends\n\n## What is the group's dividend policy?\n\nWe have a progressive dividend policy to maintain or grow the dividend each year whilst taking into consideration a number of factors including underlying medium-term earnings expectations and levels of business reinvestment.\n\n## What dividends have been paid?\n\nA final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to approximately \u00a3528m is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022 (FY21: no final dividend paid). An interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3227m was paid on 7 February 2022 (FY21: no interim dividend paid). This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.\n\nNo dividends were paid in the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n|                                                 | 2022             | 2022   | 2021             | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------|------------------|--------|\n| Year ended 31 March                             | pence per  share | \u00a3m     | pence per  share | \u00a3m     |\n| Interim dividend in respect of the current year | 2.31             | 227    | -                | -      |",

Intangible assets\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe recognise identifiable intangible assets where we control the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the group, and we can reliably measure the cost of the asset. We amortise all intangible assets, other than goodwill, over their useful economic life. The method of amortisation reflects the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight line method is used.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) of the acquired business. Our goodwill impairment policy is set out later in this note.\n\n## Acquired intangible assets - customer relationships and brands\n\nIntangible assets such as customer relationships or brands acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of these relationships or brands and include management's estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by them.\n\n## Telecommunications licences\n\nLicence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period or where our usage can extend beyond the initial licence period, over the period we expect to benefit from the use of the licences, which is typically 20 years. Licences acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. The fair value is based on management's assumption of future cash flows using market expectations at acquisition date.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software comprises computer software licences purchased from third parties, and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost. We only capitalise costs directly associated with the production of internally developed software, including direct and indirect labour costs of development, where it is probable that the software will generate future economic benefits, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs which do not meet these criteria and research costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nOur development costs which give rise to internally developed software include upgrading the network architecture or functionality and developing service platforms aimed at offering new services to our customers.\n\n## Other\n\nOther intangible assets include website development costs and other licences. Items are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic life or the term of the contract.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful economic lives assigned to the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Computer software\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- \u2022 Telecommunications licences\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n- \u2022 Customer relationships and brands\n\n1 to 15 years\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash generating unit and the fair value less costs to dispose.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as described below. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, as a specific item. If a cash generating unit is impaired, impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro-rata basis against intangible and other assets.",

Intangible assets continued\n\nImpairment of goodwill\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to impairment of goodwill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment review.\n\nGoodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit (CGU) level. These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer, Enterprise, and Global.\n\nWe allocate goodwill to each of the CGUs that we expect to benefit from the business combination. Each CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period. They reflect management's expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance. Cash flows beyond the fifth year have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in reviewing goodwill for impairment\n\n## Determining our CGUs\n\nThe determination of our CGUs is judgemental. The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows. This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams. During the year we have reviewed our CGUs and have brought together the Legacy BT Consumer and Legacy EE CGUs into a combined 'Consumer' CGU, aligning our CGUs to our CFUs, due to increased convergence between the prior CGUs such that cash inflows are no longer independent.\n\n## Estimating value in use\n\nOur value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including management's expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows, and the discount rate for each CGU. Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are based on our latest Board-approved five-year financial plans. Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.\n\nWe tested our goodwill for impairment as at 31 March 2022. The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used in performing the annual impairment assessment and sensitivities are disclosed below.\n\nLegacy BT\n\n| Cost                               | Consumer \u00a3m   | Consumer \u00a3m   | Legacy EE \u00a3m   | Enterprise \u00a3m   | Global \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2020                    | -             | 1,183         | 2,768          | 3,483           | 511         | 7,945      |\n| Exchange differences               | -             | -             | -              | (8)             | (100)       | (108)      |\n| Acquisitions and disposals         | -             | -             | -              | -               | 1           | 1          |\n| At 31 March 2021                   | -             | 1,183         | 2,768          | 3,475           | 412         | 7,838      |\n| Transfer                           | 3,951         | (1,183)       | (2,768)        | -               | -           | -          |\n| Exchange differences               | -             | -             | -              | 4               | 39          | 43         |\n| Acquisitions and disposals         | -             | -             | -              | 94              | (7)         | 87         |\n| Transfer to assets held for sale a | (51)          | -             | -              | -               | -           | (51)       |\n| At 31 March 2022                   | 3,900         | -             | -              | 3,573           | 444         | 7,917      |\n\n- a  Assets transferred to held for sale during FY22 relate to our BT Sport operations.

The assumptions used in the calculation of the group's weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data. The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in FY22 was 7.6% (FY21: 8.1%).

Intangible assets continued\n\n## What growth rates have we used?\n\nThe perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets. None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected average long-term growth rates for those markets or sectors. We used a perpetuity growth rate of 2.3% (FY21: 2.3%) for Global and 2.0% (FY21: 2.0%) for Enterprise and Consumer.\n\n## What sensitivities have we applied?\n\nThere is significant headroom in all of our CGUs, such that at this point in time there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would result in an impairment.\n\n## 14. Property, plant and equipment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to property, plant and equipment\n\nOur property, plant and equipment is included at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation, government grants and any impairment charges. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for on the same basis as our existing assets. We derecognise items of property, plant and equipment on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the date of disposal is recognised in operating costs in the income statement.\n\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure and equipment are direct and indirect labour costs, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight line basis from the time the asset is available for use, to write off the asset's cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term leasehold improvements\n- \u00b7 Freehold buildings\n- \u00b7 Leasehold land and buildings\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nTransmission equipment\n\n40 years\n\n- \u2022 Cable\n\n3 to 25 years\n\n- \u2022 Fibre\n\n5 to 20 years\n\nExchange equipment\n\n2 to 13 years\n\nOther network equipment\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n## Other assets\n\n- \u2022 Motor vehicles\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- \u2022 Computers and office equipment\n\n3 to 7 years\n\n- \u00b7 Duct\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are recognised prospectively. In FY22 we have updated the useful lives of motor vehicles from 2-9 to 2-10 years following a review of our specialised vehicle fleet.\n\n## Network share assets\n\nCertain assets have been contributed to a network share arrangement by both EE and Hutchison 3G UK Limited, with legal title remaining with the contributor. This is considered to be a reciprocal arrangement. Our share of the assets on acquisition of EE were recognised at fair value within tangible assets, and depreciated in line with policy. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\nWe test property, plant and equipment for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, we assess the recoverable amount by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant asset and the fair value less costs to dispose. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for the individual asset then we assess impairment by reference to the relevant cash generating unit as described in note 13.\n\n14 to 50 years\n\nShorter of 10 years or lease term\n\nUnexpired portion of lease or 40 years, whichever is the shorter",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Building Digital UK (BDUK) government grants\n\nWe receive government grants in relation to BDUK and other rural superfast broadband contracts. Where we have achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, we have an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding. Where this is the case, we recognise deferred income in respect of the funding that will be re-invested or repaid, and make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment.\n\nAssessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable. Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long-term take-up trend.\n\nOur assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up. The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 18.\n\n|                                    |                        | Network infrastructure   | Network infrastructure   |            |                               |          |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------|-------------------------------|----------|\n|                                    | Land and  buildings \u00a3m | Held by  Openreach \u00a3m    | Held by  other units \u00a3m  | Other a \u00a3m | Assets under  construction \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Cost                               |                        |                          |                          |            |                               |          |\n| At 1 April 2020                    | 945                    | 27,152                   | 26,741                   | 1,662      | 916                           | 57,416   |\n| Additions b                        | 10                     | (179)                    | 114                      | 69         | 3,401                         | 3,415    |\n| Transfers                          | 32                     | 2,151                    | 972                      | 141        | (3,305)                       | (9)      |\n| Disposals and adjustments c        | (19)                   | (16)                     | (2,193)                  | (333)      | (21)                          | (2,582)  |\n| Exchange differences               | (22)                   | -

These relate to shared 3G network and certain elements of network for 4G rural sites. The net book value of the group's share of assets controlled by its joint operation MBNL is \u00a3562m (FY21: \u00a3625m) and is recorded within network infrastructure. Included within this is \u00a373m (FY21: \u00a395m), being the group's share of assets owned by its joint operation MBNL.\n\nWithin network infrastructure are assets with a net book value of \u00a310.3bn (FY21: \u00a39.8bn) which have useful economic lives of more than 18 years. The prior year comparative has been restated from \u00a310.3bn to exclude intangible licences associated with our network infrastructure.\n\n## 15. Leases\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to leases\n\n## Identifying whether a lease exists\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains a lease. A lease exists if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for consideration. In making this assessment, we consider whether:\n\n- \u00b7 The contract involves the use of an identified asset, either explicitly or implicitly. The asset must be physically distinct or represent substantially all the capacity of a physically distinct asset. Assets that a supplier has a substantive right to substitute are not considered distinct.\n- \u00b7 The lessee (either the group, or the group's customers) has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n- \u00b7 The lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset, in other words, has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nWhere practicable, and by class of underlying asset, we have elected to account for leases containing a lease component and one or more non-lease components as a single lease component. Where this election has been taken, it has been applied to the entire asset.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nWe recognise a lease liability and right-of-use asset at the commencement of a lease.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are due over the lease term, discounted using the group's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for the impact of any extension options that we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise, or termination options that we are reasonably certain the lessee will not exercise.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is the rate that we would have to pay for a loan of a similar term, and with similar security, to obtain an asset of similar value.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 15. Leases continued\n\nLease payments include:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of any purchase options that we are reasonably certain to exercise\n- \u00b7 payments due over optional renewal periods where we are reasonably certain to renew\n- \u00b7 penalties for early termination of the lease where we are reasonably certain to terminate early\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments, including changes in the index or rate used to determine those payments, or the amount we expect to be payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWe also remeasure lease liabilities where the lease term changes. This occurs when the non-cancellable period of the lease changes, or on occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances within the control of the lessee and which changes our initial assessment in regard to whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options. Where the lease term changes we remeasure the lease liability using the group's incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment. Where a significant event or change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term remains unchanged and the carrying amounts of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset will decline over time.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at the initial amount of the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepaid lease payments, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any decommissioning costs that have been recognised as provisions, less any lease incentives received. They are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment following the policy set out in note 14 and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nWe have elected not to recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases of low-value assets with a purchase price under \u00a35,000. We recognise lease payments associated with these items as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAny variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as usage-based payments, are recognised as an expense in the period to which the variability relates.\n\n## Significant judgements made in accounting for leases\n\nThe lease term is a key determinant of the size of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised where the group acts as lessee; and the deferral period for any upfront connection charges where the group acts as lessor. Determining the lease term requires judgement to evaluate whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options. Key facts and circumstances that create an incentive to exercise those options are considered, these include:\n\n- \u00b7 Our anticipated operational, retail and office property requirements in the mid and long-term.\n- \u00b7 The availability of suitable alternative sites.\n- \u00b7 Costs or penalties associated with exiting lease arrangements relative to the benefits to be gained, including costs of removing leasehold improvements or relocating, and indirect costs such as disruption to business.\n- \u00b7 Significant investments in leased sites, in particular those with useful lives beyond the lease term.\n- \u00b7 Costs associated with extending lease arrangements including rent increases during secondary lease periods.\n\nOur definition of 'reasonable certainty', and therefore the lease term, will often align with the judgements made in our mediumterm plan, in particular for leases of non-specialised property and equipment on rolling (or 'evergreen') arrangements that continue until terminated and which can be exited without significant penalty.\n\nFollowing initial determination of the lease term, we exercise judgement in evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances are sufficiently significant to change the initial assessment of whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options; and in the subsequent reassessment of the lease term.\n\n## Key judgements exercised in setting the lease term\n\nThe quantum of the lease liability and right-of-use asset currently recognised on our balance sheet is most significantly affected by the judgement exercised in setting the lease term for the arrangement under which the bulk of our operational UK property estate is held. Setting the lease term for our leased cell sites has also involved the use of judgement albeit to a lesser degree.",

        "page_content": "## 15. Leases continued\n\n## UK operational property portfolio\n\nSubstantially all of our leased property estate is held under an arrangement which can be terminated in 2031, at which point we may either vacate some or all properties; or purchase the entire estate. If neither option is taken the lease continues to the next unilaterally available break point in 2041. The lease liability recognised for the arrangement reflects a lease end date of 2031. On initial recognition we concluded that, although the majority of these properties are expected to be needed on a long-term basis, we couldn't be reasonably certain that we wouldn't exercise the termination option or that we would exercise the purchase option. In coming to this conclusion, we had due regard to material sub-lease arrangements relating to the estate.\n\nAs time progresses our assessment may change; if this happens, we will remeasure the lease liability and right-of-use asset to reflect either the rentals due for any properties we will continue to occupy, or the cost of purchasing the estate.\n\nOn remeasurement there would be an adjustment to both the lease liability and right-of-use asset, with no overall impact on net assets.\n\n- \u00b7 Exercising the purchase option would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn\n- \u00b7 Continuing to lease the estate beyond 2031 until the next available break in 2041 would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn\n\nOur assessment will be directly linked to future strategic decisions, which will be resolved at some time prior to 2031, around the development of the fixed network and the associated rationalisation of our exchange estate. The breadth of the ranges reflects the significant uncertainty around key variables used to determine cash outflows, especially future inflation and which properties the group will be able to exit prior to or in 2031.\n\nEstimates are based on discounted cash outflows and do not reflect the likely and significant impact of cash inflows generated from the disposal, repurposing or subleasing of properties retained post-2031.\n\nWe are permitted to hand a limited number of properties back to the lessor prior to 2031. On initial adoption of IFRS 16 we were not reasonably certain which properties would be handed back and as such the lease term did not reflect the exercise of these options. Subsequently we exercise judgement in identifying significant events that trigger reassessment of our initial conclusion. We exercise similar judgement in identifying events triggering reassessment of whether we are reasonably certain we will not exercise termination options associated with other leased properties.\n\nIn doing so we consider decisions associated with our ongoing workplace rationalisation programme, in particular decisions to exit a particular location or lease an alternative property. Generally we remain reasonably certain that we will not exercise a termination option until implementation of the associated business plan has progressed to a stage that we are committed to exiting the property. At that point we reassess the lease term by reference to the time we expect to remain in occupation of the property and any notice period associated with exercise of the option.\n\n## Cell sites\n\nMost of the liability recognised in respect of leased cell sites relates to multi-site arrangements with commercial providers. The fixed-term nature of these arrangements means it has not been necessary to exercise significant judgement when determining the lease term. Where the arrangements offer extension options we have been required to conclude whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Although the balance sheet could be materially affected by the conclusion reached in regard to these options, we have not been required to exercise a significant degree of judgement in arriving at the lease term having regard to the period of time covered by the options, the difficulty in predicting the group's long-term network requirements, and the relatively high threshold that 'reasonably certain' represents.\n\nA smaller proportion of the cell site liability relates to arrangements with individual landlords which are either rolling or can be exited with notice. When setting the initial lease term for these arrangements we exercised significant judgement in establishing the period that we are reasonably certain to require use of the site. We broadly aligned lease terms with our medium-term planning horizon after assessing the relative strengths of the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Long-term economic incentives to remain on sites including existing capital improvements;\n- \u00b7 A need to maintain flexibility in our ability to develop and manage our network infrastructure to react quickly to technological developments and evolving capacity requirements; and\n- \u00b7 Incentives to renegotiate arrangements in the medium term to gain more security over sites to support future capital investment.\n\nAlthough significant judgement has been exercised in determining the lease term, reaching an alternative conclusion would not have a material impact on the balance sheet having regard to the most feasible alternative lease terms.\n\nSubsequently, we consider key events that trigger reassessment of lease terms to be developments which resolve uncertainty around our economic incentive to remain on individual sites in the long term. These are primarily lease renegotiations and significant capital investments, for example that associated our 5G rollout and other capital refresh programmes.",

Programme rights\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to programme rights\n\nProgramme rights are recognised on the balance sheet from the point at which the legally enforceable licence period begins. They are accounted for as inventory and held at the lower of cost and net realisable value. They are initially recognised at cost and are consumed from the point at which they are available for use, on a straight line basis over the programming period, or the remaining licence term, as appropriate, which is generally 12 months.\n\nAdditions reflect TV programme rights for which the legally enforceable licence period has started during the year. Rights for which the licence period has not started are disclosed as contractual commitments in note 31. Payments made to receive commissioned or acquired programming in advance of the legal right to broadcast the programmes are classified as prepayments (see note 17).",

Trade and other receivables\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to trade and other receivables\n\nWe initially recognise trade and other receivables at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts receivable.\n\nWe provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers. Because of this, we recognise an allowance for doubtful debts on initial recognition of receivables, which is deducted from the gross carrying amount of the receivable. The allowance is calculated by reference to credit losses expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. In estimating a loss allowance we consider historical experience and informed credit assessment alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues. We consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.\n\nOnce recognised, trade receivables are continuously monitored and updated. Allowances are based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged category as well as forward-looking information and general economic conditions. Allowances are calculated by individual CFUs in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that CFU.\n\nContingent assets such as any insurance recoveries, or prepaid programme rights which we expect to recoup, have not been recognised in the financial statements as these are only recognised within trade and other receivables when their receipt is virtually certain.\n\n| At 31 March             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current                 |           |           |\n| Trade receivables       | 1,339     | 1,209     |\n| Prepayments a           | 523       | 1,357     |\n| Accrued income          | 150       | 130       |\n| Deferred contract costs | 336       | 348       |\n| Other receivables       | 276       | 213       |\n|                         | 2,624     | 3,257     |\n|                         | 2022      | 2021      |\n| At 31 March             | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m        |\n| Non-current             |           |           |\n| Other assets b          | 111       | 103       |\n| Deferred contract costs | 226       | 211       |\n|                         | 337       | 314       |\n\n- a  Prepayments in FY21 included \u00a3702m relating to funds prepaid to Ofcom for the recent Spectrum auction.\n- b  Other assets comprise prepayments and leasing debtors.",

Trade and other receivables continued\n\n## Deferred contract costs\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to deferred contract costs\n\nWe capitalise certain costs associated with the acquisition and fulfilment of contracts with customers and amortise them over the period that we transfer the associated services.\n\nConnection costs are deferred as contract fulfilment costs because they allow satisfaction of the associated connection performance obligation and are considered recoverable. Sales commissions and other third party contract acquisition costs are capitalised as costs to acquire a contract unless the associated contract term is less than 12 months, in which case they are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. A portfolio approach is used to determine contract term.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contractual arrangements represent distinct performance obligations, costs in delivering these services are expensed as incurred. Where these services are not distinct performance obligations, we capitalise eligible costs as a cost of fulfilling the related service. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term, unless the pattern of service delivery indicates a more appropriate profile. To be eligible for capitalisation, costs must be directly attributable to specific contracts, relate to future activity, and generate future economic benefits. Capitalised costs are regularly assessed for recoverability.\n\nThe following table shows the movement on deferred costs:\n\n|                  | Deferred  connection  costs  \u00a3m   | Deferred  contract  acquisition  costs -   commissions  \u00a3m   | Deferred  contract  acquisition  costs - dealer  incentives  \u00a3m   | Transition and  transformation  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|\n| At 1 April 2020  | 32                                | 94                                                           | 449                                                               | 106                                  | 681         |\n| Additions        | 10                                | 76                                                           | 301                                                               | 26                                   | 413         |\n| Amortisation     | (9)                               | (68)                                                         | (391)                                                             | (19)                                 | (487)       |\n| Impairment       | (1)                               | (4)                                                          | (11)                                                              | (15)                                 | (31)        |\n| Other            | -                                 | (4)                                                          | -                                                                 | (13)                                 | (17)        |\n| At 31 March 2021 | 32                                | 94                                                           | 348                                                               | 85                                   | 559         |\n| Additions        | 17                                | 98                                                           | 291                                                               | 50                                   | 456         |\n| Amortisation     | (14)                              | (78)                                                         | (308)                                                             | (33)                                 | (433)       |\n| Impairment       | (1)                               | (5)                                                          | (10)                                                              | (11)                                 | (27)        |\n| Other            | (10)                              | 15                                                           | 3                                                                 | (1)                                  | 7           |\n| At 31 March 2022 | 24                                | 124                                                          | 324                                                               | 90                                   | 562         |\n\n## 18.

These programmes are used with a limited number of suppliers with short payment terms to extend them to a more typical payment term.\n\n## 19. Provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nOur provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, insurance claims, litigation and regulatory risks. Contingent liabilities primarily arise from litigation and regulatory matters that are not sufficiently certain to meet the criteria for recognition as provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nWe recognise provisions when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\n\nWhere these criteria are not met we disclose a contingent liability if the group has a possible obligation, or has a present obligation with an outflow that is not probable or which cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nWe exercise judgement in determining the quantum of all provisions to be recognised. Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nAs part of this assessment, we also assess the likelihood of contingent liabilities occurring in the future. Contingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet. By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes where this can be reasonably determined.\n\nIn estimating contingent liabilities we make key judgements in relation to applicable law and any historical and pending court rulings, and the likelihood, timing and cost of resolution.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates applied in accounting for contingent liabilities\n\nEstablishing contingent liabilities associated with litigation brought against the group may involve the use of critical estimates and assumptions, in particular around the ability to form a reliable estimate of any probable outflow. We provide further information in relation to specific matters in the 'contingent liabilities' section below.\n\n## Key accounting estimates applied in accounting for provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nOther provisions may involve the use of key (but not critical) estimates as explained below.\n\nProperty provisions relate to obligations arising in relation to our property portfolio, in particular costs to restore leased properties on vacation where this is required under the lease agreement. In measuring property provisions, we have made estimates of the costs association with the restoration of properties by reference to any relevant guidance such as rate cards. Cash outflows occur as and when properties are vacated and the obligations are settled.\n\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to obligations to dismantle equipment and restore network sites on vacation of the site. The provision represents the group's best estimate of the costs to dismantle equipment and restore the sites. Obligations are settled as and when sites are vacated and the timing is largely influenced by the group's network strategy.\n\nNetwork share provisions represent our future operational costs and vacant site rentals arising from obligations relating to network share agreements. Costs are expected to be incurred over a period of up to 20 years.",

Provisions & contingent liabilities continued\n\nOur regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters. The charge/credit for the year represents the outcome of management's re-assessment of the estimates and regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues. The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators. When estimating the likely value of regulatory risk we make key judgements, including in regard to interpreting Ofcom regulations and past and current claims. The precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory and compliance decisions will result in financial settlement. The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\nLitigation provisions represent the best estimate to settle present obligations recognised in respect of claims brought against the group. The estimate reflects the specific facts and circumstances of each individual matter and any relevant external advice received. Provisions recognised are inherently judgemental and could change over time as matters progress.\n\nOur insurance provision is based on our gross exposure to latent disease claims from former colleagues. A third party reviews our exposure and provides an estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nOther provisions do not include any individually material provisions.\n\nFor all risks, the ultimate liability may vary materially from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\n|                    | Property a \u00a3m   | Network  ARO a \u00a3m   | Network  share \u00a3m   | Regulatory \u00a3m   | Litigation \u00a3m   | Insurance \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2020    | 144             | 179                 | 12                  | 79              | 88              | 89             | 128        | 719        |\n| Additions          | 9               | -                   | 1                   | 32              | 17              | 7              | 50         | 116        |\n| Unwind of discount | 1               | -                   | -                   | -               | -               | -              | -          | 1          |\n| Utilised           | (7)             | (4)                 | (1)                 | (15)            | -               | (5)            | (7)        | (39)       |\n| Released           | (9)             | (17)                | -                   | -               | -               | -              | (56)       | (82)       |\n| Transfers          | -               | -                   | -                   | -               | 4               | -              | (4)        | -          |\n| At 31 March 2021   | 138             | 158                 | 12                  | 96              | 109             | 91             | 111        | 715        |\n| Additions          | 17              | 25                  | 7                   | 14              | 7               | 6              | 15         | 91         |\n| Unwind of discount | -               | 1                   | -                   | -               | -               | -              | -          | 1          |\n| Utilised           | (9)             | (3)                 | (6)                 | (26)            | -               | (5)            | (5)        | (54)       |\n| Released           | (2)             | -                   | (8)                 | (18)            | (31)            | -              | (30)       | (89)       |\n| Transfers b        | (2)             | -                   | -                   | (1)             | -               | -              | -          | (3)        |\n| 31 March 2022      | 142             | 181                 | 5                   | 65              | 85              | 92             | 91         | 661        |\n\n| At 31 March   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Analysed as:  |           |           |\n| Current       | 222       | 288       |\n| Non-current   | 439       | 427       |\n|               | 661       | 715       |\n\nIncluded within 'Other' provisions are contract loss provisions of \u00a31m (FY21: \u00a32m) relating to the anticipated total losses in respect of certain contracts.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are periodically notified of actual or threatened litigation, and regulatory and compliance matters and investigations. We provide for anticipated costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reasonable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. Provisions are reflected in the table above.\n\nWhere an outflow is not probable but is possible a contingent liability exists. Save as disclosed below, the group does not currently believe that there are any legal proceedings, or government or regulatory investigations that may have a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group. In respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group. There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and/or the often slow pace of litigation.",

Provisions & contingent liabilities continued\n\n## Class action claim\n\nIn January 2021, law firm Mishcon de Reya applied to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring a proposed class action claim for damages they estimated at \u00a3608m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a3589m (inclusive of simple interest) on behalf of our landline customers alleging anti-competitive behaviour through excessive pricing by BT to customers with certain residential landline services. Ofcom considered this topic more than four years ago. At that time, Ofcom's final statement made no finding of excessive pricing or breach of competition law more generally. The claim seeks to hold against us the fact that we implemented a voluntary commitment to reduce prices for customers that have a BT landline only and not to increase those prices beyond inflation (CPI). At the reporting date we are not aware of any evidence to indicate that a present obligation exists such that any amount should be provided for. In September 2021 the Competition Appeal Tribunal certified the claim to proceed to a substantive trial on an opt-out basis (class members are automatically included in the claim unless they choose to opt-out). We appealed the opt-out nature of that decision and in May 2022 the Court of Appeal determined that the claim should proceed on an opt-out basis. The next procedural hearing is listed on 13 May 2022. BT intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\n## Italian business\n\nMilan Public Prosecutor prosecutions: In February 2019 the Milan Public Prosecutor served BT Italia S.P.A. (BT Italia) with a notice (which named BT Italia, as well as various individuals) to record the Prosecutor's view that there is a basis for proceeding with its case against BT Italia for certain potential offences, namely the charge of having adopted, from 2011 to 2016, an inadequate management and control organisation model for the purposes of Articles 5 and 25 of Legislative Decree 231/2001.\n\nBT Italia disputes this and maintains in a defence brief filed in April 2019 that: (a) BT Italia did not gain any interest or benefit from the conduct in question; and (b) in any event, it had a sufficient organisational, management and audit model that was circumvented/ overridden by individuals acting in their own self-interest. However, following a series of committal hearings in Autumn 2020, on 10 November 2020, the Italian court agreed (as is the normal process unless there are limitation or other fundamental issues with the claim) that BT Italia, and all but one of the individuals, should be committed to a full trial.\n\nThe trial commenced on 26 January 2021 and is expected to last at least two years. On 23 April 2021, the Italian court allowed some parties to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties ('parte civile') - a procedural feature of the Italian criminal law system. These claims are directed at certain individual defendants (which include former BT/BT Italia employees). Those parties have now applied to join BT Italia as a respondent to their civil claims ('responsabile civile') on the basis that it is vicariously responsible for the individuals' wrongdoing. If successful, the quantum of those claims is not anticipated to be material.\n\n## Phones 4U\n\nSince 2015 the administrators of Phones 4U Limited have made allegations that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure Phones 4U's insolvency. Legal proceedings for an unquantified amount were issued in December 2018 by the administrators and in April 2019 we submitted our defence to this claim. The first trial, on the question of breach, is due to start on 16 May 2022, and the second trial, on quantum (if necessary), would be listed after that. We continue to dispute these allegations vigorously.\n\n## 20. Retirement benefit plans\n\n## Background to BT's pension plans\n\nThe group has both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement benefit plans. The group's main plans are in the UK and the largest by membership is the BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) which is a defined benefit plan that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2018 for over 99% of the active membership at the time. The BT Hybrid Scheme (BTHS), which combines elements of both defined benefit and defined contribution plans, was set up for non-management employees impacted by the closure of the BTPS and was closed to new entrants in 2019.\n\nNew entrants to BT in the UK are eligible to join a defined contribution plan, currently the BT Retirement Saving Scheme (BTRSS), a contract-based arrangement operated by Standard Life.\n\nEE Limited operates the EE Pension Scheme (EEPS), which has a defined benefit section that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2014 and a defined contribution section.\n\nThe group also has retirement arrangements around the world in line with local markets and culture.\n\n|                              | What are they?                                                                                                                                                                                | Future implications for BT?                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Defined  contribution  plans | Benefits in a defined contribution plan are linked to  the value of each member's fund, which is based on: \u00b7  contributions paid \u00b7  the performance of each individual's chosen  investments. | The group has no exposure to investment and other  experience risks.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Defined  benefit plans       | Benefits in a defined benefit plan are determined by  the plan rules and are: \u00b7  dependent on factors such as age, years of service  and pensionable pay \u00b7                                    | The group is exposed to investment and other experience  risks and may need to make additional contributions  where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from  regular contributions, expected investment income and  assets held. |",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to retirement benefit plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nThe net defined benefit liability, or deficit, in respect of the defined benefit plans is the present value of all expected future benefit cash flows to be paid by each plan, calculated using the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries (also known as the Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) or liabilities) less the fair value of the plan assets.\n\nThe income statement expense is allocated between an operating charge and net finance expense.\n\n- \u00b7 The operating charge reflects the increase in the liability resulting from the pension benefit earned by active employees in the current period, the cost of administering the plans and any past service costs/credits such as those arising from curtailments or settlements.\n- \u00b7 The net finance expense reflects the interest on the net defined benefit liability recognised in the group balance sheet, based on the discount rate at the start of the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability are recognised in full in the group statement of comprehensive income in the year in which they arise. These comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact on the liabilities of changes in financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the balance sheet date, and demographic assumptions, such as life expectancy, compared with those adopted at the start of the year;\n- \u00b7 The impact on the liabilities of actual experience over the year being different compared to the assumptions made at the start of the year, for example, from members choosing different benefit options at retirement or actual pension increases being different to the pension increase assumption; and\n- \u00b7 The return on plan assets being above or below the amount included in the net finance expense.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nThe operating charge for the defined contribution pension plans represents the contributions payable for the year.\n\n## Amounts in the financial statements\n\n## Group income statement\n\nThe expense arising from all group retirement benefit arrangements recognised in the group income statement is shown below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Recognised in the income statement before specific items (note 6)               |           |           |\n| - Service cost (including administration expenses and PPF levy):                |           |           |\n| - defined benefit plans                                                         | 67        | 63        |\n| - defined contribution plans                                                    | 525       | 527       |\n| - Past service cost                                                             | (1)       | 1         |\n| Subtotal                                                                        | 591       | 591       |\n| Recognised in the income statement as specific items (note 9)                   |           |           |\n| - Costs to close BTPS and provide transition payments a  for affected employees | 14        | 21        |\n| - Interest on pensions deficit                                                  | 93        | 18        |\n| Subtotal                                                                        | 107       | 39        |\n| Total recognised in the income statement                                        | 698       | 630       |\n\n## Group balance sheet\n\nThe net defined benefit liability in respect of defined benefit plans reported in the group balance sheet are set out below.\n\n|                      | 2022       | 2022            | 2022         | 2021       | 2021            | 2021         |\n|----------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| At 31 March          | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m | Deficit a \u00a3m | Assets  \u00a3m | Liabilities  \u00a3m | Deficit a \u00a3m |\n| BTPS                 | 53,465     | (54,309)        | (844)        | 53,172     | (57,737)        | (4,565)      |\n| EEPS                 | 1,004      | (1,017)         | (13)         | 934        | (1,127)         | (193)        |\n| Other plans b        | 468        | (754)           | (286)        | 506        | (844)           | (338)        |\n| Total (gross of tax) | 54,937     | (56,080)        | (1,143)      | 54,612     | (59,708)        | (5,096)      |\n| Deferred tax asset   |            |                 | 190          |            |                 | 925          |\n| Total (net of tax)   |            |                 | (953)        |            |                 | (4,171)      |",

On a CARE basis benefits are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of inflation or the individual's actual pay increase in each year to retirement.\n\nFor Section A members, benefits earned for pensionable service up to 30 June 2018 are all based upon a member's final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\nUnder the BTPS rules, increases for the majority of benefits are linked to either the Retail Price Index (RPI) or the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as summarised in the table below.\n\n| Before retirement   |                                                             | After retirement                                                                    |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sections A & B a    | Preserved benefits increase before  retirement based on CPI | Increases to benefits in payment are  currently based on CPI                        |\n| Section C           |                                                             | Increases to benefits in payment are  currently based on RPI up to a maximum  of 5% |\n\n- a  Section A members have typically elected to take Section B benefits at retirement.\n\n## How is the BTPS governed and managed?\n\nBT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited (the Trustee) has been appointed by BT as an independent trustee to administer and manage the BTPS on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the BTPS Trust Deed and Rules and relevant legislation (principally the Pensions Acts of 1993, 1995, 2004 and 2021).\n\nUnder the terms of the Trust Deed there are nine Trustee directors, all of whom are appointed by BT, as illustrated below. Trustee directors are usually appointed for a three-year term but are then eligible for re-appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChairman of the Trustee directors Appointed by BT after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions.\n\nMember nominated Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT based on nominations by trade unions.\n\n## Employer nominated Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT. Two normally hold senior positions within the group and two normally hold (or have held) senior positions in commerce or industry.\n\n## BTPS IAS 19 assets\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made when valuing our pension assets\n\nUnder IAS 19, plan assets should be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe pension assets include quoted and unquoted investments. A portion of unquoted investments are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable, which require more judgement. The assumptions used in valuing unquoted investments are affected by market conditions.\n\nAround \u00a35.6bn of these unquoted investments are formally valued periodically by the investment manager and the latest valuation precedes the balance sheet date. These valuations have been adjusted for cash movements between the previous valuation date and 31 March 2022. The valuation approach and inputs for these investments would only be approximately updated where there were indications of significant market movements, which was not the case at 31 March 2022 or in 2021. The BTPS exposure to Russian assets is less than 0.1% of the BTPS assets.\n\nThe asset-backed funding arrangement, issued to the BTPS in May 2021, which has a fair value of \u00a31.4bn at 31 March 2022, is not recognised as a pension asset when measuring the group's IAS 19 net defined benefit liability as it is a non-transferable financial instrument issued by the reporting entity.\n\nValuation of main quoted investments\n\n- \u00b7 Equities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices.\n- \u00b7 Bonds that are regularly traded are valued using broker quotes.\n- \u00b7 Exchange traded derivative contracts are valued based on closing bid prices.",

        "page_content": "## 20. Retirement benefit plans continued\n\nValuation of main unquoted investments\n\n- \u00b7 Equities are valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEVC) guidelines where the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and earnings assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer using RICS guidelines. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates.\n- \u00b7 Bonds, including those issued by BT, that are not regularly traded are valued by an independent valuer using pricing models making assumptions for credit risk, market risk and market yield curves.\n- \u00b7 Over the counter derivatives are valued by an independent valuer using cash flows discounted at market rates. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are the yield curves and cost of carry.\n- \u00b7 Holdings in investment funds are typically valued at the Net Asset Value provided by the fund administrator or investment manager. The significant assumption used in the valuation is the Net Asset Value.\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure investments are valued by an independent valuer using a model-based valuation such as a discounted cash flow approach, or at the price of recent market transactions if they represent fair value. Where a discounted cash flow model is used, the significant assumptions used in the valuation are the discount rate and the expected cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The value of the longevity insurance contract held by the BTPS is measured by discounting the projected cash flows payable under the contract (projected by an actuary, consistent with the terms of the contract). The significant assumptions used to value the asset are the discount rate (including adjustments to the risk free rate) and the mortality assumptions.\n\n## How are the BTPS assets invested?\n\nThe Trustee regularly reviews the allocation of assets between different investment classes, taking into account current market conditions and trends. The allocations reflect the Trustee's views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be allocated to match liabilities.\n\nThe table below shows the fair value of the BTPS assets analysed by asset category, subdivided by valuations based on a quoted market price in an active market, and those that are not (such as investment funds).\n\n|                                |                       | 2022 a              | 2022 a                 | 2022 a   | 2021 a             | 2021 a                 | 2021 a   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------|--------------------|------------------------|----------|\n| At 31 March                    |                       | Total   assets  \u00a3bn | of which  quoted b \u00a3bn | Total  % | Total  assets  \u00a3bn | of which  quoted b \u00a3bn | Total  % |\n| Growth                         |                       |                     |                        |          |                    |                        |          |\n| Equities                       | UK                    | 0.3                 | 0.2                    | 1        | 0.3                | 0.3                    | 1        |\n|                                | Overseas developed    | 6.5                 | 5.6                    | 12       | 7.0                | 6.5                    | 13       |\n|                                | Emerging markets      | 1.0                 | 0.9                    | 2        | 1.3                | 1.3                    | 2        |\n| Private Equity                 |                       | 1.2                 | -                      | 2        | 1.6                | -                      | 3        |\n| Property                       | UK                    | 3.4                 | -                      | 6        | 2.9                | -                      | 5        |\n|                                | Overseas              | 0.8                 | -                      | 2        | 0.8                | -                      | 2        |\n| Other growth assets            | Absolute Return c     | 1.0                 | -                      | 2        | 1.1                | -                      | 2        |\n|                                | Non Core Credit d     | 4.7                 | 1.4                    | 9        | 4.3                | 1.4                    | 8        |\n|                                | Mature Infrastructure | 1.4                 | -                      | 3        | 1.3                | -                      | 2        |\n| Liability matching             |                       |                     |                        |          |                    |                        |          |\n| Government bonds               | UK                    | 15.1                | 15.1                   | 28       | 14.3               | 14.3                   | 27       |\n| Investment grade credit        | Global                | 13.9                | 11.7                   | 26       | 14.1               | 11.5                   | 27       |\n| Secure income assets e         |                       | 2.6                 | -                      | 5        | 2.1                | -                      | 4        |\n| Cash, derivatives and other    |                       |                     |                        |          |                    |                        |          |\n| Cash balances                  |                       | 2.9                 | -                      | 5        | 1.4                | -                      | 3        |\n| Longevity insurance contract f |                       | (1.0)               | -                      | (2)      | (0.8)              | -                      | (2)      |\n| Other g                        |                       | (0.3)               | -                      | (1)      | 1.5                | -                      | 3        |\n| Total                          |                       | 53.5                | 34.9                   | 100      | 53.2               | 35.3                   | 100      |\n\n- a  At 31 March 2022, the BTPS did not hold any equity issued by the group (FY21: nil).

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## BTPS IAS 19 Liabilities\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made when valuing our pension liabilities\n\nThe measurement of the service cost and the liabilities involves judgement about uncertain events including the life expectancy of members, price inflation and the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of the future pension payments. We use estimates for all of these uncertain events. Our assumptions reflect historical experience, actuarial advice and our judgement regarding future expectations at the balance sheet date.\n\n## What are the forecast benefits payable from the BTPS?\n\nThere were 274,000 members in the BTPS at 30 June 2021, the date of the membership data used to value the IAS 19 liabilities. Members belong to one of three sections depending upon the date they first joined the BTPS, which impacts the benefits they are expected to receive.\n\nBenefits to members from the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 60 years. Projecting future expected benefit payments requires a number of assumptions, including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and is therefore inherently uncertain. Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement than assumed. The liabilities are the present value of the future expected benefit payments.\n\nThe chart below illustrates the estimated benefits payable from the BTPS, and projected liabilities, forecast using the IAS 19 assumptions. Whilst benefit payments are expected to increase over the earlier years, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.\n\n## Forecast benefits payable by BTPS at 31 March 2022 (unaudited)\n\n)\n\nn\n\nb\n\n\u00a3\n\ns (\n\ne\n\ni\n\nt\n\ni\n\nl\n\ni\n\nb\n\na\n\ni\n\n9 l\n\nS 1\n\nA\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nForecast benefit payments (left axis)\n\nIAS 19 liabilities (right axis)\n\nThe estimated duration of the BTPS liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 14 years using the IAS 19 assumptions.\n\n## What is the breakdown of the membership and IAS 19 liabilities?\n\n|                                    | Active  members   |   Deferred  members |   Pensioners |   Total |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|---------|\n| Sections A and B liabilities (\u00a3bn) | -                 |                 5.5 |         30.7 |    36.2 |\n| Section C liabilities (\u00a3bn)        | -                 |                12.4 |          5.7 |    18.1 |\n| Total IAS 19 liabilities (\u00a3bn)     | -                 |                17.9 |         36.4 |    54.3 |\n| Total number of members (000's)    | -                 |                67   |        207   |   274   |\n\n## What are the key assumptions and how have they been set?\n\nThe key financial assumptions used to measure the IAS 19 liabilities of the BTPS, where the nominal rates have been rounded to the nearest 0.05%, are shown below.\n\n|                                     | Nominal rates (per year)   | Nominal rates (per year)   | Real rates (per year) a   | Real rates (per year) a   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| At 31 March                         | 2022                       | 2021                       | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Discount rate                       | 2.75%                      | 2.05%                      | (0.92)%                   | (1.11)%                   |\n| Inflation - average increase in RPI | 3.70%                      | 3.20%                      | -                         | -                         |\n| Inflation - average increase in CPI | 3.25%                      | 2.75%                      | (0.43)%                   | (0.44)%                   |\n\n- a  The real rate is calculated relative to RPI inflation.",

The purpose of the funding valuation is for BT and the Trustee to agree cash contributions from BT to the BTPS to ensure the BTPS has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments to members. It is prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation, such as the 2004 Pensions Act, and uses a prudent approach overall.\n\nThis differs from the IAS 19 valuation, which is used for deriving the balance sheet and P&L figures in the Group accounts with principles being set out in the IFRS standards, and uses a best-estimate approach overall (with the exception of the discount rate, which IAS 19 requires to be based on the yields on high quality corporate bonds regardless of the investment held by the BTPS).\n\nThe different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and deficit.\n\nThe latest funding valuation was performed as at 30 June 2020. The next funding valuation will have an effective date of no later than 30 June 2023.",

The discount rate reflects the investment strategy over time, allowing for the BTPS to de-risk to a portfolio consisting predominantly of bond and bond-like investments by 2034. It has been set consistently with the 2017 valuation, mechanically updated to reflect the move in swap pricing from LIBOR to SONIA, leading to a prudent discount rate of 1.4% per year above the risk-free yield curve in 2020, trending down to 0.8% per year above the risk-free yield curve from 2035. The assumption was equivalent to using a flat discount rate of 0.9% per year above the risk-free yield curve at 30 June 2020.\n\nThe average life expectancy assumptions at the funding valuation dates, for members 60 years of age, are as follows.\n\n| Number of years from valuation date                                                  |   June 2020  assumptions | June 2017  assumptions   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Male in lower pension bracket                                                        |                     25.8 | 25.9 to 27.2             |\n| Male in higher pension bracket                                                       |                     28   | 28.6                     |\n| Female                                                                               |                     28.5 | 28.6 to 28.9             |\n| Average additional life expectancy for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years' time |                      0.9 | 0.9                      |\n\n## Changes in the funding position (unaudited)\n\nThe Scheme Actuary has carried out an interim assessment as at 30 June 2021, estimating the BTPS's funding position to have improved from a funding deficit of \u00a38.0bn to \u00a34.1bn. BT and the Trustee will agree cash contributions in the usual way at the next full triennial funding valuation, scheduled to take place as at 30 June 2023.\n\nChanges in market conditions can have a different impact on the funding liabilities and the IAS 19 liabilities. For example, the funding liabilities use a discount rate linked to a risk-free rate, whereas the IAS 19 liabilities use a discount rate based on corporate bond yields (and so are affected by changes in credit spreads). The estimated impact of the scenarios illustrated on page 175 on the 30 June 2021 interim assessment of the funding position are shown in the table below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease/(decrease) in liabilities\n\nIncrease/(decrease) in assets",

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Future funding obligations and deficit repair plan\n\nUnder the terms of the Trust Deed, the group is required to have a funding plan, determined at the conclusion of the triennial funding valuation, which is a legal agreement between BT and the Trustee and should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.\n\nIn May 2021, the 2020 triennial funding valuation was finalised, agreed with the Trustee and certified by the Scheme Actuary. The funding deficit at 30 June 2020 was \u00a38.0bn. The funding deficit was agreed to be met as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00a32bn met through an Asset Backed Funding arrangement (ABF) which is structured as a Scottish Limited Partnership (SLP) with BT and BTPS as limited partners, and BT Corporate Limited as general partner. The underlying asset is a loan note issued by EE Group Investments Limited, with an initial face value of \u00a31.9bn. The BTPS has an entitlement to the full value of the loan note in the event of an insolvency of BT.\n\nThe loan note had a term of approximately 13 years. On or before 30 June each year (with a final payment in June 2033), the ABF will distribute capital and interest amounting to \u00a3180m to the BTPS, provided that the BTPS was in deficit on a funding basis as at 30 June of the preceding year. If the BTPS reaches full funding at any 30 June, the payments to the BTPS will cease. The stream of payments are financed through distributions from EE Limited and shares in EE Limited provide security over the payment stream. No impact is expected on the day-to-day operations of BT or EE as a result. The fair value of the BTPS investment in the ABF at the date of investment was \u00a31.66bn, with BT receiving tax relief on that amount spread over four years. This is calculated as the net present value of the annual capital and interest payments, and is less than the face value of the underlying loan note reflecting the probability of the BTPS becoming fully funded, and therefore the annual capital and interest payments to the BTPS ending before the underlying loan note matures. Following receipt of the first \u00a3180m capital and interest payment, the fair value of the BTPS investment in the ABF as at 31 March 2022 was \u00a31.4bn.\n\nThe ABF has no impact on the gross IAS 19 deficit in the BT Group plc consolidated accounts initially, but has reduced the deferred tax asset recognised, as some tax relief has been received up-front. Annual capital and interest payments will reduce the IAS 19 net defined benefit liability.\n\n- \u00b7 Cash contributions over the 10 years to 30 June 2030.\n\n## Co-investment vehicle\n\nBT and the Trustee agreed a co-investment vehicle at the 30 June 2020 valuation which provides BT with some protection against the risk of overfunding by allowing money to be returned to BT if not needed by the BTPS, enabling BT to provide upfront funding with greater confidence.\n\nBT has the option to pay deficit repair plan payments after 30 June 2023 into the co-investment vehicle (which is a SLP separate to the SLP used for the ABF), which will be invested as if part of the overall BTPS investment strategy. The value of the assets held in the vehicle are included in the assets of the BTPS for the purposes of calculating both the funding deficit and the IAS 19 net defined benefit liability.\n\nTo the extent there is a funding deficit at 30 June 2034, the co-investment vehicle will pay funds to the BTPS. BT will receive tax relief on funds paid at this point, rather than in the year when funds are paid from BT into the vehicle.\n\nAny remaining funds in the co-investment vehicle will then be returned to BT in three annual payments in 2035, 2036 and 2037, unless the BTPS has subsequently moved into funding deficit or the Trustee, acting prudently but reasonably, decides to defer or reduce these payments.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, there were less than \u00a31m of assets in the co-investment vehicle.\n\n## Future funding commitment\n\nAt the 2020 valuation, BT agreed additional contributions will be automatically payable in the event the deficit repair plan is no longer sufficient to meet the funding deficit.\n\nShould an annual update of the funding position reveal that the BTPS has fallen more than \u00a31bn behind plan, BT will commence additional payments of between \u00a3150m to \u00a3200m per year. The payments will stop once the funding deficit at a future annual update has improved such that the remaining deficit repair plan is sufficient to meet the funding deficit. Payments can switch-on again if the funding deficit position subsequently deteriorates.\n\nThe first annual test was carried out as at 30 June 2021. This showed that the deficit repair plan was still sufficient to meet the funding deficit, and hence no additional contributions were required. The next annual test will be carried out as at 30 June 2022.\n\nAny additional contributions under this agreement cease by 30 June 2034.",

When shares held for the beneficial ownership of employees vest unconditionally or are cancelled they are transferred from the own shares reserve to retained earnings at their weighted average cost.\n\n|                           | Treasury shares a   | Treasury shares a   | Employee share  ownership trust a   | Employee share  ownership trust a   | Total    | Total   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                           | millions            | \u00a3m                  | millions                            | \u00a3m                                  | millions | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 April 2020           | 86                  | (223)               | 7                                   | (14)                                | 93       | (237)   |\n| Own shares purchased b    | -                   | -                   | 11                                  | (14)                                | 11       | (14)    |\n| Yourshare issue           | (35)                | 90                  | -                                   | -                                   | (35)     | 90      |\n| Share options exercised b | -                   | 1                   | -                                   | -                                   | -        | 1       |\n| Share awards vested       | -                   | -                   | (9)                                 | 17                                  | (9)      | 17      |\n| At 31 March 2021          | 51                  | (132)               | 9                                   | (11)                                | 60       | (143)   |\n| Own shares purchased b    | -                   | -                   | 114                                 | (210)                               | 114      | (210)   |\n| Yourshare issue           | (1)                 | 2                   | (18)                                | 34                                  | (19)     | 36      |\n| Share options exercised b | (9)                 | 22                  | -                                   | -                                   | (9)      | 22      |\n| Share awards vested       | -                   | -                   | (11)                                | 21                                  | (11)     | 21      |\n| At 31 March 2022          | 41                  | (108)               | 94                                  | (166)                               | 135      | (274)   |",

Own shares continued\n\nThe treasury shares reserve represents BT Group plc shares purchased directly by the group. The BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) also purchases BT Group plc shares.\n\nThe treasury shares and the shares in the Trust are being used to satisfy our obligations under employee share plans, further details of which are provided in note 22.\n\n## 22. Share-based payments\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to share-based payments\n\nWe operate a number of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which we receive services from employees in consideration for equity instruments (share options and shares) of the group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Market-based performance criteria and non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to make contributions to the share purchase programme) are reflected in this measurement of fair value. The fair value determined at the grant date is recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the group's estimate of the options or shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using either the Binomial options pricing model or Monte Carlo simulations, whichever is more appropriate to the share-based payment arrangement.\n\nService and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions which have to be taken into account to determine the fair value of equity instruments granted. In the case that an award or option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of either counterparty, this is accounted for as a cancellation. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised in the income statement. As the requirement to save under an employee saveshare arrangement is a non-vesting condition, employee cancellations, other than through a termination of service, are treated as an accelerated vesting.\n\nNo adjustment is made to total equity for awards that lapse or are forfeited after the vesting date.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee saveshare plans                   | 29        | 38        |\n| Yourshare                                  | 28        | 18        |\n| Executive share plans:                     |           |           |\n| Incentive Share Plan (ISP)                 | 14        | (8)       |\n| Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)                  | 11        | 10        |\n| Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP) | 26        | 14        |\n|                                            | 108       | 72        |\n\n## What share incentive arrangements do we have?\n\nOur plans include savings-related share option plans for employees and those of participating subsidiaries and several share plans for executives. All share-based payment plans are equity-settled. Details of these plans are set out below.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nUnder an HMRC-approved savings-related share option plan, employees save on a monthly basis, over a three or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted. This price is set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans. The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Similar plans operate for our overseas employees. The scheme did not operate in FY22.\n\n## Incentive Share Plan (ISP)\n\nParticipants are entitled to shares under the ISP in full at the end of a three-year period only if the group has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group. The last ISP award was granted in 2019. For this award, 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return (TSR) target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period; 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative normalised free cash flow measure; and 20% to growth in underlying revenue.\n\nThe cash flow and revenue targets under the 2019 ISP were adjusted in FY22 to reflect acquisitions and divestments during the three-year period to ensure performance is being measured on a like-for-like basis. This resulted in a charge of \u00a314m for the year (FY21: credit of \u00a38m).\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)\n\nAwards are granted annually to selected employees. Shares in the group are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.\n\n## Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP)\n\nAwards are granted to selected employees. Shares in the group are transferred to participants at the end of a specified retention or restricted period if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.",

The shares will be held in trust for a 3 year vesting period after which they will be transferred to employees, providing they have been continuously employed during that time. A similar plan operates for overseas employees.\n\nUnder the terms of Yourshare and the executive share plans, dividends are reinvested in shares that are added to the relevant share awards.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nMovements in Employee Saveshare options are shown below.\n\n|                         | Number of   share options   | Number of   share options   | Weighted average  exercise price   | Weighted average  exercise price   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 March     | 2022 millions               | 2021 millions               | 2022 pence                         | 2021 pence                         |\n| Outstanding at 1 April  | 414                         | 214                         | 121                                | 202                                |\n| Granted                 | -

There were no grants under Employee Saveshare in FY22.\n\n| Year ended 31 March 2021                   | Employee  Saveshare   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Weighted average fair value                | 23p                   |\n| Weighted average share price               | 114p                  |\n| Weighted average exercise price of options | 85p                   |\n| Expected dividend yield                    | 5.19% - 6.49%         |\n| Risk free rates                            | -0.001% - 0.11%       |\n| Expected volatility                        | 28.33% - 28.39%       |\n\nEmployee Saveshare grants are valued using a Binomial options pricing model. Awards under the ISP were valued using Monte Carlo simulations. TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each company's volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks. There were no ISP awards granted in FY21 or FY22.\n\nVolatility has been determined by reference to BT's historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future. An expected life of six months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options. For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.\n\nThe fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date. The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in FY22 was 203p (FY21: 117p) and for RSP awards granted in FY22 was 201p (FY21: 103p).\n\n## 23. Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nWe classify non-current assets or a group of assets and associated liabilities, together forming a disposal group, as 'held for sale' when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through disposal rather than continuing use and the sale is highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed divestment within one year from the date of classification. We measure non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\nUpon completion of a divestment, we recognise a profit or loss on disposal calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest less costs incurred in disposing of the asset or disposal group and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or disposal group (including goodwill). The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item, see note 9.\n\nIn the event that non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale form a separate and identifiable major line of business, the results for both the current and comparative periods are reclassified as 'discontinued operations'.\n\n## Divestments\n\nDuring the year we completed the disposals of Diamond IP, a non-core software business in America, and certain business units in Italy serving customers in the public administration and SME sectors, recording a combined net gain of \u00a335m.\n\nIn FY21 we recorded a net gain of \u00a380m on disposal of our domestic operations in Spain, a combined net loss of \u00a311m on the disposals of our domestic operations in France and Latin America, and a net loss of \u00a34m relating to the disposal of a number of other businesses.\n\nThe divestment of these operations is in line with our long-term strategy. The disposals in the current or prior year have not been reclassified as discontinued operations as they do not meet our definition of a separate major line of business.",

No other disposal groups were classified as held for sale during FY21 or FY22.\n\n## BT Sport\n\nIn May 2022 we reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery (Discovery) to create a sports joint venture (JV) combining BT Sport and Discovery's Eurosport UK business into a separate legal entity with both BT and Discovery each holding a 50% interest and equal voting rights. The production and operational assets of BT Sport will transfer to, and become a wholly owned subsidiary of, Discovery who will manage and operate the production of the sport content.\n\nDiscovery will have the option to acquire BT's 50% interest in the JV at specified points during the first four years of the JV. The price payable under the Call Option will be 50% of the JV, at a price to be determined at the time, plus any unpaid fixed consideration and remaining earn-out as described below. If the Call Option is not exercised, BT will have the ability to exit its shareholding in the JV either through a sale or IPO.\n\nAt completion of the transaction, BT is expected to lose control of the BT Sport operations and the group's interest in the combined business is expected to be classified as a Joint Venture under IFRS 11 based on the assessment of ownership and joint control over the key decisions of the JV (50/50 with Discovery) established through the joint venture agreement. BT will enter into a distribution agreement with the JV to procure the sport content required to continue to supply our existing broadband, TV and mobile customers. BT's agreement with the JV will extend beyond 2030 and for the first four years includes a minimum revenue guarantee of approximately \u00a3500m per annum, after which the agreement will change to a fully variable arrangement.\n\nBT Sport's distribution agreement with Virgin Media will transfer into the JV, and the JV will also enter into a new agreement with Sky extending beyond 2030 to provide for its distribution of the JV's combined sports content. BT will also enter into a distribution agreement with Discovery to provide discovery+, the non-fiction entertainment streaming service to its direct BT TV and BT Sport customers.\n\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approval, but it is expected to conclude by the end of 2022 and meets the held for sale criteria per IFRS 5. Accordingly, the asset and liabilities of the BT Sport disposal group have been classified as held for sale at 31 March 2022.\n\nThe assets of the disposal group have been tested for impairment under existing relevant standards immediately prior to classification as held for sale with no impairment recognised.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 23. Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\nAs the estimated fair value from the joint venture transaction, net of any costs incurred or liabilities recognised, is higher than the carrying value of the disposal group, no impairment has been recognised subsequent to classification as held for sale. We used the discounted cash flows due to BT from fixed consideration of \u00a393m payable in four instalments over the next three years and variable consideration whereby BT will be issued with redeemable preferred shares in the JV which will entitle BT to receive an earn out from the JV of up to approximately \u00a3540m over the first four years post completion subject to certain conditions being met, plus a potential exit value from the sale of the group's 50% interest, as total gross consideration. BT's obligation under the minimum revenue guarantee in the distribution agreement has been treated as a reduction to the fair value of the consideration in the impairment test. The inputs into the fair value calculation are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy and supported by internal valuation models over which we have applied sensitivities on the future cash flows from the JV and the trading multiples for the exit valuation.\n\nBT Sport has not been reclassified as a discontinued operation as it does not meet our definition of a separate major line of business.\n\nThe BT Sport disposal group comprises the following assets and liabilities:\n\n| At 31 March                   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|\n| Assets                        |           |\n| Intangible assets a           | 55        |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 13        |\n| Right-of-use assets           | 2         |\n| Trade and other receivables   | 10        |\n| Assets held for sale b        | 80        |\n| Liabilities                   |           |\n| Trade and other payables      | 38        |\n| Lease liabilities             | 2         |\n| Liabilities held for sale     | 40        |\n\n- a  Intangible assets includes goodwill of \u00a351m that has been allocated to the disposal group on a relative value approach as per IAS 36.\n- b  \u00a3310m of programme rights relating to sports broadcasting rights acquired for the BT Sport operations have not been reclassified to held for sale as the carrying amount of these assets is expected to be recovered principally through continuing use before completion of the transaction.\n\n## 24.

All gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the income statement when the investments are disposed of, aside from dividends which are recognised in the income statement when our right to receive payment is established.

Loans and other borrowings\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to loans and other borrowings\n\nWe initially recognise loans and other borrowings at the fair value of amounts received net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and, if included in a fair value hedge relationship, are re-valued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. The resulting amortisation of fair value movements, on de-designation of the hedge, is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## What's our capital management policy?\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and meeting our distribution policy. In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders. We manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it accordingly to reflect changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group. The Board regularly reviews the capital structure. No changes were made to these objectives and processes during FY22. For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.\n\nOur capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders' equity. The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.\n\n| At 31 March                         | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net debt                            | 18,009    | 17,802    |\n| Total parent shareholders' equity a | 15,274    | 11,650    |\n| Capital structure                   | 33,283    | 29,452    |\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on balance sheet.\n\nOur net debt calculation starts from the expected undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to loans and other borrowings, current asset investments and cash equivalents to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Net financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (current and non-current), current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents. A reconciliation from these IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt is given below.\n\n| At 31 March                                                                                             | Notes   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans and other borrowings a                                                                            |         | 16,185    | 16,685    |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                       | 15      | 5,760     | 6,152     |\n| Net liabilities classified as held for sale b                                                           | 23      | 2         | -         |\n| Less:                                                                                                   |         |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                                               | 25      | (777)     | (1,000)   |\n| Current asset investments                                                                               | 24      | (2,679)   | (3,652)   |\n|                                                                                                         |         | 18,491    | 18,185    |\n| Adjustments:                                                                                            |         |           |           |\n| To retranslate debt balances at swap rates where hedged by currency swaps c                             |         | (234)     | (142)     |\n| To remove accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method and fair value  adjustments |         | (248)     | (241)     |\n| Net debt                                                                                                |         | 18,009    | 17,802    |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                                       |         | (5,760)   | (6,152)   |\n| Lease liabilities classified as held for sale b                                                         |         | (2)       | -         |\n| Net financial debt                                                                                      |         | 12,247    | 11,650    |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 28. Financial instruments and risk management\n\nWe issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations; to finance corporate transactions such as share buybacks and acquisitions; for the temporary investment of short-term funds; and to manage currency and interest rate risks. In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.\n\n## How do we manage financial risk?\n\nOur activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Treasury operation\n\nWe have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated market risks, and credit risk.\n\n## Treasury policy\n\nTreasury policy is set by the Board. Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures. The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations. Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the chairman, the chief executive or the chief financial officer.\n\nThere has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31 March 2022 and the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\n## How do we manage interest rate risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings. Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.\n\nOur policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of on-going net debt is at fixed rates. Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the chief financial officer, the director tax, treasury, insurance and pensions or the group treasury director who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn order to manage our interest rate profile, we enter into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed. The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments. The majority of the group's long-term borrowings are subject to fixed sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark reform\n\nThe UK Financial Conduct Authority announced on 5 March 2021 that as part of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, LIBOR will start being discontinued as a benchmark rate from 31 December 2021. The group has no floating rate debt securities. It has 5 US dollar cross-currency interest rate swaps and 21 sterling interest rate swaps impacted by the IBOR reform maturing between 2028 and 2030. The net exposure of these swaps is nil. The group has adhered to the International Swaps And Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fall backs Protocol, however, BT has varied some terms on a bilateral basis to apply five-day lookback without observational shift. The impact of any resulting ineffectiveness arising from the discontinuation of LIBOR will be immaterial to the group and will not adversely affect the group's ability to manage interest rate risk.\n\n## How do we manage foreign exchange risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nForeign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.\n\nThe Board's policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.\n\nThe Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the chief financial officer, the director tax, treasury, insurance and pensions or the group treasury director.",

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nA significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in sterling. Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.\n\nWe enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments. The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US dollar, euro and Indian rupees. As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.\n\nWe use cross-currency swaps to swap foreign currency borrowings into sterling. The table below reflects the currency and interest rate profile of our loans and borrowings after the impact of hedging.\n\n|                                                           | 2022                    | 2022                        | 2022     | 2021                    | 2021                        | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|\n| At 31 March                                               | Fixed rate  interest \u00a3m | Floating  rate  interest \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Fixed rate  interest \u00a3m | Floating  rate  interest \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Sterling                                                  | 13,515                  | 1,746                       | 15,261   | 14,129                  | 1,688                       | 15,817   |\n| Euro                                                      | -                       | 436                         | 436      | -                       | 464                         | 464      |\n| Other                                                     | -                       | 3                           | 3        | -                       | 20                          | 20       |\n| Total                                                     | 13,515                  | 2,185                       | 15,700   | 14,129                  | 2,172                       | 16,301   |\n| Ratio of fixed to floating                                | 86%                     | 14%                         | 100%     | 87%                     | 13%                         | 100%     |\n| Weighted average effective fixed interest rate - sterling | 3.9%                    |                             |          | 3.8%                    |                             |          |\n\nThe floating rate loans and borrowings and committed facilities bear interest rates fixed in advance for periods up to one year, primarily by reference to RPI, CPI and LIBOR which have transitioned onto ARRs where applicable.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe income statement and shareholders' equity are exposed to volatility arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To demonstrate this volatility, management has concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 For interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across sterling, US dollar and euro currencies.\n- \u00b7 For foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies.\n\nThe impact on equity, before tax and excluding any impact related to retirement benefit plans, of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies is as detailed below:\n\n| At 31 March              | 2022 \u00a3m  Increase  (reduce)   | 2021 \u00a3m  Increase  (reduce)   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Sterling interest rates  | 666                           | 816                           |\n| US dollar interest rates | (429)                         | (438)                         |\n| Euro interest rates      | (247)                         | (349)                         |\n| Sterling strengthening   | (203)                         | (255)                         |\n\nA 1% decrease in interest rates and 10% weakening of sterling against other currencies would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\nThe impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the group's annual net finance expense and our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, (excluding translation exposures) would not have been material in FY22 and FY21.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nWe continue to target a BBB+/Baa1 credit rating over the cycle, with a BBB floor. We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements. These include the pension deficit and shareholder distributions.\n\nOur December 2030 bond contains terms that require us to pay higher rates of interest when our credit ratings are below A3 in the case of Moody's or A- in the case of Standard & Poor's (S&P). Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade. Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of \u00a32bn at 31 March 2022, our finance expense would increase/decrease by approximately \u00a310m a year if the group's credit rating were to be downgraded/upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.",

These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period. On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters. We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise. The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2022 is disclosed in note 26. We have no term debt maturities in FY23.\n\nOur treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by the Board. We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2022 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn (FY21: \u00a32.1bn) maturing in March 2027.\n\nIn the UK, the group has arranged for funders to offer a supplier financing scheme to the group's suppliers. This enables suppliers who sign up to the arrangements to sell their invoices to the funders and to be paid earlier than the invoice due date. The group assesses the arrangement against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing scheme continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings. At 31 March 2022 the payables met the criteria of trade payables.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark reform\n\nThe group's syndicated Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn at 31st March 2022), previously referring to IBOR rates, has been updated to reference alternative benchmark rates for sterling (Sonia) and US dollars (SOFR). Notional cash pooling arrangements and overdraft arrangements have transitioned onto ARRs where applicable. Any outstanding group contracts with reference to LIBOR benchmarks include provisions for calculation of interest based on alternative benchmark rates.\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of the remaining cash flows including interest payable for our non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which may therefore differ from both the carrying value and fair value.\n\nInterest\n\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities At 31 March 2022   | Loans   and other  borrowings \u00a3m   | on loans  and other  borrowings \u00a3m   | Trade   and other  payables \u00a3m   | Provisions \u00a3m   | Lease  liabilities \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                                     | 640                                | 568                                  | 5,224                            | 4               | 788                     | 7,224      |\n| Between one and two years                               | 935                                | 564                                  | -                                | 4               | 784                     | 2,287      |\n| Between two and three years                             | 1,415                              | 538                                  | -                                | 3               | 729                     | 2,685      |\n| Between three and four years                            | 2,532                              | 515                                  | -                                | -               | 626                     | 3,673      |\n| Between four and five years                             | 379                                | 477                                  | -                                | -               | 589                     | 1,445      |\n| After five years                                        | 10,041                             | 2,809                                | -                                | -               | 2,983                   | 15,833     |\n|                                                         | 15,942                             | 5,471                                | 5,224                            | 11              | 6,499                   | 33,147     |\n| Interest payments not yet accrued                       | -                                  | (5,238)                              | -                                | -               | -                       | (5,238)    |\n| Fair value adjustment                                   | 10                                 | -                                    | -                                | -               | -                       | 10         |\n| Impact of discounting                                   | -                                  | -                                    | -                                | -               | (739)                   | (739)      |\n| Carrying value on the balance sheet a,b                 | 15,952                             | 233                                  | 5,224                            | 11              | 5,760                   | 27,180     |",

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## How do we manage credit risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nOur exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation (primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents) and from trading-related receivables.\n\nFor treasury-related balances, the Board's defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3/A- for long-term and P1/A1 for short-term investments. If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.\n\nThe treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.\n\n## Operational management policy\n\nOur credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the customer-facing units (CFUs) to ensure compliance. The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards. Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit. We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure of the group's financial assets at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n| At 31 March                   | Notes   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n| Derivative financial assets   |         | 1,091     | 1,235     |\n| Investments                   | 24      | 2,713     | 3,683     |\n| Trade and other receivables a | 17      | 1,489     | 1,339     |\n| Contract assets               | 5       | 1,915     | 1,859     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 25      | 777       | 1,000     |\n| Total                         |         | 7,985     | 9,116     |\n\nThe credit quality and credit concentration of cash equivalents, current asset investments and derivative financial assets are detailed in the tables below.

Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional \u00a32,024m of long dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.",

Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they meet the criteria for designation as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAll of our derivative financial instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge\n\nThe group designates certain derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, hedge documentation must be prepared at inception, the hedge must be in line with BT's risk management strategy and there must be an economic relationship based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows of the hedging instrument and hedged item. This is assessed at inception and in subsequent periods in which the hedge remains in operation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer in line with BT's risk management strategy or if it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nThe group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is assessed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of altered timing, cash flows or value.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. For cash flow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the same line of the income statement and in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Other derivatives\n\nOur policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes. However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or may be specifically not designated as a hedge because natural offset is more appropriate. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are recognised at fair value. Any direct transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the income statement in the line that most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction to which they relate.\n\nWhere the fair value of a derivative contract at initial recognition is not supported by observable market data and differs from the transaction price, a day one gain or loss will arise which is not recognised in the income statement. Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the income statement based on the remaining contractual term and as observable market data becomes available.\n\nThe fair values of outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.",

Forward currency contracts are taken out to hedge step-up interest on currency denominated borrowings relating to the group's 2030 US dollar bond. The hedged cash flows will affect the group's income statement as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the borrowings (see note 26).\n\nWe hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, principally denominated in US dollar, euro and Indian rupees 12 months forward with certain specific transactions hedged further forward. The related cash flows are recognised in the income statement over this period.\n\nThe amounts related to items designated as hedging instruments were as follows:\n\n| Hedged items At 31 March 2022                          | Notional  principal \u00a3m   | Asset \u00a3m   | Liability \u00a3m   | Balance in  cash flow  hedge related  reserves  (gain)/loss \u00a3m   | Fair value  (gain)/loss  recognised  in OCI \u00a3m   | Amount  recycled from  cash flow  hedge related  reserves  to P&L \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sterling, euro and US dollar denominated  borrowings a |                          |            |                |                                                                  |                                                  |                                                                        |\n|                                                        | 11,688                   | 889        | (731)          | (26)                                                             | (83)                                             | 61                                                                     |\n| Step up interest on the 2030 US dollar bond b          | 122                      | 5          | -              | (29)                                                             | (6)                                              | 3                                                                      |\n| Foreign currency purchases, principally                |                          |            |                |                                                                  |                                                  |                                                                        |\n| denominated in US dollar, euro and Indian rupees c     | 946                      | 30         | (3)            | (21)                                                             | (51)                                             | (10)                                                                   |\n| Energy contracts d                                     |                          | 31         | (3)            | (28)                                                             | (64)                                             | -                                                                      |\n| Total cash flow hedges                                 | 12,756                   | 955        | (737)          | (104)                                                            | (204)                                            | 54                                                                     |\n| Deferred tax                                           |                          | -          | -              | 16                                                               |                                                  |                                                                        |\n| Derivatives not in a designated hedge  relationship    |                          | 136        | (133)          | -                                                                |                                                  |                                                                        |\n| Carrying value on the balance sheet                    |                          | 1,091      | (870)          | (88)                                                             |                                                  |                                                                        |",

Related party transactions\n\nKey management personnel comprise executive and non-executive directors and members of the Executive Committee. Compensation of key management personnel is disclosed in note 6.\n\nAmounts paid to the group's retirement benefit plans are set out in note 20.\n\nTransactions with associates and joint ventures are shown below:\n\n| At 31 March                                           |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sales of services to associates and joint ventures    |         5 |         9 |\n| Purchases from associates and joint ventures          |        44 |        51 |\n| Amounts receivable from associates and joint ventures |         2 |         3 |\n| Amounts payable to associates and joint ventures      |         1 |         5 |\n\nOther related party transactions include the purchase of energy from an entity owned by the BT Pension Scheme. Total purchases during the year were \u00a312m (FY21: \u00a313m). \u00a31m was due to the other party as at 31 March 2022 (FY21: \u00a32m). The balance is unsecured and no guarantees have been given.\n\n## 31. Financial commitments\n\nFinancial commitments were as follows:\n\n| At 31 March                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| TV programme rights commitments | 997       | 1,691     |\n| Capital commitments             | 1,596     | 1,370     |\n| Other commitments               | 295       | 263       |\n| Total                           | 2,888     | 3,324     |\n\nTV programme rights commitments, mainly relating to football broadcast rights, are those for which the licence period has not yet started. A sale of our BT Sport operations to which these commitments relate is considered highly probable. The group is contractually committed to future rights payments until the sale completes at which point the commitment will transfer to the new established joint venture. Further details on the transaction and held for sale assets and liabilities are included in note 23.\n\nOther than as disclosed below and in note 19, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees at 31 March 2022 other than those arising in the ordinary course of the group's business and on these no material losses are anticipated. We have insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of our operations. Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.\n\n## Commitments and guarantees\n\n## BT plc\n\nFrom March 2019 a formal guarantee was put in place by BT Group plc to fully and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc ('BT plc') under its corporate bonds. This guarantee has been given in respect of all bonds issued since that date and was retrospectively applied to bonds issued prior to that date. It applies to all bonds issued in BT plc's Yankee, Euro Medium Term Note and hybrid bond programmes, and under the BT plc \u00a3600m 5.75% bonds due in 2028.\n\n## Legal and regulatory proceedings\n\nSee note 19 for contingent liabilities associated with legal and regulatory proceedings.\n\n## 32. Post balance sheet events\n\n## BT Sport\n\nIn May 2022, we reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery (Discovery) to create a sports joint venture (JV) combining BT Sport and Discovery's Eurosport UK business into a separate legal entity with both BT and Discovery each holding a 50% interest and equal voting rights. The production and operational assets of BT Sport will transfer to, and become a wholly owned subsidiary of, Discovery who will manage and operate the production and distribution of the sport content. Discovery will have the option to acquire BT's 50% interest in the JV at specified points during the first four years of the JV. At completion of the transaction, BT is expected to lose control of the BT Sport operations and the group's interest in the combined business is expected to be classified as a Joint Venture. BT will enter into a distribution agreement with the JV to procure the sport content required to continue to supply our existing broadband, TV and mobile customers. BT's agreement with the JV will extend beyond 2030, and for the first four years includes a minimum revenue guarantee of approximately \u00a3500m per annum, after which the agreement will change to a fully variable arrangement.\n\nThe transaction is subject to regulatory approval, but it is expected to conclude by the end of 2022. The transaction meets the held for sale criteria per IFRS 5 and accordingly the asset and liabilities of the BT Sport disposal group have been classified as held for sale at 31 March 2022. Further details are provided in note 23.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the company financial statements\n\n## 1. BT Group plc accounting policies\n\n## Principal activity\n\nThe principal activity of the company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the BT group.\n\n## Accounting basis\n\nAs used in these financial statements and associated notes, the term 'company' refers to BT Group plc (a public company limited by shares). These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. Refer to page 134 for further details of this assessment.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company's profit and loss account has not been presented.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThere have been no new or amended accounting standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\n## Exemptions\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to business combinations, share-based payments, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, and presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. The company intends to continue to take advantage of these exemptions in future years. Further detail is provided below.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 contain a consolidated cash flow statement. Consequently, as permitted by IAS 7 'Statement of Cash flow', the company has not presented its own cash flow statement.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 contain related party disclosures. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in IAS 24, 'Related Party Disclosures' not to disclose transactions with other members of the BT Group.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022 contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with IFRS 7, 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. Consequently, the company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 in respect of its financial instruments.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertaking\n\nInvestment in subsidiary undertaking is stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by continuing to hold the asset and benefiting from the net present value of the future cash flows of the investment.\n\n## Taxation\n\nFull provision is made for deferred taxation on all temporary differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not discounted.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid; final dividends when authorised in general meetings by shareholders. Dividend income is recognised on receipt.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Repurchased shares of the company are recorded in the balance sheet as part of Own shares and presented as a deduction from shareholders' equity at cost.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe company does not incur a charge for share-based payments. However, the issuance by the company of share options and awards to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. An addition to the company's investment in subsidiaries is recorded with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders' funds. The additional capital contribution is determined based on the fair value of options and awards at the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period.\n\n## 2. Investment in subsidiary undertaking\n\n| Cost             | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2020  | 11,024     |\n| Additions        | 72         |\n| At 31 March 2021 | 11,096     |\n| Additions        | 105        |\n| At 31 March 2022 | 11,201     |\n\nAdditions of \u00a3105m (FY21: \u00a372m) comprise capital contributions in respect of share-based payments.\n\nThe company held a 100% investment in BT Group Investments Limited, a company registered in England and Wales, throughout FY22 and FY21.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the company financial statements continued\n\n## 3. Merger reserve\n\nOn 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.70p per share resulting in a total of \u00a380m being credited to the share capital.\n\nThese shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE, which completed on 29 January 2016. As a result of this transaction, a merger reserve was created of \u00a37,424m net of \u00a33m issue costs. The acquisition of EE was structured by way of a share-for-share exchange. This transaction fell within the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 (merger relief) such that no share premium was recorded in respect of the shares issued. The company chose to record its investment in EE at fair value and therefore recorded a merger reserve equal to the value of the share premium which would have been recorded had Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 not been applicable i.e. equal to the difference between the fair value of EE and the aggregate nominal value of the shares issued).\n\nThis merger reserve was initially considered unrealised on the basis it was represented by the investment in EE. This was not considered to represent qualifying consideration (in accordance with Tech 02/10 (Guidance on the determination of realised profits and losses in the context of distributions under the Companies Act 2006)), as superseded by Tech 02/17 (Guidance on realised and distributable profits under the Companies Act 2006).\n\nImmediately following the acquisition of EE, the company's investment in EE was transferred to the company's subsidiary, BT plc, in exchange for an intercompany loan. To the extent the loan is settled in qualifying consideration, the related proportion of the merger reserve is considered realised. Hence the merger reserve is an unrealised reserve until it is realised by the settlement of the intercompany loan by qualifying consideration.\n\nDuring 2020/21, the remaining \u00a31,574m (2019/20: \u00a31,575m) of merger reserve was transferred to realised profit following the settlement of an intercompany loan by qualifying consideration. The merger reserve is now nil.\n\n## 4. Other information\n\n## Dividends\n\nAn interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3227m was paid on 7 February 2022. A final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to approximately \u00a3528m is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022 (FY21: no interim or final dividend paid).\n\n## Employees and directors\n\nThe chairman and the executive and non-executive directors of BT Group plc were the only employees and directors of the company during FY22 and FY21. The costs relating to qualifying services provided to the company's principal subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, are recharged to that company.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures we use are: adjusted revenue, adjusted operating costs, adjusted finance expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share, return on capital employed, normalised free cash flow and net debt. The rationale for using these measures, along with a reconciliation from the nearest measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, are presented below.\n\nThe alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include business restructuring programmes, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific.\n\nDetails of items meeting the definition of specific items in the current and prior year are set out in note 9.\n\nReported revenue, reported operating costs, reported operating profit, reported net finance expense, reported profit before tax and reported earnings per share are the equivalent IFRS measures. A reconciliation from these can be seen in the group income statement on page 129 .\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities (both current and non-current) less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on balance sheet.\n\nOur net debt calculation starts from the expected future undiscounted cash flows that should arise when our financial instruments mature. Currency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swap rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to loans and borrowings, current asset investments and cash equivalents to reflect the effective interest method are removed.\n\nNet debt is a measure of the group's net indebtedness that provides an indicator of overall balance sheet strength. It is a key indicator used by management to assess both the group's cash position and its indebtedness. The use of the term 'net debt' does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.\n\nNet financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities. It allows for the comparison to net debt measures reported before the introduction of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, and reflects a view that lease liabilities are operational debt in substance, rather than financing transactions.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset investments, the most directly comparable IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt, is set out in note 26.",

It is a group KPI that is directly relatable to the outcome of investment decisions.\n\nROCE represents the group's returns as percentage of capital employed.\n\nReturns are defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax. We use an adjusted measure (before specific items) for the reasons explained in the 'specific items' section above.\n\nCapital employed represents equity, debt and debt-like liabilities. We net the derivative financial instruments and cash and cash equivalent balances that we use to manage financial risk against gross debt, and exclude current and deferred tax balances as the measure is determined on a pre-tax basis.\n\nWhile our long-term capital investment programmes such as our full fibre rollout deliver value-creating long term returns, they suppress ROCE in the short-to-medium term.\n\nThe following table sets out the calculation of our ROCE measure. In doing so it reconciles returns to operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, and presents the components of capital employed.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reported operating profit for                                        |           |           |\n| the period                                                           | 2,885     | 2,587     |\n| Share of post tax profits (losses)  of associates and joint ventures | -         | 8         |\n| Specific items (non-finance and tax)                                 | 287       | 481       |\n| Return for the period                                                | 3,172     | 3,076     |\n| Equity, debt and debt-like liabilities                               |           |           |\n| Loans and other borrowings                                           | 16,185    | 16,685    |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 5,760     | 6,152     |\n| Retirement benefit obligations                                       | 1,143     | 5,096     |\n| BDUK grant funding deferral                                          | 488       | 568       |\n| Total equity                                                         | 15,296    | 11,679    |\n| Adjust for balances used to hedge  financial risk                    |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                            | (777)     | (1,000)   |\n| Investments                                                          | (2,713)   | (3,683)   |\n| Net derivative financial instruments Adjust for tax balances         | (221)     | 48        |\n| Net deferred tax liabilities                                         | 1,671     | 440       |\n| Net current tax receivable                                           | (406)     | (197)     |\n| Capital employed                                                     | 36,426    | 35,788    |\n| Return on capital employed                                           | 8.7%      | 8.6%      |\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nIn addition to measuring financial performance of the group and customer-facing units based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before specific items, net non-interest related finance expense, and share of post-tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecommunications sector.\n\nWe consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.\n\nA reconciliation of reported profit for the period, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reported profit for the period                                       | 1,274     | 1,472     |\n| Tax                                                                  | 689       | 332       |\n| Reported profit before tax                                           | 1,963     | 1,804     |\n| Net interest related finance expense                                 | 813       | 773       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                        | 4,405     | 4,347     |\n| EBITDA                                                               | 7,181     | 6,924     |\n| EBITDA specific items                                                | 287       | 481       |\n| Net other finance expense                                            | 109       | 18        |\n| Share of post tax losses (profits) of  associates and joint ventures | -         | (8)       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                      | 7,577     | 7,415     |",

        "page_content": "## Normalised free cash flow\n\nNormalised free cash flow is one of the group's key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured. It is primarily a liquidity measure. However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is defined as free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid and payment of lease liabilities, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), dividends from associates, non-current asset investments, payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, and repayment and raising of debt.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.\n\nA reconciliation from cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to free cash flow and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash generated from operations                                       | 5,962     | 6,251     |\n| Tax paid                                                             | (52)      | (288)     |\n| Net cash inflow from operating  activities                           | 5,910     | 5,963     |\n| Net purchase of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets | (4,607)   | (4,818)   |\n| Free cash flow                                                       | 1,303     | 1,145     |\n| Interest received                                                    | 6         | 6         |\n| Interest paid                                                        | (755)     | (770)     |\n| Add back pension deficit payments                                    | 1,121     | 955       |\n| Remove cash tax benefit of pension  deficit payments                 | -         | (181)     |\n| Dividends from associates                                            | 1         | 5         |\n| Add back net cash flow from specific  items                          | 606       | 390       |\n| Add back net sale of non-current asset  investments                  | (8)       | (11)      |\n| Add back prepayment in respect of  spectrum licence auction          | (223)     | 702       |\n| Remove payment of lease liabilities                                  | (659)     | (782)     |\n| Normalised free cash flow                                            | 1,392     | 1,459     |\n\nBelow we reconcile normalised free cash flow by unit:\n\n| Year ended 31 March       | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Consumer                  | 917       | 714       |\n| Enterprise                | 791       | 1,352     |\n| Global                    | 131       | 187       |\n| Openreach                 | 448       | 486       |\n| Other                     | (895)     | (1,280)   |\n| Intra-group items         | -         | -         |\n| Normalised free cash flow | 1,392     | 1,459     |",
