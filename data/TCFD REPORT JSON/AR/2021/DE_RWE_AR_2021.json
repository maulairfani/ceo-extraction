        "page_content": "## Our energy for a sustainable life.\n\nFor more than 120 years, our product has always been the same: electricity. What has changed is how we produce it. We generated our very /first megawatt hour in 1900 - from hard coal. Later, lignite and nuclear fuel rods were our major energy sources. Today, they have been replaced with natural gas, wind, sun and water. Tomorrow, we will make a full transition to zero-carbon energy sources. Because our objective is to be carbon neutral. And we aim to  accomplish this by 2040.\n\nGreen energy is the lifeblood of a sustainable economy. And demand for it is also rising outside of the energy sector. Be it in industry, transport or buildings, fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas must be replaced by zero-carbon energy sources everywhere. And where it is not possible to switch to green electricity directly, for example in steel production, hydrogen is a suitable alternative - that is hydrogen produced using electricity from renewables. Which we believe also presents us with signi/ficant opportunities. Together with renowned partners from industry and science, we have set our sights on a hydrogen economy. We have already launched about 30 projects. Our long-term goal is to supply both green electricity and green hydrogen, a second product with huge potential demand.\n\nIt takes a major e/ffort to achieve major goals. We plan to invest 50 billion euros in green growth in the current decade - in new wind and solar farms, battery storage, /flexible backup power plants and\n\nelectrolysers for hydrogen production. In net terms, i./uni2009e. after deducting proceeds on the sale of stakes in projects, expenditure will total some 30 billion euros. Our objective here is to double generation capacity in our core business to 50 gigawatts. As we work to accomplish this, we will also make a socially acceptable exit from coal-/fired generation. We want to do this as quickly as possible, while ensuring security of supply at all times.\n\nWhy are we doing all of this? Because as a world leading power provider, we shoulder a unique responsibility for implementing the Paris Climate Agreement. RWE's purpose 'Our energy for a sustainable life' expresses that this responsibility is what drives us and shapes our entrepreneurial actions. We want to play our part in the joint e/ffort to limit the global rise in temperature to far below two degrees Celsius compared to the pre-industrial era. Our accomplishments demonstrate how seriously we are taking this: our carbon dioxide emissions from power production have more than halved since 2012. Based on a review by the independent Science Based Targets initiative, our emission reduction strategy is in line with the Paris climate target. This is scienti/fic proof that we are on the right path.\n\nOur path leads to a sustainable, carbon-neutral energy world.\n\nCome join us!",

The images we are seeing from Ukraine are shocking. For me, the scale of the human su/ffering caused by the war is almost inconceivable. With the attack on Ukraine, Russia's leadership has violated international law and the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination. Sadly, we have been reminded that democracy, freedom and peace cannot be taken for granted and that we must stand up in support of them. Our thoughts and solidarity are with the people in Ukraine, who must endure the horrors of war.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nThe con/flict has massive rami/fications for Europe as a whole. One key aspect is security of energy supply. As a company active in critical infrastructure, we at RWE are well aware of the great responsibility we bear at this time. We therefore support the e/fforts of the EU and the German government to reduce dependence on deliveries of commodities from Russia and simultaneously ensure a reliable supply of energy. We are working on identifying RWE power stations which can provide additional backup capacity. We are also playing our part in diversifying the supply of natural gas. One example of this is our participation in the planned LNG terminal in Brunsb\u00fcttel, Germany, which will be able to receive shipments of lique/fied natural gas and, in the future, green ammonia for hydrogen production.\n\nEven though security of supply is the centre of attention at the moment, the medium- and long-term vision for energy policy remains unchanged. Indeed, expanding renewables and ramping up the hydrogen economy are more important than ever - not only to protect the climate, but also to increase our independence from commodity imports. RWE will make a major contribution to these causes. At our Capital Market Day on 15 November 2021, we informed the public of the action we plan to take. Our Growing Green strategy will make the 2020s a decade of growth for our company. By 2030, we intend to invest a gross sum of around \u20ac50 billion in transforming RWE and thus transitioning to a sustainable energy system. These funds will be spent on the construction of wind and solar farms, battery storage, climate-friendly backup power stations and electrolysers for the production of hydrogen. Our net capital expenditure, which takes into account proceeds from the sale of stakes in projects, is expected to reach \u20ac30 billion. With this, we plan to double generation capacity in our core business to roughly 50 GW by the end of the decade. Earnings from core activities will also increase sharply: for 2030, we project adjusted EBITDA in the order of \u20ac5 billion, representing an increase of around 80/uni2009% compared to 2021. These goals are ambitious, but realistic. This was re/flected in the stock market's positive reaction to our Growing Green strategy, as the RWE share closed trading that day with a strong gain and continued to perform well in the following weeks.",

        "page_content": "To our investors\n\nLetter from the CEO\n\n2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\nWe are pursuing our growth strategy with determination. Since the start of 2021, we have commissioned 14 wind and solar farms with a total capacity of 1.2 GW, despite supply chain issues that led to delays for some projects. In the spring of 2021, we started building the So/fia wind farm o/ff the eastern coast of the UK, which will set new standards with its planned capacity of 1.4 GW. In addition, we set the stage for a number of attractive major projects. In auctions for new o/ffshore wind farm sites in Great Britain, Germany, Denmark and the USA we secured leases for sites where we can build up to 8 GW of generation capacity.\n\nThe past year was challenging in many respects, and thus we are even more pleased that we outperformed our /financial targets. At \u20ac3,650 million, our adjusted EBITDA was well above the range we had projected. We met or exceeded the expectations in all of the segments. These achievements are driven by our dedicated employees, who have put their all into ensuring our company's continued success. I'd like to express my gratitude to all of them, on behalf of the entire Executive Board. Coming against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, our performance in 2021 is all the more impressive. Thanks to the /flexibility and dedication of our employees, we were able to maintain all of our critical operations at all times.\n\nThe catastrophic /flooding in western Germany was a de/fining moment in the summer of 2021. All of us can recall the scenes of utter devastation. Among the many people who lost their lives was an employee of one of RWE's partner companies. We would like to extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. The /floods impacted a number of our sites. Nevertheless, we were able to limit the resulting downtime at the Inden opencast mine and many of our run-of-river power stations to just a few days. We have the untiring e/fforts of our people to thank for this. Many of them also rolled up their sleeves and personally helped out those in need. RWE itself provided materials, machinery and funds totalling around \u20ac2 million, with one quarter of the donations coming from our employees.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther information\n\nIn closing, let me brie/fly look ahead to /fiscal 2022. Despite the uncertain course of the con/flict in Ukraine and its consequences, I am con/fident that we can continue to generate good earnings as was the case in 2021. At present, our projection for adjusted EBITDA foresees a range of \u20ac3.6 billion to \u20ac4.0 billion. In this regard, one key factor will be the earnings contributions of our new wind and solar farms. As you can see, our growth strategy is paying o/ff. That said, we are at the very beginning of a long and challenging journey. RWE's transformation involves much more than billions of euros of investment. Passion, the ability to change, and, sometimes, courage are all key ingredients. I am convinced that RWE has all these qualities. And that means you, dear shareholders, can count on us. Thank you for your trust and con/fidence!  I hope you'll continue with us on this exciting journey.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n<!-- image -->",

It justifies the trust investors place in our company.'\n\nDr. Werner Brandt, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of RWE AG\n\nYou might be familiar with the proverb 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.' More often than not, this is true. But at RWE, the journey from a past dominated by fossil fuel to a carbon-neutral future began with a whole series of steps. Investors, media representatives and the public bore witness to the speed at which the company seeks to continue this journey on 15 November 2021. That was the day on which management presented its ambitious growth strategy under the motto 'Growing Green,' which the Supervisory Board had been heavily involved in developing. RWE aims to invest approximately \u20ac50 billion in the company's green transformation from 2021 to 2030,\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nthus contributing to the success of the energy transition. After subtracting proceeds on the sale of stakes in projects, net investments will amount to some \u20ac30 billion. RWE will use these funds to build renewable generation assets, battery storage systems, /flexible backup power stations and electrolysers for hydrogen production with a total capacity of 25 GW. Based on the criteria established by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, over 90 percent of the capital expenditure should contribute to environmental sustainability. Our growth campaign should drive the Group's adjusted EBITDA up to about \u20ac5 billion by 2030 although the non-core business with coal and nuclear power plants will have stopped contributing to earnings by then. Such a transformation is unrivalled in terms of speed, sustainability and returns.\n\nEvery departure for new horizons involves bidding farewell to the past. RWE has set out to become carbon neutral along the entire value chain by 2040. The key to achieving this goal is the phaseout of electricity generation from coal, which in Germany goes hand in hand with an exit from nuclear energy. This is a Herculean task for RWE, both /financially and socially. Last year, our company decommissioned its last two German hard coal-/fired power plants, /five lignite units and the Gundremmingen C nuclear power station. So this part of our transformation is also progressing at speed, as it should. However, we must not forget that the power plants guaranteed a reliable supply of electricity and that, /first and foremost, we have the skilled and motivated sta/ff on site to thank for that. Many of them dedicated their entire working life to the safe and pro/fitable operation of the stations. To honour this loyalty, RWE will stand by its employees, ensuring that the personnel reduction is socially acceptable. Here, our focus rests in particular on the approximately 8,500 people working in the Rhenish lignite mining region. One can only consider a transformation successful if no one is left behind. RWE is absolutely determined to rise to this challenge.\n\nLast year was a momentous one, and sadly the second dominated by the coronavirus pandemic. Fortunately, its e/ffects on our company and sta/ff remained manageable. RWE took extensive protective measures, thereby ensuring that our key personnel were able to continue working almost without restrictions. Our company demonstrated yet again how",

        "page_content": "To our investors\n\nSupervisory Board report\n\n2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\nwell it can navigate through crises. The Supervisory Board was also able to ful/fil its duties without exceptions. Six of our seven meetings - the only exception being the session in September - and nearly all committee meetings were held virtually. The same applied to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) that took place on 28 April 2021. We bene/fited from the experience gained at our /first purely digital Annual General Meeting held in the preceding year. In addition, we reacted to the wishes expressed by our investors by introducing some new services. For example, the speeches by the CEO and CFO as well as my report were published on the company's website before the AGM. Moreover, our shareholders had the opportunity to submit questions and remarks in advance. We will have to hold a purely virtual Annual General Meeting once again in 2022. We hope that you, our valued shareholders, accept this decision in light of the continued exposure to risks arising from COVID-19. No AGM is worth risking one's health.\n\nAt RWE, our hearts went out to the many victims of the catastrophic /floods in the summer in the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. The /floodwater claimed the life of an employee of a partner company at the Inden opencast lignite mine. We would like to express our deepest condolences to the family and friends of those who died in this tragic event. RWE was a/ffected by the /floods at several of its locations. Both Inden and nearly all our run-of-river power plants in the region were forced to interrupt operations. However, the stations and mines were able to resume operations after a few days. We have the huge dedication of our employees to thank for this. I was deeply touched by their commitment both on and o/ff site and the way everyone pulled together throughout the entire Group. As sad as the catastrophic /floods were, they reminded us of the phenomenal people we have at RWE - a team on which we can rely and we can be proud of.\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nUnfortunately, the beginning of this year is plagued by a horrifying event. The Russian invasion of Ukraine signals a turning point for the whole of Europe. I'm absolutely appalled at this act of aggression, which is a serious breach of international law. The war against Ukraine demonstrates that peace and freedom are by no means a matter of course in Europe and that we must take decisive action to preserve these ideals. We discussed the political and economic consequences of the crisis in Ukraine at the Supervisory Board meeting we held on 9 March 2022. If the situation escalates, we may face bottlenecks on Europe's energy markets, which would also a/ffect RWE. However, after assessing the potential developments in depth, we currently believe that the risks to which the Group is exposed are manageable. Our main concern is for the people in Ukraine for whom we feel deeply during these di/fficult times.\n\nChanges in personnel on the Executive and Supervisory Boards. The past year was a landmark both in terms of strategy and personnel. RWE AG has had a new CEO since 1 May 2021: Markus Krebber, our former CFO, who joined the Group in 2012. His predecessor, Rolf Martin Schmitz, retired from the Executive Board on 30 April, 2021 after four-and-ahalf years at the helm. Together with Markus, he initiated RWE's transformation into a leading renewable energy company. It is with great pleasure that I look back on the successful work we did with Rolf, but I also look forward to continuing this journey with Markus and his team. Zvezdana Seeger and Michael M\u00fcller joined the team in November 2020. Zvezdana is our Chief HR O/fficer and Labour Director. Michael took over as CFO from Markus Krebber with e/ffect from 1 May 2021.\n\nThe Supervisory Board also went through some personnel changes last year. On conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021, the tenures of all the members of this corporate body expired. However, it was impossible for the ten employee representatives to be elected as the Assembly of Delegates, which is charged with this task, was not able to convene until 15 September owing to the restrictions imposed to combat COVID-19. Therefore, resta/ffing for the transitional period was implemented by court order.",

        "page_content": "To our investors\n\n## Supervisory Board report\n\n2\n\nThe incumbent employee representatives were reappointed to the Supervisory Board by the Essen District Court. In alphabetical order, they were Michael Bochinsky, Sandra Bossemeyer, Martin Br\u00f6ker, Frank Bsirske, Anja Dubbert, Matthias D\u00fcrbaum, Harald Louis, Ralf Sikorski, Marion Weckes and Leonhard Zubrowski.\n\nBy contrast, the election of the shareholder representatives was carried out as planned at the virtual Annual General Meeting on 28 April: Ute Gerbaulet, Hans-Peter Keitel, Monika Kircher, G\u00fcnther Schartz, Erhard Schipporeit, Ullrich Sierau and I received the votes required to serve for another term. Dagmar M\u00fchlenfeld, Peter Ottmann and Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel did not run for re-election. Hans B\u00fcnting, Hauke Stars and Helle Valentin were elected members of the Supervisory Board in their place.\n\nThe elections involved a new approach, which I consider to be a great step forward: the shareholder representatives received shortened and staggered tenures. Following established practice in Germany, they used to be elected with identical /five-year tenures. The advantage of shortening terms is that the Supervisory Board's composition can be adapted to new demands faster than before. Staggered tenures prevent too many people from leaving the corporate body at the same time, causing valuable experience to be lost. At the 2021 Annual General Meeting, /five candidates were elected for three years, and another /five were elected for four years. Future by-elections and new elections to the Supervisory Board will be for three-year terms only.\n\nAt its constituent meeting following the Annual General Meeting, the Supervisory Board re-elected me its Chairman. I consider this to be in recognition of my work to date and thank my colleagues for the trust they have placed in me. The corporate body chose Frank Bsirske as Deputy Chairman. Furthermore, we resta/ffed the committees. Germany's law on strengthening the integrity of the /financial market, which was enacted in mid-2021, stipulates that each supervisory board must have two independent experts in /finance with in-depth knowledge of accounting and /financial statement audits. Thanks to Erhard Schipporeit, Chairman of the Audit Committee, and Monika Kirchner, who is also a member of this committee, we ful/fil this requirement.\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nOn 15 September 2021, the Assembly of Delegates /finally elected the employee representatives to the Supervisory Board. This ended the tenure of the court-appointed members. Ralf Sikorski, Michael Bochinsky, Sandra Bossemeyer, Matthias D\u00fcrbaum, Harald Louis and Marion Weckes were re-elected. Martin Br\u00f6ker, Frank Bsirske, Anja Dubbert and Leonhard Zubrowski retired from their o/ffices. Reiner van Limbeck, Dagmar Paasch, Dirk Schumacher and Andreas Wagner replaced them as new members of the Supervisory Board. The terms of all employee representatives will end on conclusion of the 2026 Annual General Meeting, in compliance with the Articles of Incorporation. As Frank Bsirske left the corporate body, the position of my Deputy had to be resta/ffed. Ralf Sikorski was elected to this o/ffice at the /first meeting of all new Supervisory Board members on 21 September. Furthermore, positions on the committees that were vacated by exiting employee representatives were reassigned.\n\nSoon thereafter, there was another personnel change among the shareholder representatives. G\u00fcnther Schartz resigned from his o/ffice as of 30 September 2021. Thereupon, Thomas Kufen was appointed to the corporate body by the Essen District Court with e/ffect from 18 October 2021. We are pleased to have found a worthy successor to Mr. Schartz in him. As mayor of the energy metropolis Essen, he is very familiar with our sector and with RWE. We will submit the resta/ffing to the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022 for the passage of a corresponding resolution.\n\nOne of RWE's good traditions is the extensive support that new Supervisory Board members receive from the company in familiarising themselves with their tasks. They go through a tried-and-tested onboarding process to become acquainted with RWE's business model, the Group's structures and certain topics as necessary. The Board O/ffice, which is assigned to Legal, has a co-ordinating function. Moreover, the Board O/ffice informs them of their rights and duties, is of assistance through one-on-ones and ensures the provision of documents and privileges required to exchange digital information.\n\nMore detailed information on the new Supervisory Board members and the composition of the committees can be found on pages 220 et seqq. of this report.",

I would now like to touch on the Supervisory Board's activity in the /fiscal year that just ended. As usual, we ful/filled all of the duties imposed on us by German law and the Articles of Incorporation. We advised the Executive Board on running the company and monitored its actions with great care. We were involved in all fundamental decisions. The Executive Board informed us of all material aspects of business developments, the earnings situation as well as the risks and the management thereof both verbally and in writing. This was done regularly, extensively and in a timely fashion. In addition, I was constantly in touch with the Executive Board, allowing us to discuss major developments without delay.\n\nWhen in session, we concerned ourselves with RWE's growth strategy both repeatedly and in great depth. Further focal points of debate were the e/ffects of the coronavirus pandemic, the resta/ffing of the Executive Board and the German coal phaseout. We took our decisions on the basis of detailed reports and draft resolutions submitted by the Executive Board, which we discussed in depth in our plenary sessions and committees. We were also informed by the Executive Board of projects and transactions of special importance or urgency in extraordinary meetings as well as between meetings. We passed the resolutions required of us by German law or the Articles of Incorporation, occasionally by circular.\n\nOne of the Supervisory Board's key tasks is maintaining dialogue with the shareholders. As I do not believe that this exchange of information should be limited to the Annual General Meeting, I have been holding regular talks with investors and shareholder representatives for many years now. This is a practice I maintained despite COVID-19. The focal points of these talks were the sta/ffing of the Supervisory Board, the staggered tenures, the Executive Board remuneration system, RWE's strategy and the coal phaseout.\n\nWe took the basic and advanced training measures needed to ful/fil our tasks on our own initiative. The company helped us by organising in-house informational events on topics of special relevance.\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nMain points of debate of the Supervisory Board meetings. Last year, the Supervisory Board convened for seven meetings, including one constituent and one extraordinary session. In our meetings, we were informed by the Executive Board in great detail of transactions and events of signi/ficance to RWE. We discussed certain agenda items without involving the Executive Board. The shareholder and employee representatives met separately before the Supervisory Board meetings, in order to consult on matters in a smaller circle and establish joint positions where necessary.\n\n## The following issues were discussed at our meetings:\n\n- \u00b7  Our /first session last year took place on 10 March. We discussed and approved the 2020 /financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated /financial statements, and the separate Non-/financial Report. In addition, we passed a resolution to hold last year's Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021 as a purely online event. At this meeting, I reported on talks I had held with institutional investors and shareholder representatives in the months prior. The agenda also included legal matters, e./uni2009g. Germany's new Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, which requires companies to ensure that human rights are observed in their supply chains. We also concerned ourselves extensively with the success achieved by RWE in an auction in Great Britain, at which the company won the rights to build wind farms on two o/ffshore sites.\n- \u00b7  We convened in two sessions on 28 April, the /first of which was mainly dedicated to preparing the Annual General Meeting, which took place thereafter. We held the constituent meeting of the Supervisory Board with the newly elected shareholder representatives right after the AGM. As set out earlier, the employee representatives had been appointed by court order, because the Assembly of Delegates had to be postponed due to COVID-19. In addition to the election of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and his Deputy, the meeting centred on sta/ffing the committees. By amending the Articles of Incorporation, we were able to enlarge the Strategy and Sustainability Committee by two to eight members due to its increased importance and reduce the Executive Committee by two to six members in exchange.",

The Court found that the law was insu/fficient because it identi/fied the risk of substantial emissions reductions being shifted to future generations, placing too heavy a burden on them. The Executive Board informed us that RWE expanded its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 to include the company's entire value chain. Another piece of good news was the start of COVID-19 vaccination by RWE company physicians.\n- \u00b7  In our session on 21 September - the only in-person meeting last year - we welcomed the newly elected employee representatives to the Supervisory Board. As mentioned before, the Assembly of Delegates had convened a few days earlier. This resulted in some changes in personnel, which required seats on the committees to be resta/ffed and the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board to be elected anew. Another main point of debate was RWE's strategy. I stated earlier that management informed the public of the company's roadmap for the current decade on 15 November. The Supervisory Board was greatly involved in developing the strategic guidelines. During the meeting in September, we focused on management's growth plans in relation to RWE's green core business and the phaseout of coal-/fired power generation. Talks also centred on the catastrophic /floods in the west of Germany. The Executive Board kept us abreast of the situation at the a/ffected sites and of RWE's aid measures. Furthermore, we discussed the statutory transparency regulations applicable to the remuneration of the Executive Board and appointed the auditor of the Remuneration Report and of the Non-/financial Report for /fiscal 2021.\n- \u00b7  On 10 October, we held an extraordinary meeting which focused on the extreme rise in commodity prices and its e/ffects on RWE. The collateral we pledge for electricity forward contracts was at times much higher than previous levels. Thanks to a substantial liquidity bu/ffer and our highly professional /financial management, however, the company was able to meet its payment commitments at all times.\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n- \u00b7  In our session on 10 December, we reviewed and adopted the company planning for /fiscal 2022. Moreover, we ful/filled our corporate governance reporting duties: together with the Executive Board, we adopted an updated statement of compliance in accordance with Section 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act and approved the parts of the Corporate Governance Declaration relating to the Supervisory Board pursuant to Section 289a of the German Commercial Code. The documents are available at www.rwe.com/ statement-of-compliance and www.rwe.com/corporate-governance-declaration respectively. Further topics discussed were the liquidity position, plans to reorganise the renewable energy business and the forming of the new coalition government after Germany's general elections on 26 September. We also discussed at great length the announcement of the coalition partners to accelerate the coal phaseout. Here, the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board have a/ffirmed their commitment to phasing out RWE's lignite-/fired power generation in agreement with politicians and after weighing up all interests. Another item on the agenda was the positive feedback from analysts and investors on our Capital Market Day in November. In a nutshell, these stakeholder groups believe that we are charting the right course and have realistic goals. This con/firmed that RWE's growth and climate strategy is both ambitious and credible. It justi/fies the trust investors place in our company.\n\nSupervisory Board committees. Last year, the Supervisory Board had six standing committees, the members of which are listed on page 225. These committees are charged with preparing topics and resolutions for plenary sessions. In certain cases, they exercise decision-making powers if they have been conferred on them by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is informed of the work of the committees by their chairs at every ordinary meeting. In the year under review, a total of 13 committee meetings were held, which I would like to touch upon in more detail.\n\n- \u00b7  The Executive Committee held one meeting, which took place in December. As usual, the objective was to discuss the company's planning for /fiscal 2022 and the outlook on the two subsequent years.",

It discussed the /financial statements with the Executive Board before they were published and received reports on the outcome of the audits and audit-like reviews from the independent auditors. Furthermore, the Audit Committee submitted a recommendation to the Supervisory Board regarding the election of the independent auditors for /fiscal 2021, prepared the grant of the audit award to the independent auditors including the fee agreement, and set the priorities of the audit. It also veri/fied the independence of the auditors and the quality of the audit. Current laws require RWE to appoint new independent auditors for no later than /fiscal 2024. The Committee has already begun preparations for the invitation to tender. Furthermore, as usual, the Audit Committee was informed of the e/ffectiveness of the accounting-related Internal Control System (ICS). The report did not reveal any issues that would call the e/ffectiveness of the ICS into question. Additional points of focus were the planning and /findings of internal audits, RWE's exposure to risk pursuant to the German Corporate Control and Transparency Act (KonTraG), the risk management system of RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading, data security, compliance matters as well as legal and tax issues. Related party transactions also featured on the agenda. The Committee veri/fied that the transactions were in line with practices generally accepted on the market, as required by the German law on the implementation of the Second Shareholders Directive.

The members of the Supervisory Board are obliged by law and the German Corporate Governance Code to immediately disclose any con/flicts of interest they have. We were not noti/fied of any such con/flict in /fiscal 2021.\n\n## Financial statements for /fiscal 2021. PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH\n\nWirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC) audited and issued an unquali/fied auditor's opinion on the 2021 /financial statements of RWE AG, which were prepared by the Executive Board in compliance with the German Commercial Code, the /financial statements of the Group prepared pursuant to Section 315a of the German Commercial Code in compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as well as the combined review of operations for RWE AG and the Group including the accounts. The opinion was signed by the auditors in charge, Markus Dittmann and Aissata Tour\u00e9. In addition, PwC subjected the Non-/financial Report to a limited assurance audit and found that the Executive Board had established an appropriate early risk detection system. The company had been elected independent auditor by the 2021 Annual General Meeting. Thereafter, the Supervisory Board had commissioned it to audit the aforementioned /financial statements and reports.\n\nThe 2021 Annual Report and the audit reports as well as documents supporting the annual /financial statements were submitted to the members of the Supervisory Board in good time. Furthermore, the Executive Board commented on the documents at the Supervisory Board's balance sheet meeting of 9 March 2022. The independent auditors reported in this session on the material results of the audit and were available to provide supplementary information. The Audit Committee had previously concerned itself in depth with the /financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated /financial statements, as well as audit reports during its meeting on the preceding day, with the auditors present. It recommended that the Supervisory Board approve the /financial statements as well as the appropriation of distributable pro/fit proposed by the Executive Board. The /financial statements of RWE AG, the consolidated /financial statements, the combined review of operations, the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of distributable pro/fit, and the Non-/financial Report were reviewed by the Supervisory Board. The corporate body did not raise any objections as a result of this review. As recommended by the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board endorsed the /findings of the audits of the /financial statements of RWE AG and the consolidated /financial statements and approved both /financial statements. The 2021 annual /financial statements are therefore adopted. The Supervisory Board concurs with the Executive Board's proposal regarding the appropriation of pro/fits, which envisages paying a dividend of \u20ac0.90 per share.\n\n3\n\n5",

The past /fiscal year showed that our company can rely on the expertise and dedication of its employees. Despite the coronavirus and the substantial /financial loss sustained due to an unusually harsh cold snap in Texas, 2021 turned out to be a very successful year. On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to express our deep-felt gratitude to the sta/ff members who made this possible. As mentioned earlier, I was extremely impressed by how everyone pulled together and was willing to pitch in to provide the much needed assistance in the wake of the catastrophic /floods in parts of western Germany. So many people made donations and rolled up their sleeves, demonstrating what it means to stand united. I have always been proud to be the Chairman of RWE's Supervisory Board.

Driven by a global economic upturn, the DAX repeatedly hit new all-time highs. Germany's blue chip index closed the year with a strong gain of 16/uni2009%. The RWE share was unable to match this pace, after having consistently left the DAX far behind in the four preceding years. The total return of the RWE share, made up of the change in price and the dividend, amounted to 6/uni2009%. In part, the shortfall versus the DAX is due to the fact that utility stocks often trail cyclical shares when the economy trends upwards. By contrast, we made the headlines on the debt capital market: RWE AG issued its /first green bonds in 2021, raising \u20ac1.85 billion for the expansion of renewables.\n\nDAX up 16/uni2009% thanks to economic recovery. Although 2021 was overshadowed by the COVID-19 crisis, optimism prevailed on international stock markets. The DAX continued its course for recovery which began in 2020, climbing from one all-time high to the next. It closed the year at 15,885 points, representing a return of 16/uni2009%. The resurgence of the stock markets was driven by a marked acceleration of the economy. Certain sectors such as automotive experienced a veritable boom despite worldwide logistical problems. Share prices were also positively a/ffected by the European Central Bank maintaining its expansionary monetary policy despite mounting in/flation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRWE share registers 6/uni2009% total return. The RWE share also posted gains, albeit smaller than those recorded by the DAX. It closed the month of December 2021 at \u20ac35.72. Taking account of the dividend of \u20ac0.85 paid in May 2021, this results in a total return of 6/uni2009% for the year. Therefore, our share was outperformed not only by the DAX but also by the STOXX Europe 600 Utilities, which registered a gain of 9/uni2009%. Financial analysts con/firm the attractive earnings prospects of renewable energy companies like RWE. However, the economic upswing has resulted in a return to strong investment in cyclical stocks. In addition, some capital market participants fear that mounting competitive pressure in the renewable energy business, e./uni2009g. created by oil companies entering the market, and rising material costs, may make wind and solar projects less pro/fitable. In February 2021, we su/ffered substantial /financial losses due to extreme weather conditions in Texas, which also weighed on the share price. RWE stock received tailwind in November when we published our growth plans and earnings prospects for the current decade at a Capital Market Day (see pages 25 et seqq.). RWE made up for ground lost to the DAX and the sector index thereafter.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5",

RWE AG issued its /first green bond in June 2021. The paper has a nominal volume of \u20ac500 million, a ten-year tenor and a 0.625/uni2009% coupon. Later in the year, two more green bonds were placed on the market: one with a volume of \u20ac750 million, a 0.5/uni2009% coupon and a seven-year tenor, and another with a volume of \u20ac600 million, a 1.0/uni2009% coupon and a twelve-year tenor. All three of the issuances met with keen interest among investors. Capital raised by the issuance of green bonds must be spent on projects that contribute to protecting the environment and climate. RWE's green bond policy stipulates that proceeds on issuances be spent on wind and solar farms exclusively. This is in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. One of these objectives is to increase the share of the global energy mix accounted for by renewables. RWE's rules also comply with the generally accepted Green Bond Principles of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). This has been certi/fied by Sustainalytics, a prominent sustainability agency.\n\nWe have summarised the main features of our three green bonds in the above table. In addition, we have two hybrid bonds outstanding (\u20ac282 million and US$317 million) with earliest redemption dates in 2025 and 2026, respectively. A residual amount (\u20ac12.2 million) of a standard bond that matures in 2037 - which we could not fully transfer to innogy, a former subsidiary of ours acquired by E.ON, at the end of 2016 - has not been redeemed, either.

By 2030, we intend to invest \u20ac50 billion in renewables, battery storage, gas-fired power stations and electrolysers. Including proceeds from selling stakes in projects, we foresee net investments of \u20ac30 billion. This will double our generation capacity in these technologies to 50 GW by 2030. At the same time, we are successively phasing out electricity generated from coal and setting the stage for RWE to be carbon neutral by no later than 2040. This will not only make RWE greener, but also more profitable. Our 2030 goal is to achieve an adjusted EBITDA in our core business segments of \u20ac5 billion. This would represent an increase of around 80/uni2009% compared to 2021.\n\nWho we are and what we do. RWE is a leading international energy company headquartered in Essen, Germany, with a focus on power generation. Energy sources such as wind and solar are an increasingly important part of our business. Our core activities also include the storage of electricity and natural gas, the hydrogen business, trading of energyrelated commodities and innovative energy solutions for industrial customers. We generated revenues of \u20ac24.5 billion in fiscal 2021. Our key markets are Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the USA. In the field of renewables, we are also active in a whole host of other countries, for example in Poland, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Australia. We intend to position ourselves even more broadly geographically in our renewables business. For example, we are stepping up our efforts to win offshore wind projects in new markets such as Norway, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\n3\n\nResponsibility statement\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther information\n\nCarbon-neutral energy - the great challenge of our time. In most industrial countries, energy policy is shaped by climate change. In the past, the main objective was to provide a reliable, affordable supply of electricity and fuel, whereas nowadays - more so than ever before - our energy consumption should not be to the detriment of the Earth's temperature. Most industrialised countries where we do business want to minimise their emissions of greenhouse gases generated by the use of fossil fuels. Over the long run, the goal is to achieve climate neutrality, i./uni2009e. a state in which humankind zeroes out its net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The European Union and the UK want to be climate neutral by 2050, while Germany wishes to reach this goal by 2045. Both these objectives call for the fundamental restructuring of the way in which companies and households consume energy. This transformation has many aspects. For the energy industry, the following issues need to be addressed:\n\n- \u00b7 Decarbonising electricity generation. The energy transition is basically about abandoning electricity generation from fossil fuels and embracing renewables. Coal and natural gas are finite resources, the use of which leads to the emission of greenhouse gases. By contrast, wind, solar and hydro are energy sources which do not generate CO 2 emissions, are available in abundance and thus form the foundation for a sustainable supply of electricity and heat. The EU has set the goal of covering at least 32/uni2009% of final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030. At present, work is under way on a directive which calls for an even higher proportion of at least 40/uni2009%. Numerous countries both inside and outside the EU have specific plans to phase out the use of coal and ambitiously expand renewables.",

        "page_content": "To our investors\n\n2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nStrategy\n\n- \u00b7 Creating storage and backup capacities. Electricity generation using renewable sources depends on the weather conditions as well as the time of day and the season. Sometimes, renewables can only cover a fraction of demand, while at other times, their generation exceeds local needs so much that production actually has to be throttled. Consequently, as energy supply becomes increasingly reliant on wind and solar farms, power storage systems become ever more important for stabilising the power grids. Furthermore, we need more environmentally-friendly, flexible generation assets, which can reliably produce power when there is no wind and no sunshine. Modern gas-fired power stations that can be retrofitted to run on carbon-free fuels like hydrogen will be well-positioned for this task, once the necessary volumes of such fuels are available.\n- \u00b7 Replacing fossil fuels with green power. Simply reducing emissions in the power generation sector is not enough to achieve climate neutrality. At present, over 70/uni2009% of European energy consumption is still covered by oil, coal and natural gas. Electrification in other words switching energy consumption to electricity produced with carbon-neutral methods, e./uni2009g. by using heat pumps instead of oil and gas heating systems - also enables significant emission reductions in the manufacturing, heat and transportation sectors. Thus, over the long run, demand for electricity in our markets will expand significantly.\n- \u00b7 Establishing the hydrogen economy. The economy can only be completely decarbonised if solutions are also found for applications where direct electrification is not an option. Examples of this are the production of steel and fertilisers as well as aviation and shipping. In the near future, hydrogen produced with zero-carbon methods would be a solution. Taking a longer-term perspective, using hydrogen as a storage medium will also be a key component of a climate-neutral energy system. According to the European Commission, by 2030 the EU should have electrolysers with a total capacity of at least 40 GW capable of producing 10 million metric tons of hydrogen annually. Germany is looking to expand its electrolysis capacity to 10 GW by the end of the decade, as recently announced by the new coalition government comprising the SPD, the Greens and the FDP.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther information\n\nWe're driving the energy transition. RWE is well positioned to contribute to transforming the energy sector and the broader economy in all of the areas discussed above. And that is precisely what we are doing, by investing billions of euros in wind power, photovoltaics, battery storage and green hydrogen, phasing out coal-based generation, building environmentally friendly backup capacities and helping industrial customers optimise their energy consumption. These activities make us a driving force in the energy transition and allow us to support the countries where we do business in their efforts to achieve climate protection targets. Our commitment in this regard is reflected by our own ambitious plans: we want to be carbon neutral by 2040 at the latest, ten years earlier than the EU. Not only does this apply to our own greenhouse gas emissions (referred to as Scope 1), it also covers the upstream and downstream value chain (Scope 2 and Scope 3). We have also set ourselves ambitious goals for the current decade: by 2030, we want to reduce our emissions by 50/uni2009% (Scope 1 and 2) and 30/uni2009% (Scope 3) compared to 2019. At the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, the global community committed to limiting the increase in average global temperatures to well below two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. Our actions are in line with this target, as was officially confirmed by the independent Science Based Targets initiative at the end of 2020. However, our ambitions do not end there. Moving forward, we have also set our sights on ensuring we adhere to the target of 1.5 degrees Celsius established at the Paris Climate Conference.\n\nSustainability - at the heart of our corporate culture. A sustainable business involves far more than cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainability is measured in a myriad of ways. The expression is generally used in relation to the environment, society and governance (ESG). Last year, we reassessed our approach to the topic of sustainability. Working together with internal and external experts, we defined the fields of action that are of most significance to RWE and what we want to achieve in these areas. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, one of our most important environmental efforts is preserving biodiversity at the sites where we operate. In particular, this involves the recultivation of mining areas, as well as the erection, operation and decommissioning of wind farms. We want to reduce the use of natural resources and significantly boost our recycling ratio at the same time.",

We want to live up to this responsibility across all our sites. In the Rhenish lignite mining region, we are acutely aware of our prime-aged employees who are losing their jobs due to the coal phaseout, and are in the process of securing socially acceptable solutions to this issue. Occupational health and safety is another key concern of ours. Our aim is to ensure that the employees at our sites leave work at the end of each day as healthy as when they arrived. We also advocate for a diverse, inclusive corporate culture. Diversity has many facets. One is gender equality when filling leadership roles within the company. In our core business, which covers all Group activities with the exception of Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear, the share of women in executive positions was 19/uni2009% at the end of 2021. We aim to reach 30/uni2009% by 2030.\n\nOur mission statement 'Our energy for a sustainable life' truly encompasses our purpose as a company and confirms that sustainability is a principle that guides our actions. Our commitment in this regard is made tangible by the fact that achievement of ESG targets has a direct impact on the level of Executive Board remuneration. Further information on our ESG goals and accomplishments can be found in our Sustainability Report and in the separate Non-financial Report in accordance with Section 315b, Paragraph 3 of the German Commercial Code. The reports for fiscal 2021 will be published in April 2022 and will be accessible at www.rwe.com/responsibility-and-sustainability. Our website also has further information on how independent rating agencies assess our sustainability strategy at www.rwe.com/ratings-and-rankings.\n\nGrowing Green - our strategic roadmap to 2030. In mid-November 2021, we informed the public about the strategy and goals for our business activities during the current decade at our Capital Market Day event. An ambitious growth programme in our green core business forms the centrepiece of our strategy, which is entitled 'Growing Green'. In the 10-year period from 2021 to the end of 2030, we intend to invest approximately \u20ac50 billion in new wind farms, photovoltaic assets, battery storage, gas-fired power plants and electrolysers.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nThis capital expenditure will be divided up roughly four ways between Germany, the United Kingdom, the USA and our other markets. In net terms, i./uni2009e. taking into account cash flows from divestments, we expect that our investments will total around \u20ac30 billion. We will use these funds to massively expand our climate-friendly generation capabilities. Including battery storage and electrolysers, we intend to have a generation capacity of around 50 GW by 2030. This target is a pro-rata figure, meaning we state our capacity according to our shareholding ratios. In order to reach 50 GW, we will have to build approx. 25 GW. At 21 GW, the majority of this capacity will come from wind farms, solar assets and battery storage. It will be supplemented by flexible gas-fired power stations and electrolysers with a total installed capacity of 2 GW each. Our adjusted EBITDA will also rise sharply in conjunction with our generation capacities. For 2030, we project a level of \u20ac5 billion, generated solely from our green core business. By comparison, in fiscal 2021 we posted adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac2.8 billion from our core activities.\n\nTurning to the individual components of our growth programme:\n\n- \u00b7 Offshore Wind. We have been active in offshore wind for 20 years now, making us a world leader in this field. At the end of 2021, our offshore wind power portfolio had a total prorata capacity of 2.4 GW. This figure is expected to hit 8 GW by 2030. We currently operate wind farms in the coastal waters of the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Denmark. Europe is our most important region in terms of growth. Examples for this include projects such as Sofia (UK/uni2009//uni20091,400 MW), Kaskasi (Germany/uni2009//uni2009342 MW), Thor (Denmark/uni2009//uni20091,000 MW) and F./uni2009E./uni2009W. Baltic II (Poland/uni2009//uni2009350 MW). We are also looking to markets outside of Europe: together with local partners, we are working on offshore wind projects in the USA, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. But we are interested in more than just regional opportunities, as we want to tap into new technological options as well. In order to realise the full potential of offshore wind, we will also be operating wind turbines on floating platforms in the future. Together with our partners, we are exploring which types of foundations are best suited for this (see page 30 et seq.). The first prototype co-engineered by RWE - the TetraSpar Demonstrator off the coast of Norway - started operating in autumn 2021.",

We also have more than two decades of experience in onshore wind and rank among the global leaders, with pro-rata generation capacity of 7 GW. We intend to boost this figure to 12 GW by 2030. In terms of solar, where our capacity currently stands at 0.5 GW, we are still in the start phase. However, we aim for a steep expansion curve towards 8 GW by the end of the decade. We are concentrating our onshore wind and solar efforts on North America and Europe, where we are looking to diversify geographically. For instance, we have partnered with Public Power Corporation (PPC), Greece's largest energy group, to position ourselves as a solar power producer in its home market. In the United States, we are also expanding into new territories. Evidence of this can be found at Scioto Ridge, our first wind farm in Ohio, which started operating in May 2021. Our main focus in terms of growth ventures rests on countries and market segments harbouring potential for more than one technology, e./uni2009g. for photovoltaics plus wind energy and/uni2009//uni2009or electricity storage.\n- \u00b7 Battery storage. Demand for electricity storage is increasing as power generation shifts to wind and solar assets. RWE has been involved in the development, construction and operation of battery storage systems for many years now. For this decade, we are targeting an installed capacity of 3 GW, compared to 47 MW in late-2021. We are currently rolling out a key battery project in Hickory Park, which is located in the south of Georgia, USA. This site will be home to a 196 MW solar farm coupled to a 40 MW battery storage system. This combination will enable electricity feed-ins into the local grid to be optimised, significantly improving the solar array's yield. Future photovoltaic projects will largely follow this approach. We are also building battery storage to provide grid services. Two examples of this are the massive batteries with storage capacities of 72 MW and 45 MW, which we are currently installing at our German power plant sites in Werne and Lingen.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n- \u00b7 Flexible gas-fired power plants. The supply gap caused by the coal phaseout cannot be resolved by energy storage solutions alone. We need to build low-carbon backup capacities that can balance out the fluctuations in power generation from solar and wind. This presents growth opportunities, particularly for established power generators such as RWE. Gas-fired power plants play a key role in this regard. With an installed capacity of 14.1 GW, our fleet of gas-fired stations is the second largest in Europe, and we want to build another 2 GW of capacity by 2030. We see a need for investment in Germany in particular, where the coal exit is coinciding with the nuclear phaseout. Nevertheless, the construction of new assets in Germany involves a high degree of political and economic uncertainty, unless the plants receive guaranteed remuneration based on the Combined Heat and Power Act or via capacity auctions held by the grid operator. In one such auction, we won the right to construct a 300 MW grid stabilisation unit at our Biblis site, which is scheduled to start operation in 2022.\n\nThe Institute of Energy Economics at the University of Cologne (EWI) estimates that Germany needs to add gas-fired plants with a total capacity of 23 GW by 2030 if the country is set on phasing out coal over that same period. We are prepared to play our part. Not only does RWE have the necessary expertise, it also has a number of favourably situated sites. That said, we can only make these investments if the necessary incentives are provided for, which could include capacity payments for example. New assets would then receive remuneration for being online and thus ensuring security of supply. This would ensure economic viability even with low capacity utilisation. Furthermore, conditions must be in place for us to operate our gas-fired power stations using green hydrogen over the longer term. We are planning the necessary retrofits for our existing gas-fired assets and have already finalised the relevant strategies. Power plants that do not run on hydrogen, could separate CO 2 from the flue gas and store it underground. For political reasons, however, this option can only be considered outside Germany for the time being.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nStrategy\n\n- \u00b7 Hydrogen. The hydrogen economy is a crucial part of the energy transition and a perfect complement to our business model. We want to be active along the entire value chain, from green electricity generation and hydrogen production by electrolysis to hydrogen trading and storage and the conclusion of individual supply agreements with major industrial customers. Our regional focus in these activities is on Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. In recent years, we have forged a range of partnerships with businesses and research institutes seeking to work closely with us to develop a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure. Noteworthy projects include the German initiatives GET H2 and AquaVentus, the Dutch projects Eemshydrogen and NortH2 and our partnership with Shell, which was formed at the end of 2021. At present, we are participating in around 30 hydrogen projects. By 2030, we intend on developing electrolysis capacities totalling 2 GW. We are designing facilities that allow for industrialscale production. Examples of this include the three electrolysers slated to start production at the Lingen power station in the period from 2024 to 2026. With capacities of 100 MW each, these units will be among the largest of their kind in Europe. More information on our hydrogen strategy and our major projects can be found at www.rwe.com/hydrogen.\n\nEnergy trading and customer solutions. In addition to power generation, we are also focused on energy trading as one of our core competencies. It is managed by the Group company RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading, which acts as our window into the energy markets. Around 200 RWE specialists trade electricity, fuel and emission rights around the clock. RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading also markets the electricity from our power stations and procures the fuel and emission allowances required to produce it. The objective here is to limit price risks. On top of that, the company is in charge of the commercial optimisation of our power plant dispatch, the earnings of which go to our generation companies. Companies outside of the RWE Group can also benefit from the expertise of our trading subsidiary. They are offered a wide range of products and services, running the gamut from traditional energy supply contracts and comprehensive energy management solutions to sophisticated risk management concepts.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nAbove and beyond this, RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading has established itself as an intermediary for pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Thus, in addition to meeting the needs of our Group companies, it also serves numerous industrial customers around the world. To this end, it enters into long-term supply agreements with producers, organises gas transportation by booking pipelines or LNG tankers and optimises the timing of deliveries using leased gas storage facilities. In this regard, the greater the size and diversification of the procurement and supply portfolios, the better the chances to commercially optimise them. The gas business also opens up opportunities for activities in the field of hydrogen. One example in this regard is the long-term partnership between RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading and Australian LNG producer Woodside. We intend to purchase liquefied natural gas from Woodside as of 2025 and collaborate on investigating the potential to market hydrogen to RWE's customer base in Asia and Europe. Another example that relates to the development of the hydrogen economy is the planned Brunsb\u00fcttel LNG terminal near Hamburg, which RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading is helping to realise. In future, green ammonia could also be imported to Germany via the terminal and converted into hydrogen in the port area.\n\n## Socially-acceptable phaseout of coal-fired generation. Our growth programme is\n\nflanked by a rapid coal exit. In the United Kingdom and Germany, we already phased out hard-coal-fired power generation in 2019 and 2021, respectively. We are currently only using hard coal in our Dutch stations Amer 9 and Eemshaven, where biomass is co-fired. From 2025 and 2030, respectively, we will no longer be using hard coal in these plants. For RWE, the phaseout of lignite, which is produced and turned into electricity in the Rhenish mining region to the west of Cologne, is much more complex and difficult in terms of the social ramifications. In early 2022, we still operated lignite-fired power stations with a total capacity of 7.6 GW, a third less than in 2015. This year, we will also be shutting down another 1.6 GW of capacity. Pursuant to current legislation, the last unit will go offline in 2038. However, the new German government has already announced that they are looking to accelerate the phaseout of coal in Germany and are working towards a deadline of 2030.",

If it were possible to provide for the necessary framework conditions in pursuit of accelerating the coal exit, we would be able to progress more quickly on our path of reducing emissions. At the same time, this would also be associated with significant additional financial burdens for us. The present legal phaseout roadmap already presents us with tremendous challenges - from operational, financial and social standpoints. At the end of 2019, before the Coal Phaseout Act entered into force, some 10,000 people were employed in the Rhenish mining region; in 2030 less than 4,000 will work there. Although the personnel affected by job losses will receive state support, such as an adjustment allowance, we will also pay for redundancy measures ourselves. In August 2020, we concluded the 'Coal Exit' tariff agreement with ver.di, Germany's United Services Trade Union, and IG BCE, the country's Industrial Mining, Chemicals and Energy Trade Union. It defines what benefits RWE will provide above and beyond the state-guaranteed payments. Early retirement plans will apply to most of those affected. Younger employees will be reassigned to new positions within the Group, or - where that is not possible - will be offered severance packages.\n\nOur responsibility to the people in the Rhenish coal region does not end at the factory gates: we want to do our part to ensure that the region remains structurally resilient and integrated within the energy sector, despite the coal phaseout. By 2030, we want to invest \u20ac4 billion in renewables, gas-fired power plants and electrolysers in North Rhine-Westphalia, with no less than 500 MW of wind and solar capacities being built in the Rhenish region alone. Some recultivated land is very well suited for these plans, and three RWE wind farms are already located there. We also want to further develop our power plant sites. For example, there are plans to build an innovation, technology and commercial park in Frimmersdorf and the surrounding area. At the Weisweiler site, within the scope of an EU project, we are looking into the possibility of capturing geothermal heat, which could be fed into the district heating network of the greater Aachen area. In addition, we are researching power-to-gas technology at the Niederaussem Innovation Centre. This is where, since 2013, we have used hydrogen and carbon dioxide made by electrolysis to produce fuel and feedstock for the chemical industry for research purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNuclear power: Our focus is on safe and efficient decommissioning. Germany's phaseout of nuclear power will soon be completed. RWE's Gundremmingen C power plant and two units belonging to other companies were taken offline at the end of 2021, leaving just three regional sites to produce electricity, of which one is run by RWE. At the end of 2022, these will also cease generation. After that, our nuclear power operations will be focused exclusively on the safe and efficient decommissioning of the plants. Moreover, we are making efforts to ensure that the sites continue to be used for energy-related purposes, as illustrated by the example of the grid stabilisation unit at Biblis.\n\nRWE AG's management system. Our management system is geared towards sustainable growth that creates value and is based on RWE's strategic guidelines. To determine these guidelines, we analyse the market environment and competitiveness of our segment activities, identify growth potential and weigh up the opportunities and risks involved. Which projects are ultimately realised is at the discretion of the management of the Group company concerned. Larger investments are approved by the Executive Board of RWE AG. It also determines the allocation of capital, the long-term portfolio development and the type of financing.\n\nTo operationally manage the Group's activities, RWE AG deploys a groupwide planning and controlling system, which ensures that resources are used efficiently, and provides timely, detailed insight into the current and prospective development of the company's assets, financial position and net earnings. Based on the targets set by the Executive Board and management's expectations regarding the development of the business, once a year we formulate our medium-term and long-term plans, in which we forecast the development of key financial indicators. The medium-term plan contains the budget figures for the following fiscal year and planned figures for the two years thereafter. The Executive Board submits the plan to the Supervisory Board, which reviews and approves it. During the respective current fiscal year, we produce internal forecasts based on the budget. Members of the Executive Board of RWE AG and the main operating companies meet regularly to analyse the interim and annual financial statements and update the forecasts. In the event that the forecast figures deviate significantly from the budget figures during a fiscal year, we analyse the underlying reasons and take countermeasures if necessary. We also immediately notify the capital market if published forecasts need to be modified.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nStrategy\n\nKey earnings indicators. Among other things, we use key earnings indicators such as EBITDA, EBIT and net income to manage our business; however, we adjust these indicators by removing special items. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation. In order to improve its explanatory power in relation to the development of ordinary activities, we remove non-operating or aperiodic effects and present these in the non-operating result. This applies to capital gains or losses, temporary effects from the fair valuation of derivatives, goodwill impairments and other material special items. Subtracting operating depreciation and amortisation from adjusted EBITDA yields adjusted EBIT. Adjusted net income is another key operating indicator for us. We calculate it by correcting net income to exclude the non-operating result, and material special items in the financial result. Instead of the actual tax rate, which reflects one-off effects, we apply the budgeted rates of 15/uni2009% (until 2022) and 20/uni2009% (from 2023), which we have derived in consideration of the earnings in our core markets, the tax rates applicable there and the utilisation of loss carryforwards.\n\nExpected minimum return on investments. We primarily use the internal rate of return (IRR) to evaluate the attractiveness of investment projects. We only undertake projects if - at the time of the investment decision - the expected IRR stays within a defined minimum threshold, which is determined on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC is augmented with project-specific risk premiums, which usually range from 100 to 300 basis points, depending on the technology or region. Using this approach, we have set lower limits which vary from 5/uni2009% to 9/uni2009% for offshore wind projects. Minimum returns of 4/uni2009% to 7/uni2009% are applied to projects involving the construction of onshore wind farms, solar assets or batteries in Europe or the USA. The thresholds for new gas-fired power plants or hydrogen activities are set between 6/uni2009% and 11/uni2009%.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nSafeguarding our financial strength and creditworthiness. The RWE Group's financial position is analysed using cash flows from operating activities, amongst other things. We also attach special importance to the development of free cash flow, which is derived by deducting capital expenditure from cash flows from operating activities and adding proceeds from divestments and asset disposals. Net debt is another indicator of RWE's financial strength: it is calculated by adding provisions for pensions and similar obligations, for the dismantling of wind farms and for nuclear waste management to RWE's net financial position. Conversely, mining provisions, our 15/uni2009% stake in E.ON and compensation for the German lignite exit, as confirmed by the German government, are disregarded.\n\nIn managing our indebtedness, we orientate ourselves towards the leverage factor, i./uni2009e. the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA in our core business. Given that we recorded positive net assets rather than net debt as of 31 December 2021, the leverage factor was below zero. For the coming years, we expect net debt to trend upward, as we will partially finance our growth investments with debt capital. Over the medium term, however the leverage factor should not exceed 3.0, as we wish to maintain our financial flexibility. For the period after 2025 we believe that an upper limit of 3.5 is reasonable, as the expansion of renewables will enhance our financial stability and our political risk exposure will decline with the gradual phaseout of coal-based power generation.\n\nAttractive dividend of at least \u20ac0.90 per share. Despite the significant funds needed for capital expenditure, RWE will remain an attractive dividend stock in the future. We will propose a dividend of \u20ac0.90 per share to the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022 for fiscal 2021. This will also constitute the minimum payout for the coming years. Over the long term, we plan to distribute 50/uni2009% to 60/uni2009% of adjusted net income to our shareholders.",

It is also the degree of innovation deployed to fuel these strategies that is decisive. Whether it's expanding renewable energy capacities, transitioning to a hydrogen economy or opting for environmentally friendly carbon recycling methods, technical challenges lurk behind every turn, waiting for solutions to address them. In 2021, RWE worked on close to 200 research and development projects in collaboration with partners from industry and science. All these projects share one common goal: to overcome hurdles on the road to an environmentally friendly, stable and sustainable energy world.\n\nSolutions for a sustainable energy system. RWE is innovative in many ways. We are motivated both by a desire to remain competitive in an ever-changing environment as well as a passion to be a driving force of this change. Our innovation projects are dedicated to developing solutions that help us advance the utilisation of renewable energy, expand electricity storage and become involved in large-scale hydrogen production. We also want to help build a circular economy in which sensible use is made of carbon dioxide.\n\nOur more than 964 patents and patent applications, based on about 241 inventions, speak volumes about RWE's capability for innovation. The Group's various activities in the field of research and development (R/uni2009&/uni2009D) are also testimony for this expertise. Last year, we worked on 196 R/uni2009&/uni2009D projects. Around 400 RWE employees were solely dedicated to these activities or contributed to them in addition to performing their normal tasks. Such ventures often entail working with other companies or research institutions and we could not implement many of these projects without their valuable insights. These collaborations are also financially advantageous, as costs are shouldered by many stakeholders. This limits operating R/uni2009&/uni2009D spending, which in 2021 amounted to \u20ac22 million (previous year: \u20ac20 million).\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nOn the following pages, we present a small selection of our current innovation projects. They illustrate the breadth and variety of the challenges we face in light of the energy transition and demonstrate the creativity with which we are tackling these issues.\n\nHow we are using new technologies for offshore wind expansion. There are currently 170 offshore wind farms operating around the world. All are located in shallow coastal waters with turbines firmly anchored to the seabed. Coastal regions with greater water depths have - until recently - been off-limits to offshore wind farms. After all, the deeper the water, the more expensive the foundation. Wind power projects generally become uneconomical at depths of over 60 metres. According to WindEurope, the European wind industry association, in about 80/uni2009% of all coastal sea areas where wind speeds are suitable for electricity generation, the ocean is simply too deep for conventional foundation designs. However, in order to harness the potential of wind energy more effectively, companies are turning their efforts to concepts for floating wind turbines. The units are mounted on floating platforms made of steel or concrete, which are secured to the seabed using mooring lines and anchors. This opens up the possibility of deploying wind turbines in deeper waters, e./uni2009g. coastal areas in Asia, the Americas and the Mediterranean region as well as in parts of the North Sea. RWE has taken a leading role in the development of these new foundations. We are currently involved in three demonstration projects, researching the pros and cons of the various floating foundations. Our aim is to identify which technology is the most viable for the respective wind power initiative.\n\nThe DemoSATH project is a partnership with Spanish company Saitec Offshore Technologies that aims to develop and construct a floating platform for a 2 MW wind turbine. The project relies on Saitec's SATH (swinging around twin hull) technology, which is a catamaran-like floating platform made of tensioned concrete elements. This design allows the floating platform to rotate freely around a single point of mooring, depending on wind",

We have commissioned a prototype, DemoSATH, which will be assembled on a quayside in the port of Bilbao, in northern Spain. Once complete, tugs will move the floating wind turbine to a mooring point three kilometres from the Basque coast, where it will start generating electricity before the end of the year.\n\nThe New England Aqua Ventus project is a collaboration with the University of Maine and Diamond Offshore Wind, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation. The unit will feature a technology developed by the University of Maine, where the floating platform consists of modular concrete components with glued joints - a construction technique seen in bridges. We aim to have built an 11 MW prototype by 2024, which will be deployed in the Gulf of Maine on the eastern coast of the USA. This testing process will provide us with valuable technical learnings, as well as helping us to understand how best to limit potential for friction between the plant and local fisheries.\n\nTetraSpar Demonstrator is our most advanced project. It is a collaboration with Shell, Japanese utility TEPCO and Danish company Stiesdal Offshore Technologies, and involves a floating platform comprising two sections that are cost-effectively prefabricated across various locations. A keel below the platform is used to keep the steel top section stable in the water - similar to a ship. We assembled the sections in the Port of Grenaa in Denmark. A 3.6 MW wind turbine was then mounted on the floating platform. In summer 2021, we towed the structure to a test site 10 kilometres off the Norwegian coast, near Stavanger. Once on site, it was attached to the seabed 200 metres below using mooring lines and anchor chains, before being connected to the Norwegian power grid. The floating turbine has been operating since November. We have fitted a number of sensors to measure whether real-life performance matches up to forecasts created using calculations and tests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nHow we are improving the sustainability of wind power facilities. In essence, a wind turbine consists of a tower, a nacelle and three rotor blades. To ensure it doesn't just produce green electricity but is also entirely environmentally friendly, a turbine should be completely recyclable once it reaches the end of its service life. Although tried-and-tested recycling methods for the tower and components of the nacelle already exist, it's a different story when it comes to the rotor blades. These components are made using composite materials that are almost impossible to separate, due to the glass fibre-reinforced epoxy resin that becomes completely solid once hardened. In a ground-breaking project, we are now helping to identify end-to-end recycling solutions at our Kaskasi wind farm, off the coast of Heligoland. A number of the 38 wind turbines being erected there this year will be fitted with special recyclable rotor blades. Our supplier Siemens Gamesa is manufacturing them using a new type of resin with a chemical structure that allows for the different materials to be separated, preserving their properties. This makes it possible to reuse the individual components once the rotor blade has reached the end of its lifetime. We will test these sustainable rotor blades in real-life settings over the coming years. Should they prove effective, then resin solutions of this nature could become standard for future RWE wind farms.\n\nHow we are forging ahead with green hydrogen production. Zero-carbon hydrogen has the potential to be used for multiple processes within the context of the energy transition. Not only is it suitable for storing electricity, it could also be used to decarbonise industrial processes and modes of transport that either cannot be electrified or where electrification has proven to be prohibitively expensive or arduous. Most of our hydrogen projects focus on decarbonising industrial applications. RWE is working with partners on around 30 such initiatives with a geographical focus on Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Several have a good chance of being classified as 'Important Projects of Common European Interest' (IPCEI) by the EU. This means they would qualify for national subsidies. Our HyTechHafen Rostock project as well as parts of the GET H2 and AquaVentus collaborative initiatives backed by RWE all made it onto the shortlist of the Federal Ministry of Economics. In the following pages, we will take a closer look at the undertakings.",

A host of companies and scientific institutions including RWE, BASF, BP, Evonik, Nowega, OGE and ThyssenGas are participating in the project. GET H2 spans the entire hydrogen value chain, from production and transport to industrial usage. The long-term objective is to build a nationwide hydrogen infrastructure in Germany. As part of the initiative, we joined forces with four partners at our Lingen power plant in 2020 to launch the GET H2 Nukleus project. By 2026, three electrolysis plants are to be built on site, each with a capacity of 100 MW. The aim is to use electrolysis technology on a larger scale to bring it to series production and unlock cost cutting potential. The green hydrogen produced in Lingen will be transported using repurposed natural gas pipelines to the northern Ruhr region, where it will be used in the BP refinery in Gelsenkirchen. This would form the heart of the public hydrogen infrastructure. The IPCEI funding application also envisages that the hydrogen grid be expanded towards Salzgitter, Duisburg, and the Netherlands. Furthermore, the first German H 2 cavern storage facility is expected to be connected to the hydrogen grid in Gronau-Epe.\n\nAnother initiative with substantial potential is AquaVentus . The idea behind it is to produce hydrogen at sea using electricity from offshore wind farms and transport it via pipelines to demand hotspots on land. The island of Heligoland will act as a hub. In a first step, the plan is to transport the hydrogen there via pipelines to cover demand on the island itself. Once production volumes increase, hydrogen in ever greater volumes will then be forwarded to the mainland, initially by tanker and later via a collector pipeline. Our AquaVentus partners include the island of Heligoland, Gascade, Gasunie, Shell and Siemens. A pilot project is being conducted to build two 14 MW wind turbines in the coastal waters of Heligoland and integrate an electrolyser in each of their bases. If the project stays on schedule, the turbines could become operational in 2026. But this is only the beginning. By 2035, electrolysers with a total capacity of 10 GW could be installed in the North Sea. This would be enough to produce up to 1 million metric tons of green hydrogen every year.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nOur HyTechHafen Rostock project is dedicated to harnessing the potentials of the port of Rostock as a promising location for the hydrogen economy, not least due to its industrial infrastructure. Together with our partners, port operator Rostock Port and energy providers RheinEnergie and EnBW, we will initially focus on constructing 100 MW of electrolysis capacity. The unit will be built next to a power plant operated by RheinEnergie and EnBW in the vicinity of the port and the green hydrogen generated on site will be delivered to local industrial customers via pipelines. Going forward, the infrastructure could also be used for road, rail and sea traffic. If the project stays on schedule and the framework is suitable, the port area could one day boast up to 1 GW of electrolysis capacity, as the site grows to become a hydrogen hub.\n\nHow we are preparing to generate electricity with green hydrogen. The more we rely on wind and solar power for our electricity supply, the more crucial it will be to have ample energy storage facilities to ensure a reliable, weather-independent supply of electricity that satisfies demand. Battery-based solutions and green hydrogen for electricity generation are promising concepts. This is why we want to build flexible gas-fired power stations with a total capacity of 2 GW as part of our 'Growing Green' strategy. In the long-term, the plants will run on green hydrogen, once supplies are sufficient. To improve the technical conditions for this, we have joined forces with one of the world's leading turbine manufacturers, Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The aim of this partnership is to trial a hydrogen-capable gas turbine. It is due to be built at our Lingen power plant, have a capacity of 34 MW and become operational in 2024. The turbine will be the largest gas turbine in the world that can be operated using 100/uni2009% H 2 . It would also be possible to use the turbine to co-fire natural gas and hydrogen in any desired ratio. This flexibility is a massive plus, for as long as the hydrogen industry is in its infancy, the average available volume of H 2 will probably not suffice to exploit the turbine's capacity to the desired extent.",

Many experts believe that human intervention in the climate can only be limited effectively if the global economic system successfully makes the shift to closed carbon cycles. Ideally, only as much carbon enters the atmosphere, by way of greenhouse gas emissions such as CO 2 or methane, as is bound by other processes at the same time. The transition to a circular carbon economy is a Herculean task, that hinges on innovation. For more than ten years now, RWE has been developing techniques that use CO 2 in an ecologically meaningful way. Within the context of this work, we collaborate with universities and research institutes, with whom we seek to contribute to the creation of the necessary technical and systemic conditions for carbonneutral economic cycles.\n\nA key process in transitioning to the circular carbon economy is thermal conversion. Here, heat is applied to carbonaceous materials, converting them into synthesis gas, which largely consists of hydrogen and carbon and can be used as a basic raw material in the production of fuels, plastics and fine chemicals. At the RWE Niederaussem Innovation Centre, we are dedicated to developing a high-temperature process to thermally convert different materials, and thus reuse basic resources in manufacturing. We have partnered with the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, Safety and Energy Technology (Fraunhofer UMSICHT) and Bochum Ruhr University for this purpose.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nIn mid-2021, we took a multi-fuel-conversion plant online in Niederaussem, which we intend to use to test whether phosphorus can be reclaimed from sewage sludge using high-temperature conversion. The process works as follows: by heating the sewage sludge to up to 1,500 degrees Celsius, we achieve gasification of the phosphorus, hydrogen and carbon contained therein. The phosphorus can then be separated from this gas and used to produce fertiliser, for example. Additional process steps can then be taken to convert the remaining gas mixture of hydrogen and carbon back into chemical raw materials or fuels. We should have the first test results back by late-2022. However, the potential of the multi-fuel-conversion technology is by no means likely to be exhausted. In future, we also want to apply this technology to other waste streams and biomass.\n\nAnother project dedicated to the use of carbonaceous waste materials launched in June 2021. The NRW-Revier-Power-to-BioJetFuel study we are conducting together with BP Europe and the J\u00fclich Research Centre is assessing the prerequisites for manufacturing carbon-neutral aviation fuel on an industrial scale. This research focuses on questions such as: 'What kind of regulatory framework is necessary to ensure the economic viability of plans to operate a demonstration plant for deriving synthetic fuels from alternative carbon sources (e./uni2009g. sewage sludge, biomass or power plant flue gas) at an RWE site in the Rhenish region?' We are also determining to what extent the resulting fuels could be further processed and used for industry in the Ruhr region. If the results are promising, project development for the construction of a demonstration plant could start as early as this year.",

Last year, the EU upped its greenhouse gas reduction goal for 2030 from 40/uni2009% to 55/uni2009%. The baseline year is 1990. Germany has set its sights even higher: the largest economy in Europe has increased its target from 55/uni2009% to 65/uni2009%. We welcome this change, as it encourages the rapid expansion of renewable energy. The economic environment also presents us with opportunities. Soaring natural gas and emission allowance prices have caused prices on electricity markets to skyrocket. This favours climate-friendly generation assets in particular. Given that most of our power production had already been sold forward, the increased price levels had little impact on our earnings in 2021. In 2022, however, we expect margins to improve notably.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\n## Emission reduction target for 2030: EU adopts stricter benchmark of 55/uni2009%. The\n\nEuropean climate law came into force on 29 July 2021, under which the EU and its member states are obligated to decrease their net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. There had been some initial disagreement, in particular with regard to the emission reduction goal for 2030. The Commission had suggested an increase from 40/uni2009% to 55/uni2009% versus 1990. The European Council (Council of Ministers) had also voted in favour of this change, while the European Parliament had backed a reduction of as much as 60/uni2009%. Following a number of trilateral meetings, representatives of the individual institutions ultimately agreed on 55/uni2009%. They also approved the formation of a panel known as the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change. The 15 senior scientific experts on this advisory board will be responsible for delivering a greenhouse gas budget, which can be used to determine an intermediate target for 2040.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nThe European Commission specified the instruments that would be necessary to achieve its new climate protection target for 2030 in the 'Fit for 55' legislative package. The package was made public on 14 July 2021, and includes proposals for a number of measures that will, for example, improve energy efficiency, cut carbon emissions in transport, construction and agriculture, bring the taxation of energy products in line with current objectives, expand natural carbon sinks and cushion the social implications of climate protection. Renewables are due to be scaled up rapidly and should cover at least 40/uni2009% of primary energy consumption in the EU by 2030. A goal which, until now, had been set at 32/uni2009%. Furthermore, the Commission wants to adapt the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The aim here is to decrease the total number of emission allowances placed on the market. At present, companies in the energy, industry and aviation sectors are participating in the ETS. In future, there is likely to be a similar system for heating and all other transport. In addition, the Commission plans to introduce a carbon border adjustment mechanism to ensure products manufactured in the EU are not subjected to higher carbon prices than imports. This is to prevent domestic companies suffering a competitive disadvantage and thus relocating their production sites to countries outside the EU. The 'Fit for 55' package is being debated by member states and in the European Parliament. Draft laws have already been submitted for most of the legislative initiatives. However, Parliament and the Council of Ministers are expected to go through a lengthy process to establish their positions and reach an agreement.\n\n## EU taxonomy: Commission defines conditions for 'green' economic activity. In a\n\ndelegated act published in mid-2021, the European Commission defined technical screening criteria to determine whether economic activity is mitigating or adapting to climate change. Most renewable energy assets are likely to meet the criteria. The act formalises the provisions of the Taxonomy Regulation, introduced by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in mid-2020. The Regulation is designed as a tool to help determine when to classify economic activity as sustainable. The EU is taking this stance to improve transparency for investors and channel capital flows into environmentally friendly activities.",

        "page_content": "2\n\n## Combined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nBusiness environment\n\nTo be recognised as taxonomy-aligned, an economic activity must contribute to at least one of the following environmental objectives, without significantly harming any of the others: (1) climate change mitigation, (2) climate change adaptation, (3) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (4) transition to a circular economy, (5) pollution prevention and control and (6) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. The Commission's first delegated act was concerned with defining the criteria for the first two objectives, with the remaining targets to be delivered over the course of the coming year.\n\nIn February 2022, the Commission passed a supplementary delegated act which formalises the taxonomy criteria for new gas and nuclear power stations. It states that gas-fired power plants which are approved before 2030, can be classed as sustainable even if they exceed the upper emissions limit of 100 g CO 2 /uni2009//uni2009kWh, provided they replace more carbon-intensive assets and are fully operated using climate-friendly gases like hydrogen no later than 2036. There will also be a cap on CO 2 emissions. The act mentions two upper limits, of which one has to be complied with, namely 270 g CO 2 /uni2009//uni2009kWh or - alternatively - 550 kg CO 2 /uni2009//uni2009kW as an annual average over a period of 20 years. The standards imposed are ambitious, but can be met given the right framework conditions. These include the rapid expansion of hydrogen infrastructure. The delegated act does not require formal approval from the European Parliament or Council of Ministers. However, both authorities have veto powers: they can reject an act entirely within six months of its passage by the Commission.\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation has also introduced new transparency obligations. Players on the financial market, e./uni2009g. investment funds that label a financial product as environmentally sustainable, now have to disclose the share of green assets in their portfolio. Listed companies will also have to observe stricter disclosure requirements. Under the new requirements, businesses that are already obliged to prepare non-financial reports will now have to disclose what percentage of their capital expenditure, revenue and operational expenditure are classed as sustainable in accordance with EU taxonomy regulations. This obligation applies to all annual reports published on or after 1 January 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nIn the first year of reporting, companies are allowed to follow a simplified process, whereby disclosure is limited to whether taxonomy criteria exist for a given economic activity and not whether the applicable conditions for said activity have been met. Activities for which taxonomy criteria exist are classed as 'taxonomy-eligible'. Up to 88/uni2009% of our capital expenditure in 2021 met this requirement. It should be noted that taxonomy-relevant capital expenditure (\u20ac6.0 billion) is not defined in the same way as the figure shown on pages 58 et seq. (\u20ac3.8 billion) and also cover, for example, additions from mergers of companies. In the past year, 18/uni2009% of revenue (\u20ac24.5 billion) was taxonomy-eligible along with 25/uni2009% of operational expenditure (\u20ac1.6 billion). From 1 January 2023, we will report what percentage of our economic activities actually meet the technical screening criteria and is thus considered 'taxonomy-aligned'. We have set ourselves the target of ensuring that more than 90/uni2009% of our investments are dedicated to such activities in future.\n\n## New climate law: Germany seeks to become carbon neutral by 2045. On 24 June 2021,\n\nthe German Upper House passed a reform of the climate law, imposing a stricter greenhouse gas reduction target, which was greenlit by the Lower House one day later. Germany has now set its sights firmly on being carbon neutral by 2045 - five years ahead of the climate law's original schedule, drawn up in 2019. By 2030, greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by 65/uni2009% compared to 1990. The original target was 55/uni2009%. It is also the first time that an emission reduction target for 2040 has been set: it amounts to 88/uni2009%. The law also specifies targets for individual sectors, with the energy industry shouldering the majority of additional emissions cuts: in 2030, the sector is limited to emitting 108 million metric tons of carbon. The original emissions threshold had been set at 175 million metric tons.\n\nThese legislative amendments were seen as a reaction to a decision handed down by the German Constitutional Court and published in April 2021. The judges in Karlsruhe had found the Climate Protection Act of 2019 to be insufficient and had called for more concrete regulations for the period after 2030. They highlighted the enormous burden that irreversibly delaying considerable emission reductions would place on future generations.",

        "page_content": "2\n\n## Combined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nBusiness environment\n\nHow exactly these additional emission reductions will be achieved is now down to the new government coalition between Germany's Social Democrats, Greens and Free Democrats. A range of measures have already been announced, such as further expediting the phaseout of coal, which is ideally to be achieved by 2030. The German government is also looking to move up a gear in other areas, including expanding renewable capacities and scaling up the hydrogen economy.\n\n## Germany imposes stricter emissions limits for air pollutants. At the eleventh hour,\n\nGermany transposed the new EU requirements for limiting air pollutant emissions from power plants into national law. Midway through 2021, an amendment to the 13 th German Emission Control Act and new co-firing requirements in the 17 th German Emission Control Act entered into force, introducing more stringent limits on nitrogen oxides and mercury, in particular. To ensure compliance, we have optimised the nitrogen oxide reduction processes in all our lignite-fired power plants and equipped our three most state-of-the-art units with additional mercury removal systems. Gas-fired stations are also affected by the stricter regulations. Existing plants and those under construction are marginally compliant with the current nitrogen oxide thresholds, without having to rely on retrofits. However, future power stations must be fitted with catalytic exhaust gas purification systems, which will increase costs significantly.\n\n## German government establishes new system for nuclear phaseout compensation.\n\nThe 18 th Amendment to the German Nuclear Energy Act entered into force on 31 October 2021. It governs remuneration for German nuclear power plant operators impacted by the accelerated nuclear phaseout. RWE was entitled to \u20ac880 million in compensation. We received the funds at the end of November. It had been necessary to readdress the issue of remuneration in light of the German Constitutional Court's findings that the regulations drawn up in 2018 had never entered into force and were, moreover, unconstitutional. We provided additional context on this matter on page 39 of the 2020 Annual Report. The new law is flanked by an associated public-law contract between the Federal Republic of Germany and the power plant operators, which was signed by the contracting parties in March 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## United Kingdom launches national emissions trading system. The new British trading\n\nsystem for carbon emission allowances entered into force in early 2021. On 19 May, the first 6.1 million certificates (UK Allowances, or UKAs for short) were auctioned off, each entitling the holder to emit one metric ton of carbon. At \u00a344 (\u20ac51), the price was twice as high as the lower regulatory limit. Additional auctions followed every two weeks. In 2021, around 83 million emission allowances were auctioned off in total, and around 38 million were allocated free of charge. The UK sought to establish its own emissions trading system as a result of leaving the EU. Britain has not participated in European emissions trading since the end of 2020. Until now, both systems have been kept strictly separate, i./uni2009e. it has not been possible to use EU Allowances (EUAs) in the UK nor has using UKAs been permissible in the EU. This can give rise to price discrepancies (see page 38). In addition to a number of renewable energy assets, our UK power generation portfolio includes ten gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 7 GW. The carbon emitted by these facilities amounted to 12.8 million metric tons in 2021.\n\nNetherlands limits use of coal in power plants. The Dutch parliament and senate have passed an amendment to the country's legislation on the Coal Phaseout Act, which places additional restrictions on the use of coal for electricity generation. Under the new law, annual CO 2 emissions from coal use may in future not exceed 35/uni2009% of the level that is theoretically possible in the respective plant. The regulation will apply from 2022 to 2024. Plant operators are to be compensated, however this is yet to be approved under state aid law by the EU Commission. RWE operates two hard coal power plants in the Netherlands, Amer 9 and Eemshaven. Amer 9 runs on 80/uni2009% biomass and is therefore not affected by the upper limit. Eemshaven, on the other hand, will be severely impacted by the law as it only uses 15/uni2009% biomass.",

The Polish government has finalised the legal framework for offshore wind farm subsidies, with the Polish parliament passing a corresponding law in January 2021. Poland intends to increase the share of renewables in its power generation portfolio to 32/uni2009% in 2030; in 2020 this figure stood at 16/uni2009%. At the moment, there are no wind farms off the coast of Poland. However, turbines with a total capacity of 10.9 GW should be in development, under construction or in operation by as early as 2027. Wind farms with a total capacity of 5.9 GW will be able to take part in the first round of subsidies. Plant operators will be awarded contracts for difference which guarantee a fixed payment for 100,000 full load hours. The maximum subsidy period is set at 25 years. RWE succeeded in securing a contract of this nature for its F./uni2009E./uni2009W. Baltic II project, on which we report in detail on page 41.\n\nThe US government plans to extend tax benefits for renewables. Shortly after his inauguration, US president Joe Biden presented an ambitious investment package to subsidise infrastructure, social care and climate protection initiatives, which envisages an extension to renewables tax benefits. New power stations are to continue to receive Production Tax Credits (PTCs) or Investment Tax Credits (ITCs). The aim is to grant PTCs in the amount of US$25 per MWh for a period of ten years, while ITCs are to account for up to 30/uni2009% of the investment costs. In future, it should be possible to subsidise hydrogen and electricity storage projects in addition to wind power and solar systems.\n\nBefore it is enshrined in law, the investment package must first pass through the Senate and the House of Representatives. The Democrats hold the necessary majorities in both houses. In November, the House of Representatives greenlit the proposal. One single Democratic senator, however, has so far prevented it from passing through the Senate. Points of contention include the overall cost of the package and individual social measures. Commentators expect a new package to be tabled, which includes tax incentives for investing in climate protection and is capable of achieving a majority in both houses. However, time is of the essence here given the pending Senate elections in November 2022. Should the Democrats lose their narrow majority, then the Republicans could block legislative proposals from the US government.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Market environment\n\nStrong economic output in all of RWE's core markets. In 2021, global output made a strong recovery, following the economic downturn witnessed during the pandemic. Initial estimates put increased economic performance at 6/uni2009% year on year. While the USA saw a similar level of growth, the Eurozone fell behind by approximately one percentage point. In Germany and the Netherlands, our two most important markets within the currency union, current data suggests a rise of 3/uni2009% and 5/uni2009%, respectively. The UK economy is centred around the service industry and was therefore hit much harder by the pandemic. However, figures suggest the nation's economy could have since rebounded by 7/uni2009%. The global economic recovery was reflected in the significant rise in demand for commodities, which led to a notable increase in prices. There were also supply shortages and project delays, which have only affected RWE to a minimal extent so far.\n\nGerman power consumption up by 3/uni2009% versus prior year. In the past year, demand for electricity has risen across all RWE markets. This was largely attributable to the economic upswing. Preliminary data from the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW) indicates that German electricity consumption was up 3/uni2009% on 2020. For the USA, experts estimate a rise of similar proportions, while the Netherlands (1/uni2009%) and the UK (2/uni2009%), will most likely have fallen short of this mark.\n\nLow wind speeds across the majority of RWE locations. Utilisation and profitability of renewables assets are largely weather-dependent. This is why we monitor wind speeds carefully. In 2021, these were lower than the long-term average across most of our production sites in Europe and North America. A year-on-year comparison also revealed an unfavourable development: most RWE wind farms were underutilised versus 2020 due to weather conditions. Only pockets of southern Europe were able to benefit from higher wind volumes. The utilisation of run-of-river power stations depends on precipitation and melt water volumes. In Germany, where most of the RWE Group's hydroelectric plants are located, these volumes were a little below the long-term average. They were, however, higher than in 2020.",

The utilisation and earnings of our conventional power plants are heavily dependent on how electricity, fuel and emission allowance markets perform. Natural gas, our most important energy source for producing electricity, became increasingly expensive in the year under review. In the first quarter of 2021, quotations at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF), Continental Europe's lead market, were still largely priced between \u20ac15/uni2009//uni2009MWh and \u20ac20/uni2009//uni2009MWh, but by the fourth quarter they intermittently exceeded levels far above \u20ac100. In 2021, the average spot price of \u20ac48/uni2009//uni2009MWh was more than five times as high as in 2020 (\u20ac9/uni2009//uni2009MWh). This drastic price hike for natural gas is partially attributable to increased demand for energy due to the global economic upturn. In addition, colder weather across large parts of Europe meant that more gas was needed for heating compared to 2020. Geopolitical tensions and uncertainty surrounding the approval of the Russian-German Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline contributed to the price increase. Due to the aforementioned factors, forward quotations rose considerably. The 2022 forward hit a record high of well above \u20ac100/uni2009//uni2009MWh in December. On average, it was quoted at \u20ac34/uni2009//uni2009MWh. By way of comparison, in the previous year the 2021 TTF forward cost \u20ac13/uni2009//uni2009MWh on average.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nIncreased demand from China boosts hard coal prices. Prices for hard coal used in power plants (steam coal) also rose notably in the year under review. Deliveries to ARA ports (ARA/uni2009=/uni2009Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp) including freight and insurance were settled for an average of US$122/uni2009//uni2009metric ton (\u20ac104) in 2021, as opposed to US$50/uni2009//uni2009metric ton the previous year. This notable rise can, in part, be traced back to increased demand from China, where the local economy recovered quickly from the economic fallout of the pandemic. The same trend was also reflected in the development of hard coal forward prices: in the year under review, the 2022 forward (API 2 Index) was quoted at an average of US$95/uni2009//uni2009metric ton (\u20ac81). This is US$37 more than was paid for the 2021 forward in 2020.\n\n## CO 2 emissions trading: More ambitious EU climate protection target pushes prices up.\n\nAn increasingly important price factor for fossil fuel-fired power plants is the procurement of CO 2 emission allowances. An EU Allowance (EUA), entitling the holder to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide, was traded at an average of \u20ac54 in 2021 - almost twice the price in 2020. This figure is based on contracts for delivery that mature in December of the following year. Once the EUA price curve had exceeded \u20ac30 in late 2020, there was only one way things could go, and that was up. As 2021 drew to a close, allowance prices were already closing in on the \u20ac80 figure. The considerable price hikes were primarily the result of the introduction of a stricter European greenhouse gas reduction target for 2030. To meet this goal, the EU needs to vastly decrease the number of emission allowances available to companies. Many market participants anticipated this, making early purchases of EUAs. The increase in energy consumption driven by the economy contributed to the rise in prices because it also drove up greenhouse gas emissions and demand for emission allowances.\n\nAs explained on page 36, the United Kingdom launched its own CO 2 emissions trading system when it left the EU. UK Allowances (UKAs) have been traded on the secondary market since the first auction in May 2021. In the seven and a half months to the end of the year, UKAs were quoted above EUAs. The average price during this time was \u00a357 (\u20ac67).",

The incredible rise in the price of fuel and emission allowances shaped the trajectory of our most important wholesale electricity markets in Europe. The low wind energy output, due to poor weather, and maintenance-related outages at French nuclear power plants also came to bear to some extent. In Germany, the average annual spot price for base-load electricity more than tripled compared to 2020, rising from \u20ac30/uni2009//uni2009MWh to \u20ac97/uni2009//uni2009MWh. The changes were on a similar scale in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, where quotations rose from \u00a335/uni2009//uni2009MWh to \u00a3118/uni2009//uni2009MWh (\u20ac138) and from \u20ac32/uni2009//uni2009MWh to \u20ac103/uni2009//uni2009MWh, respectively. Electricity forward markets also witnessed a drastic upward curve. An average of \u20ac89/uni2009//uni2009MWh was paid for the 2022 base-load forward in Germany and the Netherlands. In the preceding year, this figure stood at \u20ac40 in both countries. The price of the British one-year forward increased from \u00a344/uni2009//uni2009MWh to \u00a392/uni2009//uni2009MWh (\u20ac108).\n\n## Once-in-a-century snowstorm sees electricity spot prices in Texas hit record high. The\n\nNorth American electricity market is geographically divided into multiple sub-systems, each of which is governed by an independent system operator. The most important market region for RWE is Texas, where most of our wind farms in the USA are connected to the grid and the system operator is the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Spot prices on the ERCOT market briefly peaked at US$9,000/uni2009//uni2009MWh in February 2021 due to supply shortages and regulatory interventions. This was due to an exceptionally harsh cold spell, which led to outages at several power plants. Electricity forward prices saw no long-term effects from this event. Last year, a one-year forward contract in the ERCOT market cost on average US$37/uni2009//uni2009MWh (\u20ac31), US$7 more than in 2020. Higher natural gas prices were decisive in this regard. The more moderate electricity price level compared to Europe can be explained by the fact that gas prices in the USA remain relatively low, despite the recent hike. In addition, Texan electricity producers do not need to purchase carbon emission allowances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nHigher margins on electricity forward markets. In order to mitigate the risk of short-term sales and price fluctuations, we sell most of our electricity forward, whilst also hedging the prices for necessary fuels and emission allowances. Our revenue for the period under review was thus influenced by the conditions of forward contracts for 2021, which were concluded in previous years. These forward sales are largely conducted with a lead time of up to three years for power production in our lignite and nuclear plants, which are mainly used to cover base-load needs. On average, we were able to achieve higher prices and margins from these assets for 2021 than for 2020. Sales of electricity from our gas-fired stations were subject to a shorter lead time. Margins realised from these transactions were higher than the previous year. A portion of our renewables portfolio is also subject to forward contracts.\n\nWe do, however, still sell some of the generated power at spot market prices valid at the time of sale. The margins we achieved for these transactions were higher than in 2020. Furthermore, price spikes on the spot market contributed to additional income from the short-term optimisation of our power plant dispatch.\n\nThe rise in the price of electricity will have a more notable impact on margins in 2022. This concerns generation assets that had not yet fully or had only partially sold their electricity forward when prices began to climb. European wind farms, in particular, where electricity revenue depends on market prices, now enjoy improved earnings forecasts. However, a portion of our conventional power plant portfolio also stands to benefit from the price trend.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\nMajor events\n\n## 2.4  Major events\n\nIn 2021, we showed just how committed we are to green growth. We secured the rights to build and operate offshore wind projects in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland and Germany with a capacity of up to 5 GW. Furthermore, we forged strong partnerships for joint wind and solar activities in new markets. In the hydrogen business, we formalised a partnership with Shell, which we expect to deliver substantial synergies. RWE's green transition strategy comprises the phaseout of coal-fired power. Here too, we took massive strides in 2021 by decommissioning our two remaining German hard coal-fired power stations and five lignite units. In this chapter, we present the main events that took place in 2021 and the beginning of 2022, focusing on those which are not outlined in more detail elsewhere in the review of operations.\n\n## Events in the fiscal year\n\n## RWE wins rights to develop new offshore wind power sites in the British North Sea.\n\nAt an auction held in February 2021, RWE secured the rights to build wind turbines with a total capacity of 3,000 MW across two neighbouring locations in the UK North Sea. In return, we will pay an annual option fee of \u00a382,552/uni2009//uni2009MW (plus inflation adjustment) until we make   a final investment decision. The area is situated on a sandbank in shallow waters known as Dogger Bank. The Sofia wind farm is also being built in the vicinity. After the auction, an official plan-level Habitats Regulations Assessment (HRA) was initiated, which is expected to be finalised in 2022. Only after this is completed will the option fee period commence. In accordance with applicable regulations, however, we had to pay an annual fee in advance in 2021. As soon as all permits for the new wind farms have been obtained, we will participate in an auction for a subsidy contract, after which we  will make a final investment decision. Then the option fee will be replaced by a much lower lease payment. If connected to the grid in time, the wind farms could be commissioned as early as the end of this decade.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nThe Crown Estate's tender process allocated development rights to a total of six sites on which offshore wind farms with a total capacity of up to 7,980 MW can be built. A number of the participants, which also secured option rights, submitted significantly higher bids than us. RWE will pay the lowest average annual option fee per megawatt of all successful bidders.\n\n## Danish Energy Agency awards large offshore wind project to RWE. In Denmark, we have\n\nbeen granted the rights to build and operate the Thor offshore wind project in the North Sea. We had taken part in an auction along with five other bidders: all participants submitted minimum bids of DKK 0.1/uni2009//uni2009MWh. On 1 December 2021, we won the auction and shortly afterwards signed a concession agreement with the Danish Energy Agency, which entitles us to build the wind farm and operate it for 30 years. Thor will be constructed about 20 kilometres off the coast of west Denmark and will be the country's largest offshore wind farm to date, with a capacity of approximately 1,000 MW. It is scheduled for full commissioning in 2027. Due to our minimum bid, we will not receive state subsidies for the electricity generated by Thor. In the early years, we will have to transfer our proceeds to the Danish government until they total DKK 2.8 billion (\u20ac377 million) plus annual inflation. We expect our investment for the wind farm and the grid connection to amount to \u20ac2.1 billion. In Denmark, RWE already operates the R\u00f8dsand 2 offshore wind farm, which is located south of the island of Lolland and has an installed capacity of 207 MW.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\nMajor events\n\nRWE secures two offshore wind farm sites in the German North Sea. In Germany too, we laid the groundwork for new offshore wind farms. Last year, we secured the usage rights to two sites in the German North Sea. We were allocated one of the sites, officially referred to as N-3.7, during an auction held by the German Network Agency in September 2021. This confers us the right to build a wind farm on site with a capacity of 225 MW. To give us the best chance of winning the auction, we submitted a zero-cent bid, which means the electricity generated by the wind farm is not subject to a minimum price guaranteed by the state. We were granted usage rights to the second site, referred to as N-3.8, following the September auction, allowing us to build a wind farm with an installed capacity of 433 MW. Originally, the winning bid had been placed by French energy group EDF, but it had to pass on the usage rights to a joint venture between Northland Power and RWE. This is because we had pre-developed the site together with our Canadian partner and therefore had a step-in right. Now we must deliver the project at the conditions in EDF's winning bid; the company submitted a zero-cent bid.\n\nSupport secured for offshore wind project in Poland. We have also made good progress in relation to our first wind energy project in the Polish Baltic Sea. In April 2021, the government in Warsaw made a preliminary commitment to subsidise our F./uni2009E./uni2009W. Baltic II project. It is envisaged that the wind farm be built on the S\u0142upsk sandbank and have a capacity of 350 MW. It was not until January 2021 that the Polish government established the legal framework for subsidising offshore wind power. We were granted environmental clearance for F./uni2009E./uni2009W. Baltic II in December and will receive the final subsidy approval in 2022, at which time the regulator will also decide on the level of the funding. The support will be granted in the form of two-sided contracts for difference which guarantee that we receive a fixed price per megawatt hour for the generation volume of 100,000 full load hours. If the realised market price is lower than this amount, the state pays the difference. If it is higher, the operators are obliged to make a payment. The subsidy period is limited to 25 years.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nRWE becomes majority shareholder in Rampion offshore wind farm. As of 1 April 2021, we acquired a 20/uni2009% interest in the UK Rampion offshore wind farm from E.ON. The purchase price was paid in December 2020. As a result of the transaction, we now own 50.1/uni2009% of the 400 MW wind farm and can consolidate it fully. The other owners are a consortium led by Macquarie (25/uni2009%) and Canadian energy group Enbridge (24.9/uni2009%). Rampion is located in the English Channel off the coast of Sussex and has been operating commercially since 2018.\n\nTCP investor consortium acquires Rampion's grid connection. In November, investor consortium Transmission Capital Partners (TCP) purchased Rampion's grid connection, for which it paid a total of \u00a3279.5 million. The transaction included the offshore and onshore export cables as well as the substations at sea and on land. The sale was a regulatory requirement. In the United Kingdom, construction of offshore wind farms and the associated grid connection is managed under one umbrella. The grid connection must subsequently be sold to an independent third party under the supervision of UK regulator Ofgem.\n\nGo-ahead for construction of Sofia wind farm in the North Sea. In the spring of 2021, RWE made the final investment decision to build the Sofia wind farm in the UK North Sea, one of the largest offshore wind projects in the world. We hold a 100/uni2009% stake in the project. Sofia will be located almost 200 kilometres off the coast of North East England. It will consist of 100 turbines with a total installed capacity of 1,400 MW, and will be capable of supplying green electricity to approximately 1.2 million homes in the UK. June 2021 saw the start of onshore construction, with offshore work scheduled to begin in 2023. According to current plans, Sofia is set to take its full capacity online by 2026. We will be contractually remunerated for electricity generated by the wind farm in the amount of \u00a339.65/uni2009//uni2009MWh. This amount is based on the 2012 price level and will be subject to an upward adjustment for inflation. We anticipate investing about \u00a33 billion in Sofia. This includes expenditure for the grid connection, which we will sell on completion.",

We have joined forces with foreign partners to improve our growth opportunities in the offshore wind business. The following is a brief overview of some of the most recent collaborations.\n\n- \u00b7  In May 2021, we agreed with UK-based National Grid Ventures that we would jointly participate in the New York Bight seabed lease auctions. In February 2022, we secured a site in a tender process with the potential for about 3 GW in generation capacity (see page 45).\n- \u00b7  Also in May, we signed an agreement with Equinor and Hydro to develop a wind energy project in the S\u00f8rlige Nordsj\u00f8 II area in the Norwegian North Sea. The site neighbours Danish waters and has excellent wind conditions. The favourable location should allow us to sell electricity both within and outside of Norway.\n- \u00b7  In September, we forged a further alliance with Norwegian partners. Together with NTE and Havfram, we plan to participate in auctions for floating wind farms. The Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy has earmarked an area known as Utsira Nord off the country's southern coast for this purpose. The site can accommodate wind turbines with a total capacity of up to 1.5 GW.\n- \u00b7  Floating wind farms are also the focus of a partnership in South Korea, which we finalised with the port city of Ulsan in November. Together with our local partner, our objective is to implement projects to create up to 1.5 GW in generation capacity off the coast of the country. South Korea is aiming for 12 GW in offshore wind capacity by 2030 and wants to be climate neutral by 2050.\n- \u00b7  In February 2022 we joined forces with Tata Power, India's largest power generator, to develop offshore wind projects along the country's 7,600-kilometre coastline. India has also set ambitious renewables expansion targets, and aims to have 30 GW in offshore capacity by 2030.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nThree major US wind farms start commercial operation. We completed three onshore wind projects in the USA in 2021. In the spring, Scioto Ridge went online commercially after about two-and-a-half years of construction. It is our first wind farm in the state of Ohio and has a total capacity of 250 MW. In the summer, we completed two further large-scale wind farms: West Raymond in Texas and Cassadaga in the US state of New York. The wind farms have capacities of 240 MW and 125 MW, respectively. A total of more than \u20ac800 million was invested in the three projects.\n\nStakes in four Texan wind farms sold. To increase our financial strength and better balance our generation portfolio, we sold shares in four Texan wind farms: Stella (201 MW), Cranell (220 MW), East Raymond (200 MW), and West Raymond, which was mentioned earlier. The buyers are a subsidiary of Canadian energy utility Algonquin Power/uni2009&/uni2009Utilities and UK investor Greencoat, which took an interest of 51/uni2009% and 24/uni2009% in the wind farms. RWE is therefore only a minority shareholder but is staying on as the operator of these assets. We no longer fully consolidate them in our financial reporting and instead account for them using the equity method. The sale was agreed in December 2020 and was completed in January (Stella/uni2009//uni2009Cranell/uni2009//uni2009East Raymond) and August 2021 (West Raymond).\n\nAustralian Limondale solar farm is officially connected to the grid. In autumn 2021, our Limondale solar farm went online in the Australian state of New South Wales. With a capacity of 249 MW, the photovoltaic system is one of the largest in the country. It consists of approximately 872,000 solar panels, spread over a 900-hectare site. Construction started in 2018. Our capital expenditure on Limondale amounted to approximately \u20ac330 million.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\nMajor events\n\nRWE sets the stage to expand solar power in Greece. In October, we set up a joint venture with energy group Public Power Corporation (PPC) to realise solar projects in Greece. RWE and PPC own 51/uni2009% and 49/uni2009% of the new company, respectively. Our partner is the country's largest power utility and will contribute photovoltaic projects with up to 940 MW of capacity to the joint venture. RWE will bring a project pipeline of a similar size to the table. The undertakings are in various stages of development. Based on current plans, the first farms will be commissioned in 2023.\n\nBelectric Group solar services business sold. In December, the Dutch energy service provider Elevion acquired parts of the Belectric Group from RWE. Assets affected by the transaction were companies in Europe and Israel which provide services relating to the construction, operation and maintenance of solar farms. Elevion is part of \u010cEZ, the Czech Republic's largest energy utility. Belectric's battery business remains within the RWE Group. It was transferred to RWE Battery Solutions in 2020.\n\nRWE sells small hydropower plants to KELAG. Austrian energy utility KELAG acquired twelve French and seven Portuguese hydro assets from us, which have a total installed capacity of 62 MW (RWE's pro-rata share). We also sold a number of small wind turbines in Portugal with a combined capacity of 3 MW to KELAG. A corresponding agreement was reached at the end of 2020. We transferred the French plants in April 2021, and the Portuguese assets followed in September. KELAG is a leading hydropower producer. We currently hold a 37.9/uni2009% stake in the company.\n\nGreen light for the construction of two mega batteries in Germany. We will contribute to safeguarding security of supply in the future with two high-capacity batteries at our power plant sites in Werne and Lingen. This decision was taken in June. We expect the battery storage units to have outputs of 72 MW (Werne) and 45 MW (Lingen) as well as storage capacities of 79 MWh and 49 MWh, respectively. They are due to go online at the end of 2022. We intend to invest some \u20ac50 million in total.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nPartnership with Shell on hydrogen projects. In November, we reached an agreement with Shell to intensify our collaborative efforts to build a European hydrogen economy. Working together with the British energy group, we will develop projects to produce, use and sell hydrogen. RWE and Shell are already partners in the trailblazing hydrogen projects AquaVentus in Germany (see page 32) and NortH2 in the Netherlands. RWE and Shell intend to take the next step and initiate large-scale projects in the United Kingdom for the production of green hydrogen using offshore wind energy. The partnership also encompasses measures to decarbonise gas and biomass-fired power stations within the RWE Group. To this end, we will explore the following alternatives: carbon capture and storage as well as retrofitting stations to use environmentally friendly hydrogen.\n\nSuccess in British capacity market auction. In March 2021, RWE assets totalling 6,544 MW in secured generation capacity - primarily gas-fired power stations - qualified for a payment at a capacity market auction in Great Britain. The bidding process related to the period from 1 October 2024 to 30 September 2025. Stations with a total capacity of 40.8 GW won a contract. These assets will be remunerated for being online and contributing to electricity supply in the aforementioned period. The auction cleared at \u00a318.00/uni2009//uni2009kW (plus inflation adjustment).\n\nOnce-in-a-century Texan cold snap weighs heavily on earnings. In February 2021, an extraordinary cold front in parts of the USA curtailed energy supply substantially (see page 39). Winter storms and freezing rain forced RWE wind farms to go offline for several days. We had sold forward a portion of the generation of these assets and therefore had to conduct short-term spot purchases in order to meet our supply obligations. Due to the tight supply situation and regulatory price interventions, we had to pay up to US$9,000/uni2009//uni2009MWh for these electricity purchases. This reduced the adjusted EBITDA in the Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar segment by approximately \u20ac400 million.",

In mid-July, severe weather events in parts of Germany led to disastrous floods resulting in a large number of fatalities and substantial damage to property. Rhineland-Palatinate and the south of North Rhine-Westphalia were the most devastated regions. The extreme weather also affected our company and its employees. In the Rhenish lignite mining area, water ingress at the Inden opencast mine brought production to a temporary halt. We are deeply saddened that an employee of a partner company was swept away in the floods and could not be saved despite a major rescue operation. In Erftstadt-Blessem, located near Cologne, the Erft river burst its banks, flooding a gravel pit operated by a subsidiary of RWE Power. Nearly all RWE-operated run-of-river power plants in the Eifel and on the Mosel, Saar and Ruhr rivers were forced to interrupt operations due to the floodwaters. Within a few days, however, these stations and the Inden mines were available once more. Our financial burdens resulting from the disastrous flooding will total a figure in the low two-digit million euro range. RWE provided about \u20ac2 million to an emergency relief programme, one quarter of which was donated by our staff.\n\nRWE stops generating electricity from hard coal in Germany. In the middle of last year, our last German hard coal units, Westfalen E at Hamm (764 MW) and Ibbenb\u00fcren B (794 MW), were closed for good. At the end of 2020, we successfully participated in the first nationwide shutdown auction for hard coal-fired power plants with these assets. We received \u20ac216 million in compensation for their early decommissioning. In the first half of 2021, we were forbidden from selling electricity generated by these assets, but were obligated to keep them on standby to ensure security of supply. During this period, Westfalen E went online 13 times at the request of the transmission system operator. The station is envisaged to continue to contribute to security of supply, albeit without using hard coal. As the German Network Agency has classified the power plant as system-relevant, we will convert the generator to a rotary phase shifter to produce reactive power to maintain voltage levels, an important element in stabilising the electricity grid. Conversely, Ibbenb\u00fcren B has not been deemed to be system-relevant and will be fully decommissioned.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther lignite-fired power stations taken offline. During the year under review we closed five 300 MW power plant units in the Rhenish lignite mining region. To comply with the German Coal Phaseout Act, we took Neurath B (294 MW), Niederaussem C (295 MW) and Weisweiler E (321 MW) offline at the end of December. The Frimmersdorf lignite power plant was shut down three months earlier. The station's last two units P (284 MW) and Q (278 MW) had been placed on security stand-by on 1 October 2017. This meant that they were forbidden by law from participating in the market, but had to remain available as a safeguard to ensure security of supply when necessary. They were shut down for good on expiry of the security stand-by period. Most employees affected by the lignite exit will retire. Younger staff members will transfer to other areas within the Group or will receive severance packages.\n\nGundremmingen C nuclear power station stops operating. Also at the end of 2021, we took Unit C of the Gundremmingen nuclear power plant offline. The plant was commissioned in 1984 and had a net installed capacity of 1,288 MW. Its closure and current dismantling are a result of the roadmap dictated by the German nuclear phaseout. We took Unit B of the Gundremmingen nuclear power station offline at the end of 2017. Now electricity generation at the site has stopped entirely. About 540 people were working there as of 31 December 2021. This number will likely drop to about 440 by the end of 2022. We will implement further socially acceptable redundancies in the years thereafter.",

At the end of February 2022, we were successful in an auction of seabed leases for offshore wind sites in the New York Bight. A joint venture between RWE and National Grid Ventures secured an area for US$1.1 billion. About 3 GW of generation capacity can be built at the site, which would be capable of producing enough electricity to power 1.1 million US homes. The auction included six lease sites, with bidders only being allowed to secure one each. Every successful bid conferred the right to develop a site and participate in upcoming offtake auctions in the states of New York and New Jersey. If the project progresses as planned, our offshore wind farm in the New York Bight will be commissioned before the end of the decade.\n\nWind joint venture with Northland Power launched. In January 2022, RWE and Northland Power formed a joint venture for the development of wind energy projects in the German North Sea. We expect this partnership to deliver substantial synergies, resulting in cost savings in the development, construction and operation of the assets. RWE owns 51/uni2009% and our Canadian partner owns 49/uni2009% of the joint venture, which encompasses three offshore wind projects aiming to develop a total capacity of 1.3 GW. The sites of the future wind farms are located north of the island of Juist. Before forging the joint venture, we had already worked with Northland Power on two of the three projects. One project is focused on a 433 MW wind farm on a site officially called N-3.8, which we secured via a step-in right following an invitation to tender in 2021 (see page 41). The other initiative involved the construction and operation of a 420 MW wind farm, which we hope to build on the N-3.5 site. We also have a step-in right for this area, but have not exercised it yet. RWE initially only held a 15/uni2009% share of both projects and had originally developed the third joint venture project alone. It is centred around a 480 MW wind farm at the N-3.6 site, for which we also hold a step-in right which has not yet been made use of. The auctions for the sites N-3.5 and N-3.6 should be held in 2023. In the event that other companies are successful, we can exercise our step-in rights.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nRWE once again successful in British capacity market auctions. Another auction, relating to the delivery period from 1 October 2025 to 30 September 2026, was held for the British capacity market on 22 February. We secured a payment for all participating RWE power stations, including two small new-builds. Altogether, these assets have a secured capacity of 6,647 MW. At \u00a330.59 / kW per annum (plus inflation adjustment). A total of 42.4 GW in generation capacity qualified for a payment at the auction.\n\nHuge uncertainty after Russia attacks Ukraine. Russian troops marched into Ukraine at the end of February. As an invasion under international law, it prompted outrage and consternation around the globe. Many countries including the USA, EU member states and the United Kingdom imposed economic sanctions on Russia. Uncertainty concerning commodity deliveries from Russia to Europe has caused a significant increase in gas and electricity trading quotations. In some European countries, including Germany, governments are working on measures to reduce dependency on Russian oil and gas imports. When this review of operations was prepared in early March 2022, it was impossible to predict the development of the Ukraine conflict or its consequences. Although RWE does not have business activities in Russia or Ukraine, further escalation of the conflict and discontinuation of supply relationships with Russian companies could have notable effects on our assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. More detailed information can be found in the chapter entitled 'Development of risks and opportunities', which starts on page 70.",

Renewable energy, gas-fired power plants, energy storage, our hydrogen business and energy trading are distributed among the first four segments. They play a key role in the energy transition and therefore make up our core business. The fifth segment covers power generation from coal and nuclear energy, which will increasingly lose importance due to legally mandated phaseout roadmaps.\n\nGroup structure features five segments. We distinguish between five segments when reporting our business performance. The first four form our core business. Our segments are defined as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Offshore Wind: We present our business relating to offshore wind here. It is overseen by our Group company RWE Renewables.\n- \u00b7 Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar: This is the segment in which we pool our onshore wind and solar business as well as parts of our battery storage activities. Here again, responsibility lies with RWE Renewables.\n- \u00b7 Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas: Generation from our run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass and gas power stations is pooled here. The segment also includes the Dutch Amer 9 and Eemshaven power plants, which run on biomass and hard coal, as well as individual battery storage systems. The project management and engineering consulting company RWE/uni00A0Technology International and our 37.9/uni2009% stake in Austrian energy utility KELAG are also allocated to this segment. The activities are overseen by RWE Generation. In addition, since 2021, this management company has been responsible for designing and implementing our hydrogen strategy.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n- \u00b7 Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading: Proprietary trading of energy commodities is at the core of this segment and is overseen by RWE/uni00A0Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading. The company also acts as an intermediary for gas, supplies key accounts with energy, and undertakes a number of additional trading-related activities. Our German and Czech gas storage facilities also form part of this segment.\n- \u00b7 Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear: This is where we report on the activities which are not part of our core business as their importance is declining due to the course set by the energy policy in our domestic market, Germany. First and foremost, these consist of our German electricity generation from coal and nuclear fuel as well as our lignite production in the Rhenish mining region to the west of Cologne. This is also where we report our investments/uni00A0in Dutch nuclear power plant operator EPZ (30/uni2009%) and Germany-based URANIT (50/uni2009%), which holds a 33/uni2009% stake in uranium enrichment specialist Urenco. Most of the aforementioned activities and investments are overseen by RWE Power. RWE Generation is responsible for our German hard coal-fired power plants; we shut down the last two stations in mid-2021.\n\nGroup companies with cross-segment tasks, such as the Group holding company RWE AG, are stated as part of the core business under the 'other, consolidation' line item. This also applies to our stakes of 25.1/uni2009% in German transmission system operator Amprion and 15/uni2009% in E.ON. However, the dividends we receive from E.ON are recognised in the financial result. Furthermore, 'other, consolidation' contains consolidation effects.",

At the start of fiscal 2021, we changed the way in which we account for tax benefits received for US wind and solar projects. Renewable energy is subsidised largely via tax credits in the USA. Furthermore, plant operators can benefit from accelerated depreciation, referred to as tax benefits. Until 2020, they were recognised in taxes on income, whereas the benefits of tax credits were considered in other operating income. For the sake of consistency, we have also been recognising tax benefits since 2021. It has a positive impact on adjusted EBITDA. To ensure comparability, we restated the prior-year figures. More information can be found in the Notes on pages 108 et seq.\n\nForward-looking statements. This report contains forward-looking statements regarding the future development of the RWE Group and its companies as well as economic and political developments. These statements are assessments that we have made based on information available to us at the time this document was prepared. Despite this, actual developments can deviate from the prognoses, for instance if underlying assumptions do not materialise or unforeseen risks arise. Therefore, we cannot assume responsibility for the correctness of forward-looking statements.\n\nReferences.

Prior-year figures adjusted accordingly.\n- 2   Including production volumes not attributable to any of the energy sources mentioned (e./uni2009g. electricity from waste-to-energy plants).\n\nElectricity production 14/uni2009% up on prior year. In the fiscal year that just came to a close, the RWE Group produced 160,773 GWh of electricity. Deviating from the former recognition method, this figure does not include power purchases from generation assets in which we do not own the majority, even if we have long-term usage rights to them. Prior-year figures including the purchases have been adjusted accordingly. Our electricity generation grew by 14/uni2009% compared to 2020. The most significant increases were recorded by our German lignite power stations, which benefited from favourable market conditions. Contributing factors were the rise in electricity consumption compared to the previous year thanks to the economic recovery, as well as the weather-induced drop in wind energy fed into the system. For these reasons and despite a significant hike in fuel costs, our UK gas-fired power\n\nstations were also utilised more than in 2020, whereas generation from gas was down in Germany and the Netherlands. Our Dutch power plants Amer 9 and Eemshaven, which run on biomass and hard coal, stepped up production considerably. The rise at Eemshaven was due to the station's return to nearly full availability after fire damage in the preceding year. Our German nuclear power stations also posted a substantial rise, because there were fewer maintenance outages. A counteracting effect was felt from the German coal phaseout. At the end of 2020, we ceased commercial operation of the Ibbenb\u00fcren B (794 MW) and Westfalen E (764 MW) hard coal-fired power plants and shut down the Niederaussem D (297 MW) lignite unit.",

A positive effect was felt from the increase in our stake in the Rampion offshore wind farm (400 MW) in the UK as of 1 April 2021 from 30.1/uni2009% to 50.1/uni2009% and the full consolidation of Rampion since then. Furthermore, we commissioned the Scioto Ridge (250 MW) and Cassadaga (125 MW) wind farms in the USA and started feeding electricity from the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm (857 MW) in the UK into the grid. Opposing effects were felt from lower wind speeds and the sale of majority stakes in wind farms in Texas (see page 42).\n\nIn addition to our in-house generation, we procure electricity from suppliers outside of the Group. In the year being reviewed, these purchases totalled 48,131 GWh. In-house production and power purchases combined for 208,904 GWh (previous year: 200,715 GWh).\n\nLower generation capacity due to coal power plant closures. At the end of 2021, we had an installed power production capacity of 36.1 GW. This figure does not include our three German lignite units, which are in legally mandated security standby and will be shut down for good in 2022/uni2009//uni20092023. Certain assets, where we are not the majority owner and which generate electricity that we can completely or partially use on the basis of long-term usage agreements, are also disregarded. In the past, we included the capacities of these stations in the figures if we were entitled to the associated generation. Prior-year figures were adjusted.",

In line with the German coal phaseout, we decommissioned the Niederaussem C (295 MW), Neurath B (294 MW) and Weisweiler E (321 MW) lignite units as of 31 December 2021. The legal lifetime of the Gundremmingen C (1,288 MW) nuclear power station ended on the same day. By contrast, we increased production capacity from renewables by 0.6 GW in part as a result of our fully consolidating the Rampion offshore wind farm for the first time. Furthermore, we completed the Limondale (249 MW) solar farm in Australia as well as the Scioto Ridge and Cassadaga wind farms in the USA, whereas the sale of majority stakes in the Texan wind farms Stella (201 MW), Cranell (220 MW) and East Raymond (200 MW) had a counteracting effect.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nIn terms of generation capacity, gas is our main energy source, accounting for a share of 40/uni2009% at the close of 2021. Renewables take second place, with a share of 30/uni2009%. Our biggest source of renewable energy is wind (8.9 GW), followed by biomass (0.8 GW), hydro (0.5 GW) and solar (0.5 GW).\n\nThe geographic focus of our generation business is Germany, where 42/uni2009% of our installed capacity is located. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands follow, accounting for shares of 27/uni2009% and 14/uni2009%, respectively. The USA comes in fourth: about half of our onshore wind capacity is situated there, a large portion of which is in Texas.\n\n| Installed capacity 1                              | Renewables   | Renewables   | Pumped storage,   batteries   | Pumped storage,   batteries   | Gas    | Gas    | Lignite   | Lignite   | Hard coal   | Hard coal   | Nuclear   | Nuclear   | Total 2   | Total 2   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| As of 31 December, MW                             | 2021         | 2020         | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2021   | 2020   | 2021      | 2020      | 2021        | 2020        | 2021      | 2020      | 2021      | 2020      |\n| Offshore Wind                                     | 2,318        | 1,918        | -                             | -                             | -      | -      | -         | -         | -           | -           | -         | -         | 2,318     | 1,918     |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                | 7,082        | 6,858        | 28                            | 20                            | -      | -      | -         | -         | -           | -           | -         | -         | 7,110     | 6,877     |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas | 1,285        | 1,319        | 168                           | 172                           | 13,901 | 13,901 | -         | -         | 1,469       | 1,474       | -         | -         | 17,115    | 17,158    |\n| of which:                                         |              |              |                               |                               |        |        |           |           |             |             |           |           |           |           |\n| Germany                                           | 393          | 389          | 168                           | 172                           | 3,807  | 3,807  | -         | -         | -           | -           | -         | -         | 4,407     | 4,407     |\n| United Kingdom                                    | 139          | 137          | -                             | -                             | 6,984  | 6,984  | -         | -         | -           | -           | -         | -         | 7,376     | 7,374     |\n| Netherlands /uni2009//uni2009Belgium              | 753          | 748          | -                             | -                             | 2,323  | 2,323  | -         | -         | 1,469       | 1,474       | -         | -         | 4,545     | 4,545     |\n| Turkey                                            | -            | -            | -                             | -                             | 787    | 787    | -         | -         | -           | -           | -         | -         | 787       | 787       |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                      | 12           | 7            | -                             | -                             | 400    | 400    | 7,638     | 8,548     | -           | -           | 1,482     | 2,770     | 9,559     | 11,752    |\n| RWE Group 3                                       | 10,697       | 10,102       | 199                           | 194                           | 14,301 | 14,301 | 7,638     | 8,548     | 1,469       | 1,474       | 1,482     | 2,770     | 36,104    | 37,708    |",

Last year, our power stations emitted 80.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, 13.9 million metric tons more than in 2020. This represents the first increase after eight years of emissions reductions totalling 62/uni2009%, and despite the fact that we closed further coal power plants. In 2021, a series of factors drove up usage of our lignite-fired power stations: besides a recovery of demand for electricity, lower generation volumes from wind farms also played a part. In addition, gas-fired power plants were less competitive, due to soaring fuel costs. We expect to return back to our ambitious emission reduction path in 2022.\n\nOur specific emissions, i./uni2009e. the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per megawatt hour of electricity generated, amounted to 0.50 metric tons in the fiscal year that just came to a close. The previous year's figure stood at 0.47 metric tons.\n\n| CO2 emissions of our power stations 1             | 2021   | 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Million metric tons                               |        |        |                       |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas | 25.0   | 20.3   | 4.7                   |\n| of which:                                         |        |        |                       |\n| Germany                                           | 2.6    | 3.5    | -/uni20090.9          |\n| United Kingdom                                    | 12.8   | 9.1    | 3.7                   |\n| Netherlands                                       | 8.0    | 6.1    | 1.9                   |\n| Turkey                                            | 1.6    | 1.6    | -                     |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                      | 55.9   | 46.7   | 9.2                   |\n| RWE Group                                         | 80.9   | 67.0   | 13.9                  |",

Our generation companies procure the fuel they need either directly on the market or via RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading, except for lignite, which we source from proprietary opencast mines. In our Rhenish mining area west of Cologne, we produced 62.6 million metric tons of lignite last year. This was 11.2 million metric tons more than in the preceding year, owing to the higher utilisation of our power plants. We used the lion's share, or 53.2 million metric tons, of lignite to generate electricity. The remainder was used to manufacture refined products (e./uni2009g. lignite powder, hearth furnace coke and briquettes) and, to a limited extent, to generate process steam and district heat.\n\nElectricity and gas sales 4/uni2009% and 25/uni2009% higher year on year. Last year, we sold 203,101 GWh of electricity and 45,721 GWh of gas. These transactions were largely carried out by the Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading segment. We sold 4/uni2009% more of our main product, electricity. This growth can be traced back to the rise in generation from our power stations, which we usually sell externally via our Group company RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading. Gas deliveries were up 25/uni2009%. One contributing factor was that RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading won new key accounts, most notably municipal utilities. In addition, existing customers increased their gas purchases from us.\n\nExternal revenue 79/uni2009% up on 2020. Revenue from external customers (excluding natural gas tax and electricity tax) totalled \u20ac24,526 million in 2021. This represents a 79/uni2009% increase over the previous year. Electricity revenue grew by 75/uni2009% to \u20ac20,476 million, primarily due to the steep rise in the price of electricity last year. Price effects were also the main reason why our gas revenue quadrupled to \u20ac2,142 million. Additional information on the development of commodity quotations can be found on pages 38 et seq.\n\nOne key performance indicator that is of particular interest to Sustainability investors is the portion of our revenue accounted for by coal-fired generation and other coal products. In the fiscal year that just ended, this share was 22/uni2009% (previous year: 23/uni2009%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n| External revenue                                                        | 2021   | 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                               |        |        |                       |\n| Offshore Wind                                                           | 688    | 332    | 356                   |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                                      | 2,324  | 1,855  | 469                   |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas                       | 1,315  | 1,056  | 259                   |\n| Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading                                          | 19,296 | 9,597  | 9,699                 |\n| Other                                                                   | 4      | 9      | -/uni20095            |\n| Core business                                                           | 23,627 | 12,849 | 10,778                |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                                            | 899    | 839    | 60                    |\n| RWE Group (excluding natural gas tax/uni2009//uni2009  electricity tax) | 24,526 | 13,688 | 10,838                |\n| Natural gas tax/uni2009//uni2009electricity tax                         | 235    | 208    | 27                    |\n| RWE Group                                                               | 24,761 | 13,896 | 10,865                |\n| External revenue by product                                             | 2021   | 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n| \u20ac million Electricity revenue                                           | 20,476 | 11,701 | 8,775                 |\n| of which:                                                               |        |        |                       |\n| Offshore Wind                                                           | 688    | 332    | 356                   |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                                      | 2,107  | 1,676  | 431                   |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas                       | 877    | 684    | 193                   |\n| Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading                                          | 16,540 | 8,775  | 7,765                 |\n| Core business                                                           | 20,212 | 11,468 | 8,744                 |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                                            | 264    | 233    | 31                    |\n| Gas revenue                                                             | 2,142  | 534    | 1,608                 |\n| of which: Supply & Trading                                              | 2,142  | 529    | 1,613                 |\n| Other revenue                                                           | 1,908  | 1,453  | 455                   |\n| RWE Group (excluding natural gas tax/uni2009//uni2009  electricity tax) | 24,526 | 13,688 | 10,838                |",

Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (adjusted EBITDA) amounted to \u20ac3,650 million. This is far above our March 2021 forecast. The outlook we published on pages 67 et seq. of the 2020 Annual Report envisaged a range of \u20ac2,650 million to \u20ac3,050 million. Adjusted EBITDA from our core business was also significantly better than originally expected, totalling \u20ac2,761 million. We had anticipated a figure between \u20ac1,800 million and \u20ac2,200 million. The fact that we easily exceeded our forecast was predominantly thanks to an outstanding energy trading performance. We also closed the fiscal year above the forecast ranges in the Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar and Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas segments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nOur adjusted EBITDA was 11/uni2009% up on the prior year. In addition to the exceptional trading performance, improved margins of our lignite and nuclear power stations came to bear in particular. This was contrasted by significant charges in our US wind energy business. As set out on page 43, in early 2021, the worst cold snap in a century in Texas led to unscheduled plant outages, forcing us to fulfil existing electricity supply commitments with expensive power purchases on the market.\n\nThe following developments were observed in the segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA posted here amounted to \u20ac1,110 million. We had forecast a range of \u20ac1,050 million to \u20ac1,250 million. We recorded a gain of 4/uni2009% compared to 2020 (\u20ac1,069 million). One contributing factor was that we took a majority interest in the Rampion offshore wind farm in the UK as of 1 April 2021 and have fully consolidated this stake since then. Furthermore, we benefited from the partial commissioning of the Triton Knoll offshore wind farm. This was contrasted by earnings shortfalls caused by the reduced utilisation of our assets due to the weather.\n- \u00b7 Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar: In this segment, adjusted EBITDA totalled \u20ac258 million. We were therefore slightly above the targeted range of \u20ac50 million to \u20ac250 million. Improved margins resulting from the recent significant increase in wholesale electricity prices were the main driver. Compared to the previous year (\u20ac523 million) however, adjusted EBITDA dropped considerably. This was primarily due to about \u20ac400 million in lost earnings caused by the severe cold snap in Texas in February 2021. Besides this exceptional effect, lower wind speeds also came to bear. By contrast, we benefited from the commissioning of new generation assets and capital gains on the sale of stakes in the US wind farms Stella, Cranell, East Raymond and West Raymond.",

This clearly exceeded the forecast range of \u20ac500 million to \u20ac600 million. Our outlook was based on the assumption that income from the commercial optimisation of our power plant dispatch would fall short of the high level achieved in 2020. In fact, however, it rose, especially in the fourth quarter. This is why we also exceeded adjusted EBITDA registered in the prior year (\u20ac621 million). The markedly improved availability of the Eemshaven power station also played a role.\n- \u00b7 Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading: Our performance in the trading business was exceptional. This led to \u20ac769 million in adjusted EBITDA, which clearly surpassed the envisaged range of \u20ac150 million to \u20ac350 million. We also exceeded the previous year's figure, which was very high (\u20ac539 million). In addition to the strong trading performance, improved earnings in the gas business also came to bear.\n- \u00b7 Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear: Adjusted EBITDA recorded in this segment amounted to \u20ac889 million, which was within the anticipated range of \u20ac800 million to \u20ac900 million. This represents strong growth compared to the preceding year (\u20ac559 million). The main reason for this was that we realised higher wholesale prices for electricity generated by our lignite-fired and nuclear power plants than in 2020. We had already sold forward nearly all of the production of these stations in earlier years. Income from the commercial optimisation of power plant dispatch also rose. Furthermore, we benefited from the improved availability of our nuclear power stations. This was contrasted by earnings shortfalls caused by extensive maintenance at lignite-fired power plants. Further burdens stemmed from the implementation of the German Coal Phaseout Act and the floods in the Rhenish lignite mining region, on which we report on page 44.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n| Reconciliation to net income 1 \u20ac million                                | 2021           | 2020           | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                         | 3,650          | 3,286          | 364                   |\n| Operating depreciation, amortisation and   impairment losses            | -/uni20091,465 | -/uni20091,463 | -/uni20092            |\n| Adjusted EBIT                                                           | 2,185          | 1,823          | 362                   |\n| Non-operating result                                                    | -/uni2009650   | -/uni2009104   | -/uni2009546          |\n| Financial result                                                        | -/uni200913    | -/uni2009454   | 441                   |\n| Income from continuing operations before taxes                          | 1,522          | 1,265          | 257                   |\n| Taxes on income                                                         | -/uni2009690   | -/uni2009376   | -/uni2009314          |\n| Income from continuing operations                                       | 832            | 889            | -/uni200957           |\n| Income from discontinued operations                                     | -              | 221            | -/uni2009221          |\n| Income                                                                  | 832            | 1,110          | -/uni2009278          |\n| of which:                                                               |                |                |                       |\n| Non-controlling interests                                               | 111            | 59             | 52                    |\n| Net income/uni2009//uni2009income attributable   to RWE AG shareholders | 721            | 1,051          | -/uni2009330          |\n\n- 1   Some prior-year figures restated due to a change in the recognition of tax benefits to subsidise renewable energy in the USA (see commentary on page 47).\n\n## Reconciliation to net income: Exceptional effects overshadow operating development.\n\nThe reconciliation from adjusted EBITDA to net income was greatly affected by one-off effects, which had a negative impact in net terms.

This growth was driven by the same factors that bolstered adjusted EBITDA. The difference between these two key figures is that operating depreciation and amortisation, which at \u20ac1,465 million was basically on a par with the previous year's level (\u20ac1,463 million), is included in adjusted EBIT, but not in adjusted EBITDA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n| Non-operating result 1                              | 2021         | 2020           | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                           |              |                |                       |\n| Disposal result                                     | 21           | 13             | 8                     |\n| Effects on income from the valuation of derivatives | -/uni2009503 | 1,886          | -/uni20092,389        |\n| Other                                               | -/uni2009168 | -/uni20092,003 | 1,835                 |\n| Non-operating result                                | -/uni2009650 | -/uni2009104   | -/uni2009546          |\n\n- 1   Some prior-year figures restated due to a change in the recognition of tax benefits to subsidise renewable energy in the USA (see commentary on page 47).\n\nThe non-operating result, in which we recognise certain items which are not related to operations or the period being reviewed, amounted to -/uni2009\u20ac650 million as opposed to -/uni2009\u20ac104 million in the preceding fiscal year. Its components developed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  At \u20ac21 million, income from the disposal of investments and assets was essentially immaterial, as in the previous year (\u20ac13 million). It largely resulted from the sale of small run-of-river power stations in France and Portugal (see page 43).\n- \u00b7  Effects from the valuation of derivatives reduced earnings by \u20ac503 million, after increasing them by \u20ac1,886 million in the preceding year. Such impacts are only temporary and are primarily due to the fact that, pursuant to IFRS, financial instruments used to hedge price risks are accounted for at fair value at the corresponding balance-sheet date, whereas the hedged underlying transactions are only recognised as a profit or loss when they are realised.\n- \u00b7  In the 'other' line item, we reported a loss of \u20ac168 million, which was much smaller than in the previous year (\u20ac2,003 million). Income in 2020 was curtailed by about \u20ac1.8 billion in impairments recognised for power plants and opencast lignite mines. Impairments relating to our lignite business were also recognised in the year being reviewed. They amounted to \u20ac780 million and are explained in more detail in the Notes on pages 112 et seq. Income benefited from the \u20ac880 million compensation for the nuclear phaseout in Germany we received from the government in November 2021.",

Its components changed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Net interest dropped by \u20ac67 million to -/uni2009\u20ac80 million, in part due to higher interest expenses in connection with currency hedges and higher costs incurred to pledge collateral in energy trading. Net interest includes the dividend on our 15/uni2009% stake in E.ON, which totalled \u20ac186 million (previous year: \u20ac182 million).\n- \u00b7  The interest accretion to non-current provisions reduced income by \u20ac138 million. In the previous year, the decline was more substantial (\u20ac255 million) because we had lowered the discount rate applied when calculating our mining provisions and the resulting increase in the present value of the obligations had in part been recognised as an expense in the interest accretion.\n- \u00b7  The other financial result rose by \u20ac391 million to \u20ac205 million. The main reason for the increase was a one-off effect of interest claims in relation to a tax refund for earlier assessment periods. Furthermore, a charge incurred in the prior year did not recur: in March 2020, we suffered substantial losses on security holdings owing to the turmoil on financial markets caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nIncome from continuing operations before tax grew by \u20ac257 million to \u20ac1,522 million. At 45/uni2009%, our effective tax rate was unusually high. One contributing factor was that we wrote off or did not recognise deferred tax assets in RWE AG's tax group, because we are unlikely to be able to use the deferred tax claims in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, an increase in the UK corporation tax rate effective as of 2023 drove up deferred tax liabilities. By contrast, the aforementioned tax refund for earlier years provided some relief.\n\nIn the fiscal year being reviewed, there was no income from discontinued operations. In the preceding year, this figure amounted to \u20ac221 million. It stemmed from the stake in Slovak energy utility VSE, which we sold to E.ON in August 2020.\n\nNon-controlling interests in income rose by \u20ac52 million to \u20ac111 million. This is because we started fully consolidating Rampion in April 2021 and reduced our stake in the Humber Gateway wind farm in the UK North Sea (219 MW) from 100/uni2009% to 51/uni2009% at the end of 2020. Consequently, we now state non-controlling interests of the co-owners of these wind farms. A counteracting effect was felt from the sale of VSE: in 2020, a profit of \u20ac34 million had been assigned to the company's co-shareholders.\n\nThe RWE Group's net income amounted to \u20ac721 million (previous year: \u20ac1,051 million). This resulted in earnings per share of \u20ac1.07 (previous year: \u20ac1.65). The number of RWE shares outstanding used to calculate this indicator totalled 676.2 million compared to 637.3 million in the previous year. These figures are annual averages. In August 2020, we issued 61.5 million new RWE shares via a capital increase.",

Adjusted net income amounted to \u20ac1,569 million. Due to the unexpectedly positive development of operating earnings, it was well above the guided range of \u20ac750 million to \u20ac1,100 million. The prior-year figure of \u20ac1,257 million was also clearly exceeded. To calculate adjusted net income, we corrected net income according to IFRS by deducting the non-operating result and major special items in the financial result from it. Instead of the actual tax rate, we applied a rate of 15/uni2009%, which reflects the tax level net of one-off effects that can theoretically be expected.\n\n- 1   Table only shows cash investments.\n- 2   Including a -/uni2009\u20ac4 million consolidation effect between the core business and the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment.\n\n| Capital expenditure on financial assets 1 \u20ac million   | 2021   | 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| Offshore Wind                                         | 27     | 520    | -/uni2009493          |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                    | 27     | 408    | -/uni2009381          |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas     | 6      | 115    | -/uni2009109          |\n| Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading                        | 20     | 18     | 2                     |\n| Other, consolidation                                  | -      | 11     | -/uni200911           |\n| Core business                                         | 80     | 1,072  | -/uni2009992          |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                          | -      | 1      | -/uni20091            |\n| RWE Group                                             | 80     | 1,073  | -/uni2009993          |\n\n- 1   Table only shows cash investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements",

In the past fiscal year, our capital spending totalled \u20ac3,769 million, 12/uni2009% more than in 2020 (\u20ac3,358 million). The lion's share of the funds was dedicated to the Offshore Wind (45/uni2009%) and Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar (38/uni2009%) segments.\n\nOur capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac3,689 million (previous year: \u20ac2,285 million). The Triton Knoll wind farm in the UK North Sea received the biggest share of investments. Significant sums were also spent to build the Sofia wind farm off the eastern coast of England (1,400 MW), the Kaskasi wind farm near Heligoland (342 MW), the Blackjack Creek (240 MW) and El Algodon Alto (200 MW) onshore wind farms in Texas, and the Hickory Park solar farm in the US state of Georgia (196 MW plus battery storage). In addition, we made advance payments for the rights we secured in an auction in February 2021 to develop new offshore wind areas in the UK North Sea (see page 40).\n\nAt \u20ac80 million, capital expenditure on financial assets was much lower than the high figure registered in the prior year (\u20ac1,073 million), which included our acquisitions of the 20/uni2009% stake in the Rampion offshore wind farm and Nordex's European development business (see page 43 of the 2020 Annual Report).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n| Workforce  1                                      | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Offshore Wind                                     | 1,277         | 1,119         | 158                   |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                | 2,146         | 2,402         | -/uni2009256          |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas | 2,606         | 2,667         | -/uni200961           |\n| Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading                    | 1,804         | 1,790         | 14                    |\n| Other 2                                           | 467           | 425           | 42                    |\n| Core business                                     | 8,300         | 8,403         | -/uni2009103          |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                      | 9,946         | 11,095        | -/uni20091,149        |\n| RWE Group                                         | 18,246        | 19,498        | -/uni20091,252        |\n\n- 1   Converted to full-time positions.\n- 2   This item exclusively comprises employees of the holding company RWE AG.\n\nHeadcount significantly down year on year. As of 31 December 2021, the RWE Group had 18,246 people on its payroll, of which 13,585 were employed in Germany and 4,661 worked abroad. Part-time positions were considered in these numbers on a pro-rata basis. Personnel figures were down markedly compared to the end of 2020 (-/uni20091,252). We recorded a significant decline (-/uni20091,149) in the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment where many employees accepted early retirement offers as part of the German coal phaseout. Although we created a large number of jobs by expanding renewable energy, headcount in our core business declined somewhat. The main reason for this was that we sold large parts of the Belectric Group.\n\nStaff figures do not include apprentices or trainees. At the end of 2021, 785 young adults were learning a profession at RWE, compared to 750 in the previous year.",

        "page_content": "2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\nFinancial position and net worth\n\n## 2.7  Financial position and net worth\n\nOur financial position and net worth continued to improve in 2021. Even though we invested billions in the expansion of renewables, our net debt fell to less than zero. As of the balance-sheet date, the RWE Group posted net assets of \u20ac360 million. This pleasing development was particularly thanks to our strong cash flow from operating activities. Our robust credit ratings also underline how strong our financial position is. The agencies Moody's and Fitch raised RWE's credit rating by one notch last year. Our current long-term ratings are investment grade, at Baa2 and BBB+ respectively.\n\nRWE AG bears responsibility for procuring funds. Responsibility for Group financing is centralised at RWE AG. As the parent company, RWE AG is responsible for acquiring funds from banks or the financial markets. Subsidiaries only raise debt capital directly in specific cases, for example if it is advantageous economically to make use of local credit and capital markets. RWE AG also acts as a co-ordinator when subsidiaries assume contingent liabilities. This allows us to manage and monitor financial risks centrally. Moreover, it strengthens our position when negotiating with banks, business partners, suppliers and customers.\n\nTools for raising debt capital. We cover most of our financing needs with earnings from our operating activities. In addition, we have a wide range of tools to procure debt capital:\n\n- \u00b7  Our Debt Issuance Programme (DIP) gives us latitude in raising debt capital for the long term. Our current DIP allows us to issue bonds with a total face value of up to \u20ac10 billion. By issuing three green bonds, we exercised this financing option in 2021 for the first time in six years.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n- \u00b7  For short-term refinancing, we have a Commercial Paper Programme, which was updated in 2021. It allows us to raise funds equivalent to up to \u20ac5 billion on the money market. During the past fiscal year, we accessed a large portion of this funding volume: at times, a total of up to \u20ac3 billion in commercial paper was outstanding.\n- \u00b7  To secure our liquidity, we also have access to a \u20ac5 billion syndicated credit line extended by a consortium of 27 international banks. It consists of two tranches: one of \u20ac2 billion, which expires in April 2022, and one of \u20ac3 billion, which is available through to April 2026. At our initiative, sustainability criteria were added to the conditions of the second tranche last year. Among other things, the conditions now depend on the development of the following three indicators: the share of renewables in RWE's generation portfolio, the CO 2 intensity of our plants and the percentage of our capex that is classified as sustainable in accordance with the EU taxonomy regulation. We have set goals for all three of these criteria. If we do not achieve the targets, we will have to pay higher interest and commitment fees. Half of the additional expenses would be directed to non-profit organisations. This new structure for the credit line underlines our commitment to our emissions reduction strategy.\n\nGreen bonds worth \u20ac1,850 million issued. For the first time ever, RWE AG issued green bonds in 2021. In June, we placed a 10-year bond with a nominal volume of \u20ac500 million and an annual coupon of 0.625/uni2009%, followed by two issues in November: a 7-year bond of \u20ac750 million and a 12-year bond of \u20ac600 million, with annual coupons of 0.5/uni2009% and 1.0/uni2009%, respectively. Additional information on these three debt securities can be found on page 21. The proceeds of green bonds are tied to specific purposes. We will use these funds exclusively for wind and solar projects.",

RWE bonds with a total face value equivalent to \u20ac2.4 billion were outstanding at the end of 2021, versus \u20ac0.6 billion in the previous year. The significant increase was due to the aforementioned issues. Along with the three green bonds, RWE still has two outstanding hybrid bonds: one of \u20ac282 million with a 3.5/uni2009% coupon and one of US$317 million with a 6.625/uni2009% coupon. Due to early buybacks in October 2017, the outstanding amounts are below the issuance volumes of \u20ac550 million and US$500 million. The earliest redemption dates for the two hybrid bonds are in April 2025 and March 2026, respectively.\n\n| Credit rating of RWE AG          | Moody's   | Moody's   | Fitch   | Fitch    |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| As of March 2022                 | Current   | Previous  | Current | Previous |\n| Long-term debt                   |           |           |         |          |\n| Senior debt                      | Baa2      | Baa3      | BBB+    | BBB      |\n| Subordinated debt (hybrid bonds) | Ba1       | Ba2       | BBB-    | BB+      |\n| Short-term debt                  | P-2       | P-3       | F1      | F2       |\n| Outlook                          | Stable    | Positive  | Stable  | Stable   |\n\nSolid investment grade rating. The conditions at which we can raise debt largely depend on rating agencies' assessment of our creditworthiness. Moody's and Fitch make such evaluations on request from us. In the past year, both agencies raised their credit rating for RWE by one notch. RWE's long-term creditworthiness is now rated Baa2 (Moody's) and BBB+ (Fitch), both with a stable outlook. These are investment grade ratings. The ratings for our hybrid bonds and current financial liabilities are now also one level higher (see table above).

Our cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to \u20ac7,274 million, clearly exceeding the prior-year figure (\u20ac4,125 million). The good earnings situation and the compensation paid to us in November 2021 by the German Federal government for the phaseout of nuclear energy had positive effects. The main reason for the increase, however, were high margin payments for forward contracts for electricity, fuel and CO 2 certificates. RWE concludes contracts of this kind to reduce earnings risk exposure. For exchange-traded derivatives, we first have to provide an initial margin. Additionally, over the term of the contract, we receive or pay variation margins, depending on how the market value of the derivative changes. So-called collateral has to be provided for over-the-counter derivative transactions.",

This was contrasted against significant outflows of funds for initial margins and collaterals, which we reported in cash flows from financing activities.\n\nInvesting activities of continuing operations led to a cash outflow of \u20ac7,738 million (previous year: \u20ac4,278 million). \u20ac3,769 million of this sum stemmed from our capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and financial assets. Moreover, we made significant investments in securities and an extraordinary increase of the assets used to meet pension obligations in the amount of \u20ac1,092 million. This was contrasted by revenues from the sale of business activities and shareholdings of \u20ac1,057 million. The most important transactions were the sale of our stakes in the US wind farms Stella, Cranell, East Raymond and West Raymond as well as the disposal of the grid connection for the Rampion offshore wind farm in  the UK (see page 41).\n\nFinancing activities of continuing operations produced cash inflows of \u20ac1,457 million (previous year: \u20ac1,769 million). In 2021, we recorded high income from bank loans taken out, the issuance of commercial paper and the three green bonds we issued, which are discussed on page 60. However, we also had to make substantial payments for initial margins and collaterals. Outflows of funds were also registered due to dividend payments to RWE shareholders and minority shareholders.\n\nOn balance, the aforementioned cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities increased our cash and cash equivalents by \u20ac1,051 million.\n\nCash flows from operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestments and asset disposals, results in free cash flow. This amounted to \u20ac4,562 million, up substantially on the prior-year figure (\u20ac1,132 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n| Net assets/uni2009//uni2009net debt 1                           | 31 Dec 2021     | 31 Dec 2020    | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                       |                 |                |                       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                       | 5,825           | 4,774          | 1,051                 |\n| Marketable securities                                           | 8,347           | 4,517          | 3,830                 |\n| Other financial assets                                          | 12,403          | 2,507          | 9,896                 |\n| Financial assets                                                | 26,575          | 11,798         | 14,777                |\n| Bonds, other notes payable, bank debt,   commercial paper       | -/uni200910,704 | -/uni20092,160 | -/uni20098,544        |\n| Hedging of bond currency risk                                   | -/uni20099      | -/uni200931    | 22                    |\n| Other financial liabilities                                     | -/uni20097,090  | -/uni20093,038 | -/uni20094,052        |\n| Financial liabilities                                           | -/uni200917,803 | -/uni20095,229 | -/uni200912,574       |\n| Plus 50/uni2009% of the hybrid capital stated as debt           | 290             | 278            | 12                    |\n| Net financial assets   (including correction of hybrid capital) | 9,062           | 6,847          | 2,215                 |\n| Provisions for pensions and similar obligations                 | -/uni20091,934  | -/uni20093,864 | 1,930                 |\n| Surplus of plan assets over benefit obligations                 | 459             | 172            | 287                   |\n| Provisions for nuclear waste management                         | -/uni20096,029  | -/uni20096,451 | 422                   |\n| Provisions for dismantling wind farms                           | -/uni20091,198  | -/uni20091,136 | -/uni200962           |\n| Net assets (+)/uni2009//uni2009net debt (-)                     | 360             | -/uni20094,432 | 4,792                 |",

Our net debt declined by \u20ac4,792 million versus the previous year (\u20ac4,432 million). As a result of this, we posted a net asset position of \u20ac360 million as of 31 December 2021. The main reason for this was the excellent free cash flow. The marketdriven increase in the discount rates we use to calculate the present value of pension obligations also played a role, as it resulted in a decline in provisions for pensions. A similar effect was exerted by the income generated from managing the plan assets for our pension obligations. While the aforementioned extraordinary funding of these assets in the amount of \u20ac1,092 million caused provisions to decline, it was coupled with a corresponding outflow of funds and thus did not result in a reduction of debt. Dividend payments lowered our net financial position by \u20ac730 million.\n\nLeverage factor below zero. One of our key management parameters is the ratio of net debt to the adjusted EBITDA of the core business, also referred to as the leverage factor. This figure is more indicative than total liabilities, as it also reflects earning power and therefore our ability to meet our debt obligations. We set the upper limit for the leverage factor at 3.0 in order to secure our financial flexibility. As the RWE Group did not have any net debt as of the balance-sheet date and posted a net asset position, this indicator was below zero. However,  the leverage factor should increase in the medium term, above all due to growth investments in our green core business, which we will also finance using debt capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nModerate decline in off-balance-sheet fuel purchase obligations. Net debt does not include our off-balance-sheet obligations, which largely stem from long-term purchase agreements for fuel and electricity. As of the balance-sheet date, our payment obligations from material fuel procurement contracts amounted to \u20ac22.3 billion (previous year: \u20ac23.6 billion). In relation to electricity procurement, they amounted to \u20ac7.1 billion and were thus as high as in 2020. The figures are based on assumptions regarding the prospective development of commodity prices. Our purchase commitments rose from \u20ac2.1 billion to \u20ac5.6 billion over the course of the year. Further off-balance-sheet obligations result, inter alia, from liabilities for pension commitments that employees of our former subsidiary innogy had earned at RWE up to its IPO in 2016.\n\n## Sharp increase in balance-sheet total due to temporary effects from commodity\n\nderivatives. At 31 December 2021, the Group balance sheet was strongly influenced by changes in commodity derivatives. They rose by \u20ac56.4 billion on the assets side and \u20ac68.2 billion on the liabilities side. This was driven by the extreme increase in prices of electricity and natural gas. The increase in these derivatives was the main reason that the balance-sheet total of \u20ac142.3 billion was more than twice as high as in 2020 (\u20ac61.6 billion). Another reason for this development was that we raised a large amount of debt capital. Among other things, the funds were used to collateralise derivative transactions, which resulted in a corresponding build-up of receivables. At \u20ac17.0 billion, our equity was slightly below last year's level. The equity ratio amounted to 11.9/uni2009%. Due to the increase in the balance-sheet total, this figure was significantly lower compared to 2020 (28.7/uni2009%).",

In sum, the profit transfers of these companies recorded an increase in 2021. This was contrasted by an impairment recognised for a subsidiary. We posted positive developments in other income and expenses as well as in net interest. Overall, RWE AG's earnings position has therefore improved: at \u20ac1,108 million, RWE AG's net profit was substantially higher than in 2020. We intend to raise the dividend and will therefore propose a payment of \u20ac0.90 per share to the Annual General Meeting taking place in April 2022. This constitutes an increase of \u20ac0.05 versus last year.\n\n| Balance sheet of RWE AG (abridged) \u20ac million        | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Assets                                              |               |               |                       |\n| Financial assets                                    | 17,866        | 20,524        | -/uni20092,658        |\n| Accounts receivable from affiliated companies       | 7,922         | 2,094         | 5,828                 |\n| Other accounts receivable and other assets          | 616           | 519           | 97                    |\n| Marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents | 11,709        | 6,664         | 5,045                 |\n| Total assets                                        | 38,113        | 29,801        | 8,312                 |\n| Equity and liabilities                              |               |               |                       |\n| Equity                                              | 8,359         | 7,826         | 533                   |\n| Provisions                                          | 2,245         | 1,996         | 249                   |\n| Accounts payable to affiliated companies            | 18,743        | 18,905        | -/uni2009162          |\n| Other liabilities                                   | 8,766         | 1,074         | 7,692                 |\n| Total equity and liabilities                        | 38,113        | 29,801        | 8,312                 |\n\n| Income statement of RWE AG (abridged)   | 2021         | 2020         | +/uni2009//uni2009-   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| \u20ac million                               |              |              |                       |\n| Income from financial assets            | 378          | 1,114        | -/uni2009736          |\n| Net interest                            | 318          | -/uni200972  | 390                   |\n| Other income and expenses               | 132          | -/uni2009712 | 844                   |\n| Taxes on income                         | 280          | 250          | 30                    |\n| Net profit                              | 1,108        | 580          | 528                   |\n| Transfer to other retained earnings     | -/uni2009499 | -/uni20095   | -/uni2009494          |\n| Distributable profit                    | 609          | 575          | 34                    |\n\nFinancial statements in accordance with German commercial law. RWE AG prepares its financial statements in compliance with the rules set out in the German Commercial Code and the German Stock Corporation Act. The financial statements are submitted to Bundesanzeiger Verlag GmbH, located in Cologne, Germany, which publishes them in the Federal Gazette. They are available on the internet at www.rwe.com/financial-reports.\n\nAssets. RWE AG had \u20ac38.1 billion in total assets as of 31 December 2021 (previous year: \u20ac29.8 billion). Accounts receivable from affiliated companies registered a significant rise. This was mainly because we made cash and cash equivalents available to our subsidiary RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading as collateral for commodity forward transactions. We also posted significant increases in 'marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents' and 'other liabilities'. In the year under review, we increased our liabilities significantly by way of bank loans, commercial paper and green bonds. These funds were, inter alia, used to secure liquidity, with a portion thereof, e./uni2009g. the proceeds generated by bonds issued, earmarked for growth investments. RWE AG's equity rose by \u20ac533 million to \u20ac8,359 million. However, the equity ratio decreased from 26.3/uni2009% to 21.9/uni2009%, due to the increase in the balance sheet total.\n\n5",

RWE AG is set up solidly in economic terms with high levels of cash and cash equivalents and a number of financing tools at its disposal that it can use flexibly. Accordingly, rating agencies Moody's and Fitch classify our creditworthiness as 'investment grade'. Last year, they both raised our respective credit rating by one level to Baa2 (Moody's) and BBB+ (Fitch). You can find detailed information on RWE's financial situation and on our financing activities in the year under review on pages 60 et seqq.\n\nEarnings position. RWE AG's earnings position improved compared to 2020. The main items on the income statement developed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Income from financial assets dropped by \u20ac736 million to \u20ac378 million. One reason for this was an impairment loss recognised in relation to our stake in RWE Power. However, this company's profit transfer was higher than in 2020, which was attributable to improved generation margins and lower charges resulting from impairments, depreciation and amortisation. RWE Nuclear also gained considerable ground. This was due to the compensation we received from the German government for the nuclear phaseout (see page 36). By contrast, income from our stake in RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading decreased.\n- \u00b7  Net interest increased by \u20ac390 million to \u20ac318 million. This was in part due to a rise in capital gains from the management of plan assets used to cover our pension obligations and was further boosted by interest claims relating to tax refunds for earlier assessment periods.\n- \u00b7  The 'other income and expenses' line item improved by \u20ac844 million to \u20ac132 million. In the year under review, we recognised write-backs for financial accounts receivable from a Dutch subsidiary. This reversed impairments in previous years to some extent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n- \u00b7  In 2021, we recorded tax income of \u20ac280 million (previous year: \u20ac250 million). This is largely due to the aforementioned tax refunds for earlier assessment periods.\n- \u00b7  Versus 2020 (\u20ac580 million), the presented earnings figures led to a considerably higher net profit of \u20ac1,108 million.\n- \u00b7  The distributable profit of \u20ac609 million corresponds to the planned payment of a dividend of \u20ac0.90 per share to our shareholders.\n\nOutlook for 2022. RWE AG's earnings prospects will largely depend on the business performance of its subsidiaries. Our current assessment makes us confident that we will achieve a net profit in 2022 that offers the necessary margins for the intended dividend of \u20ac0.90. However, it is unlikely to match the level achieved in 2021.\n\nCorporate governance declaration in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code. On 15 February 2022, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of RWE AG issued its Corporate Governance Declaration in accordance with Sections 289f and 315d of the German  Commercial Code. The declaration contains the Corporate Governance Report and has been published at www.rwe.com/corporate-governancedeclaration.",

As things stand, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac3.6 billion to \u20ac4.0 billion. Our core business is expected to close fiscal 2022 up on last year's earnings, which had been heavily impacted by the extreme weather conditions in Texas. The commissioning of new generation capacities is set to have a positive effect. We also expect to see improved electricity margins and better wind conditions. After last year's extraordinarily successful energy trading performance, we anticipate income to normalise. Not yet included in our forecast is the fallout of the Ukraine conflict, which is difficult to assess. How events unfold and how sanctions against Russia affect European energy supply may have a significant impact on our business.\n\nUkraine crisis puts economic growth at risk. Forecasts concerning the economic development in our core markets are linked to considerable uncertainties related to the Ukraine conflict. Estimates available when the combined review of operations was written had been compiled before the war broke out. Based on these figures, world economic output could increase by about 4/uni2009% in 2022. Growth rates forecast for the Eurozone, Germany and the USA are of a similar order, while those for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are expected to reach 3/uni2009%. Should energy prices remain extremely high due to the Ukraine conflict, then the economy may well prove to be less dynamic.\n\nRise in electricity consumption anticipated. Higher economic output is generally associated with additional demand for electricity. However, this is contrasted by continued energy savings which will probably have a slightly dampening effect. Provided the aforementioned economic prognoses prove to be accurate, demand for electricity in our key markets Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA should be between 1/uni2009% and 3/uni2009% higher than in 2021.\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Our power production for 2022 has already largely been sold forward. Wholesale\n\nelectricity prices rose considerably last year, surging again in early 2022 due to the Ukraine conflict. Their development during the current year is impossible to predict, but market fluctuations would only have a moderate impact on this year's generation margins as we have already largely sold forward our electricity production for 2022 and hedged the prices of the required fuel and CO 2 emission allowances. These transactions have been concluded up to three years ahead, and already reflect the rise in electricity prices in 2021 to a limited extent.  A large portion of electricity generated by RWE wind farms, where revenue is marketdependant, has also already been sold forward.\n\n| Forecast \u20ac million                                | 2021 actual   | Outlook for 2022              |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                   | 3,650         | 3,600/uni2009 - /uni20094,000 |\n| of which:                                         |               |                               |\n| Core business                                     | 2,761         | 2,900/uni2009 - /uni20093,300 |\n| of which:                                         |               |                               |\n| Offshore Wind                                     | 1,110         | 1,350/uni2009 - /uni20091,600 |\n| Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar                | 258           | 650/uni2009-/uni2009800       |\n| Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas | 731           | 700/uni2009 -  900            |\n| Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading                    | 769           | 150/uni2009 - /uni2009350     |\n| Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear                      | 889           | 650/uni2009 - /uni2009750     |\n| Adjusted EBIT                                     | 2,185         | 2,000/uni2009 - /uni20092,400 |\n| Adjusted net income                               | 1,569         | 1,300/uni2009 - /uni20091,700 |",

        "page_content": "To our investors\n\n2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\n3\n\nOutlook\n\n2022 adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac3.6 billion to \u20ac4.0 billion expected. Subject to the risks associated with the Ukraine conflict, which are difficult to gauge, we expect this year's business performance to pick up where we left off in terms of our good operating result in 2021. We forecast adjusted EBITDA for the Group of \u20ac3,600 million to \u20ac4,000 million (previous year: \u20ac3,650 million) for 2022 and envisage a range of \u20ac2,900 million to \u20ac3,300 million in the core business, thus exceeding last year's figure (\u20ac2,761 million) which had been heavily burdened by an extreme cold snap in Texas in February 2021. We assume the commissioning of new wind and solar farms and higher electricity margins to have a positive effect on earnings. Moreover, we expect to see average wind speeds, which would improve the utilisation of our wind farms compared to 2021, which was a low-wind year. By contrast, we may well fall short of the very good result achieved in the energy trading business last year. We anticipate a decline in EBITDA outside of the core business, i./uni2009e. in the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment, due to decommissioning of generation capacities, in particular the closure of the Gundremmingen C nuclear power station as of 31 December 2021.\n\nBased on anticipated operating depreciation and amortisation of approximately \u20ac1,600 million, adjusted EBIT should range between \u20ac2,000 million and \u20ac2,400 million (last year: \u20ac2,185 million). Net income, which excludes major exceptional effects, is expected to total between \u20ac1,300 million and \u20ac1,700 million (last year: \u20ac1,569 million). We explain how this key figure is calculated on page 58.\n\nOur outlook broken down by segment is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Offshore Wind: Adjusted EBITDA in this business is forecast to total between \u20ac1,350 million and \u20ac1,600 million (last year: \u20ac1,110 million). We expect the full commissioning of the Triton Knoll wind farm to play an important part. In addition, the first full consolidation of the Rampion wind farm for the year as a whole is also likely to have a positive effect. Furthermore, we anticipate higher margins than last year and expect utilisation of our assets to improve due to the weather.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n- \u00b7 Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar: Our prognosis for this segment is adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac650 million to \u20ac800 million, clearly surpassing last year's level (\u20ac258 million). The main contributing factor will be the non-recurrence of the one-off burden due to the cold snap in Texas in 2021. In addition, we anticipate higher generation volumes due to the commissioning of new generation capacity and more favourable wind conditions. Higher generation margins will also help earnings to rise. This will be contrasted by an increase in expenditure on the development of growth projects. Furthermore, last year's result included capital gains on the sale of majority stakes in Texan wind farms, which will not recur.\n- \u00b7 Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas: Here, we forecast adjusted EBITDA of \u20ac700 million to \u20ac900 million. Therefore, the segment stands a good chance of closing 2022 up on last year's figure (\u20ac731 million). Higher margins on electricity forward sales will play a significant role. Moreover, we expect capital gains from the sale of a former power plant site in the United Kingdom. Conversely, income from the commercial optimisation of power plant dispatch may well fall short of the high level achieved in 2021. Payments from the British capacity market will also decline. An unscheduled outage at the Dutch Claus C gas-fired power station is also expected to have a negative effect.\n- \u00b7 Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading: Earnings in this segment are difficult to predict due to the high volatility of the trading business. Assuming that business develops normally, adjusted EBITDA should range between \u20ac150 million and \u20ac350 million. In this case, it would be substantially below the unusually high level recorded last year (\u20ac769 million).\n- \u00b7 Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear: Here, we anticipate a decrease in adjusted EBITDA to between \u20ac650 million and \u20ac750 million (last year: \u20ac889 million). The main reason for this is the closure of the Gundremmingen C nuclear power station and five lignite units in 2021. This will be contrasted by positive effects stemming from cost savings.",

In\n\ncomparison to 2021 (\u20ac3,689 million), we plan on substantially increasing our property, plant and equipment and intangible asset investments. Considerable funds will be allocated to building the Kaskasi and Sofia offshore wind farms near Heligoland and in the UK North Sea, respectively. Further investments will be made in wind, solar and battery projects in the USA and Europe as well as the construction of a gas-fired power station at Biblis, which is needed to stabilise the electricity grid. Outside of the core business, in the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment, we plan to spend about \u20ac200 million on property, plant and equipment, mainly to maintain our power stations and opencast mines.\n\nLeverage factor to stay below upper limit of 3.0. One of our key management parameters is the ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of the core business, also referred to as the leverage factor. As explained on page 63, the leverage factor fell below zero in 2021. However, it will probably rise again in the long run. This is largely on account of our planned growth investments, a portion of which we will finance by raising debt capital. It is virtually impossible to make leverage factor forecasts for individual years primarily due to the significant liquidity fluctuations that can result from the collateralisation of commodity forward transactions. Nevertheless in 2022, we anticipate this key performance indicator to be clearly below 3.0, i./uni2009e. the cap we have set for it.\n\nDividend for fiscal 2022. The Executive Board of RWE AG aims to pay a dividend of \u20ac0.90 per share for the 2022 financial year. This corresponds to the dividend that we intend to propose to the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2022 for fiscal 2021.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther information",

Thanks to the predominantly high, stable revenues that can be generated with renewables, not only are we more profitable, we are also more resilient. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given rise to new uncertainties. What this conflict will mean for the energy industry and the development of RWE's business is impossible to predict. The German government's plans to accelerate the phaseout of coal-based power generation also pose a risk and could be associated with significant financial burdens for RWE. However, if framework conditions prove favourable, they also offer us the chance to proceed more quickly towards climate neutrality.\n\nDistribution of risk management tasks at RWE. Responsibility for Group risk management lies with the parent company RWE AG. Its Executive Board monitors and manages the Group's overall risk. In addition, it determines the general risk appetite of RWE and defines upper limits for single risk positions. At the level below the Executive Board, the Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management Department has the task of applying and constantly refining the risk management system. It derives detailed limits for the individual business fields and operating units from the risk caps set by the Executive Board. Its tasks also include checking the identified risks for completeness and plausibility and aggregating them. In so doing, it receives support from the Risk Management Committee, which is composed of the heads of the following five RWE AG departments: (1) Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management (Chair), (2) Finance/uni2009&/uni2009Credit Risk, (3) Accounting, (4) Legal, Compliance/uni2009&/uni2009Insurance, and (5) Strategy/uni2009&/uni2009Sustainability. The Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management Department provides the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board of RWE AG with regular reports on the company's risk exposure.\n\nA number of additional organisational units and committees have been entrusted with risk management tasks:\n\n- \u00b7  Financial risks and credit risks are managed by the Finance/uni2009&/uni2009Credit Risk Department of RWE AG.\n- \u00b7  The Accounting Department ensures that financial reporting is free of material misstatements. It has an accounting-related internal control system for this purpose. A committee consisting of officers from Accounting and other departments of relevance to accounting assists in securing the quality of financial reporting. More detailed information can be found on page 79.\n- \u00b7  Risks from changes in commodity prices are monitored by RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading in so far as they relate to the conventional electricity generation, energy trading and gas businesses. Where these risks relate to the renewable energy business, they are managed by RWE Renewables.\n- \u00b7  Strategies to limit market risks in conventional electricity generation must be approved by the Commodity  Management Committee. This expert panel consists of the CFO of RWE AG, members of the Board of Directors of RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading and a representative of the Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management Department.\n- \u00b7  We also have a committee tasked with mitigating market risks associated with the renewable energy business. The Renewables Commodity Management Committee consists of the CFO of RWE AG, members of the management of RWE Renewables and a representative of the Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management Department.\n\n5",

Internal Audit regularly verifies the quality and functionality of our risk management system. The Executive Board formally establishes the Group's risk bearing capacity. This took place by way of a resolution dated 23 November 2021.\n\nRisk identification and assessment. Risks and opportunities are defined as negative or positive deviations from expected figures. Their management is an integral and continuous part of operating processes. We assess risks every six months, using a bottom-up analysis. We also monitor risk exposure between the regular survey dates. The Executive Board of RWE AG is immediately notified of any material changes. Our executive and supervisory bodies are updated on the Group's risks once a quarter.\n\nOur risk analysis normally covers the three-year horizon of our medium-term plan, but can extend beyond that in individual cases. We measure the potential damage based on the possible effects on net income, liquidity, net debt and/or equity. In doing so, we take hedges into account. We define the potential damage as the deviation from the budgeted figure in question, aggregated over the planning horizon.\n\nWe display the material risks using a matrix (see chart on the right) in which they are categorised by potential damage and probability of occurrence. Risks that share the same cause are aggregated to a single risk, if possible. To clearly assign them to the matrix fields, we have established damage potential thresholds, which are oriented towards the RWE Group's ability to bear risks. They are presented in the table below the matrix. Depending on their position in the matrix, we distinguish between low, medium and high risks. Based on this systematic risk identification, we determine whether there is a need for action and initiate measures to mitigate the risks if necessary.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nFurther information\n\n## RWE AG risk matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Potential damage 1 \u20ac million   | Earnings risks   Potential impact on   net income (X)   | Indebtedness/uni2009//uni2009equity risks Potential impact on liquidity,   net debt and/uni2009//uni2009or equity (Y)   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 8,000 \u2264 X                      | 8,000 \u2264 Y                                               | Category V                                                                                                              |\n| 1,500 \u2264 X < 8,000              | 4,000 \u2264 Y < 8,000                                       | Category IV                                                                                                             |\n| 600 \u2264  X < 1,500               | 2,000 \u2264 Y < 4,000                                       | Category III                                                                                                            |\n| 300 \u2264  X < 600                 | 1,000 \u2264 Y < 2,000                                       | Category II                                                                                                             |\n| X < 300                        | Y < 1,000                                               | Category I                                                                                                              |\n\n- 1  Aggregated over the planning horizon.",

Depending on their causes, our risks can be divided into seven classes, which are shown in the table. The highest individual risk determines the classification of the risk of the entire risk class. Our classification of risks reflects the situation in early March 2022. It was not possible to predict the impact of the Ukraine conflict at this time. The following changes have been made versus last year's risk classification:\n\n- \u00b7  We adjusted the classification of our regulatory and political risks upwards from 'medium' to 'high'. One reason for this is the plan of the new government coalition, made up of the Social Democrats, the Green Party and the Free Democrats, to accelerate the German coal phaseout without granting the affected companies compensation. Far-reaching EU sanctions against Russia could also have a significant impact on our business.\n- \u00b7  We reclassified our 'other risks' from 'medium' to 'low' because the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic has become more manageable. Previously, we believed our singlelargest other risk was that a reduction in demand for energy caused by the pandemic would cause electricity prices to drop over the long term and we would thus have to recognise impairments for generation assets. Now we feel that this is unlikely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nAs set out earlier, the focus of the risk analysis described in this chapter lies on the threeyear horizon of our medium-term plan. In 2017, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a panel of experts, recommended that companies consider time horizons that go far above and beyond this when identifying and assessing climate-related risks. RWE implements the TCFD proposals. We explain how we do this in our 2021 Sustainability Report, which will be published in April 2022 and will then be available at www.rwe.com/sustainability-report.\n\nIn this section, we provide commentary on the main risks and opportunities we have identified for this and the next two years and explain what measures have been taken to counter the threat of negative developments.\n\n- \u00b7 Market risks. In most of the countries in which we are active, the energy sector is characterised by the free formation of prices. This presents both opportunities and risks. Over the course of the past year, prices quoted in our key European electricity forward markets hit an all-time high. As a result, the earnings prospects of our generation assets became considerably more favourable. If limits are placed on Russian natural gas imports in the long term due to the Ukraine conflict, then energy prices should remain at a high level. However, there is a possibility that the economy will fall into a recession and that electricity prices will drop again.\n\nWith regard to power and gas purchase agreements, if the conditions are not coupled to the development of wholesale prices, there is a risk of having to pay more for the product than we can earn when selling it. This may force us to form provisions to cover this risk. We have identified such a risk inherent in the two contracts we concluded to purchase electricity from the Datteln 4 hard coal-fired power plant in 2005 and 2006. The station was commissioned by energy group Uniper in mid-2020, ten years later than planned. We were unsuccessful in taking legal recourse against the continuation of the agreements. A further legal dispute regarding certain contractual provisions with Uniper is still pending.",

What the Ukraine crisis will mean for this contract remains to be seen. We have the option to negotiate contractual changes depending on market conditions during price reviews, should it remain effective. In the past, this has enabled us to mitigate our earnings risk exposure from the contract.\n\nWe assess the price risks to which we are exposed on the procurement and supply markets taking account of current forward prices and expected volatility. For our power plants and parts of our renewable energy portfolio, we limit the earnings risks by selling a large portion of the electricity forward. Whenever we need fuel and CO 2 emission allowances to produce power, we secure the respective prices when we sell the electricity. This makes it easier for us to plan generation margins in coming years. However, if we sell too much electricity forward, we run the risk of having to make expensive purchases on the market to fulfil supply commitments in the event of production outages. An example of such a situation was the extreme cold snap in Texas in February 2021, on which we report on page 43. The consequences of this weather event prompted us to review and optimise our hedging strategy.\n\nWe also use financial instruments to hedge our commodity positions. In the consolidated financial statements, these instruments are inter alia presented through the statement of on-balance-sheet hedges. The same applies to financial instruments serving the purpose of limiting interest rate and currency risks. More detailed information on this can be found on pages 105 and 158 et seqq. in the Notes.\n\nRWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading plays a central role when it comes to managing commodity price risks. It functions as the Group's interface to the global wholesale markets for electricity and energy commodities. On behalf of our power plant companies, RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading markets large portions of our electricity output and purchases the necessary fuel and CO 2 certificates. Since RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading acts as the internal transaction partner it is easier for us to limit the risks associated with price volatility on energy markets. However, the trading transactions are not exclusively intended to reduce risks. In compliance with risk thresholds, the company also takes commodity positions to achieve a profit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nOur risk management system for energy trading is firmly aligned with best practice as applied to the trading businesses of banks. As part of this, transactions with third parties are concluded only if the associated risks are within approved limits. There are guidelines governing the treatment of commodity price risks and associated credit risks. Our subsidiaries constantly monitor their commodity positions. Risks associated with trades conducted by RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading for its own account are monitored daily.\n\nThe Value at Risk (VaR) is of central importance for risk measurement in trading. It specifies the maximum loss from a risk position not exceeded with a predetermined probability over a predefined period of time. The RWE Group's VaR figures are generally based on a confidence interval of 95/uni2009% and a holding period of one day. This means that, with a probability of 95/uni2009%, the daily loss will not exceed the VaR.\n\nThe VaR for the price risks of commodity positions in the trading business should not exceed a certain daily cap. In the past, this upper limit was initially set at \u20ac40 million, but was increased by \u20ac10 million at the beginning of 2021 and again in early 2022. In the period under review, the actual amounts averaged \u20ac32 million. The daily maximum was \u20ac50 million. In addition, limits derived from the respective VaR thresholds have been set for every trading desk. Furthermore, we develop extreme scenarios and factor them into stress tests, determine their impact on earnings, and take countermeasures if we deem the risks to be too high.\n\nThe management of our gas portfolio and the liquefied natural gas (LNG) business is pooled in a dedicated organisational unit at RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading. During the past year, the daily VaR cap for these activities was raised from \u20ac14 million to \u20ac25 million. We used a maximum of \u20ac22 million of this headroom. The average VaR for the year was \u20ac8 million.\n\nThe massive price spikes recently observed in energy trading could continue due to the Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless, our market risks remain unchanged in the 'medium' category.",

Most countries in which we are active have set their sights on ambitious climate protection goals. A number of them, including Germany, have recently introduced more stringent objectives. To meet these targets, they will need to continue to improve the framework for renewable energy and green hydrogen. For companies such as RWE, which have designed their business model around the energy transition, this is associated with opportunities for growth.  At the same time, our ambitious carbon-reduction strategy has meant that regulatory interventions to improve climate protection are no longer associated with such high risks.\n\nNevertheless, changes to political and regulatory frameworks can severely impact us. The Ukraine crisis, in particular, is currently associated with risks. For example, there is the possibility that Russian commodities suppliers are no longer able to meet their obligations due to the sanctions against Russia, forcing us to procure these commodities on the market at high prices. It cannot be ruled out that contractual partners become insolvent because of the sanctions. Moreover, in core markets such as Germany, politicians could intervene with regulatory measures to secure energy supply and stabilise consumer prices. It is not yet possible to foresee what effects this could have on RWE.\n\nA core component of Germany's climate protection strategy is reducing coal-fired electricity generation to zero by 2038. In exchange for closing our lignite assets early, we are due \u20ac2.6 billion in compensation, which is still pending approval under EU state aid law. There is now talk of the exit roadmap being expedited. Germany's new government has announced that it ideally wants electricity generation from coal to end as early as 2030 and that it does not intend to grant affected companies any additional compensation. This would impose considerable financial burdens on RWE. However, the accelerated coal phaseout also presents us with opportunities as it presupposes more favourable framework conditions for the construction of environmentally friendly replacement plants, while the expansion of renewables would also have to be ramped up. This would benefit the implementation of our growth strategy. Moreover, the government might pay us compensation after all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nWe are also exposed to risks associated with the coal phaseout in the Netherlands, where a law was passed in 2019 that prevents us from using hard coal in Amer 9 and Eemshaven as of 2025 and 2030, respectively. There are no plans to offer compensation. We accept the coal phaseout, but do not believe it is just that the law does not provide for any remuneration for this intervention in companies' property rights. Given the lack of concessions by Dutch policymakers, we have submitted an application for arbitration proceedings in accordance with the Energy Charter Treaty with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Washington. We hope this will give us the opportunity to receive financial compensation. In addition to the coal phaseout, the Netherlands introduced a cap on coal firing in power plants, which will apply from 2022 to 2024. We are likely to be awarded compensation in relation to this measure, however it is not yet clear how much it will be. Furthermore, the EU Commission will still need to approve it under state aid law.\n\nAlthough the renewable energy business is characterised by fairly stable framework conditions and wide public acceptance, political uncertainties exist in this area as well. Adjustments to state subsidy schemes may result in reductions in payments and new projects losing their appeal. This can lead to investment undertakings being broken off. It is also conceivable that firmly pledged state payments may be cut retrospectively. In the dialogue we maintain with policymakers, we point out that companies which invest in building sustainable, climate- friendly energy infrastructure need reliable framework conditions.\n\nEven in the present regulatory environment, we are exposed to risks associated with, for instance, approvals for constructing and operating production facilities. This particularly affects our opencast mines, power stations and wind farms. The danger here is that approvals are granted late or not at all and that granted approvals are withdrawn temporarily or for good. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the courts will legislatively prohibit the transfer of land that has been assigned to us in the vicinity of our opencast mines.",

RWE also utilises this financial mechanism. The Federal government, however, intends to reform the legal basis for these benefits in accordance with the EU's guidelines on climate and environmental protection and state aid for energy. There is a risk that the new rules will be more restrictive and that we will possibly either receive lower discounts from 2023, or none at all.\n\nCertain statutory regulations to which we must adhere can be interpreted in various ways and are therefore in need of legal clarification. One example is the regulation which exempts us from paying an apportionment under the Renewable Energy Act (EEG) for electricity that we consume ourselves in our German power stations and opencast mines. However, the legal situation surrounding the regulation is vague, for example with regard to the EEG exemption of leased assets. There is a danger that using this exemption may be limited by Germany's highest court and that back payments may even have to be made for previous years.\n\nAs set out earlier, we have adjusted the assessment of our regulatory and political risks from 'medium' to 'high', which is due to the uncertainties associated with the Ukraine conflict and Germany's coal exit.\n\n- \u00b7 Legal risks. Individual RWE Group companies are involved in litigation and arbitration proceedings due to their operations or M/uni2009&/uni2009A transactions. Out-of-court claims have been filed against some of them. Furthermore, Group companies are directly involved in various procedures with public authorities or are at least affected by their outcomes. To the extent necessary, we have accrued provisions for possible losses resulting from pending proceedings before ordinary courts and arbitration courts.\n\nRisks may also result from exemptions and warranties that we granted in connection with the sale of assets. Exemptions ensure that the seller covers the risks that are identified within the scope of due diligence, the probability of occurrence of which is, however, uncertain. In contrast, warranties cover risks that are unknown at the time of sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nThese hedging instruments are standard practice in sales of companies and equity holdings.\n\nWe currently have low exposure to legal risks. This assessment did not change compared to the previous year.\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risks. RWE operates technologically complex, interconnected generation assets. Damage and outages can weigh heavily on earnings, as seen in 2021 during the severe cold snap in the US state of Texas (see page 43). The recent sharp rise in electricity prices is associated with a higher risk of earnings losses but also presents opportunities should the utilisation of our assets be higher than anticipated. To mitigate these risks, we ensure that our supply commitments are not too high, as we may be forced to buy electricity at a high cost to meet these obligations in case of production outages, for example. Furthermore, we also regularly maintain our facilities and take out insurance policies if economically viable.\n\nWhen production facilities are built and modernised, delays and cost increases can occur, for example due to logistical bottlenecks or inadequate services provided by suppliers. The coronavirus pandemic and international trade conflicts have recently proven to be risk factors. Project delays can cause costs to rise and earnings to be delayed. Furthermore, delays of renewable energy projects can be disadvantageous to the level of subsidies they receive. We counter these risks through circumspect planning and diligent project management.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which has persisted for two years now, continues to expose us to risks, albeit to a manageable extent. As before, deliveries can be delayed. Theoretically, it is also conceivable that the reliable operation of our plants may be jeopardised if a large number of employees goes on sick leave. Thanks to comprehensive preventive measures and forward-looking emergency plans, so far we have been able to keep all major operational processes up and running, and we are confident that we can continue doing so.",

We take care to ensure that our new-build projects and acquisitions satisfy our return requirements. If positive market developments occur after an investment decision has been made, electricity revenue and thus also returns can exceed expectations. However, it is also possible that income achieved through our projects falls short of forecasts and that prices paid for acquisitions prove to be too high retrospectively. We prepare our investment decisions by conducting extensive analyses to try and map the financial and strategic effects as realistically as possible before taking investment decisions. Moreover, RWE has specific accountability provisions and approval processes in place to prepare and implement the decisions.\n\nOur business processes are supported by secure data processing systems. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out a lack of availability of IT infrastructure or a breach in data security. There is also a risk of cyber attacks. The Ukraine crisis may trigger a rise in these sorts of attacks. We limit our IT risks with high security standards, and groupwide cyber security training programmes are designed to mitigate them. In addition, we regularly invest in hardware and software upgrades.\n\nAs in the previous year, we classify our operational risks as 'medium'.\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risks. Interest rates, foreign exchange rates, securities prices and rates of inflation are subject to fluctuations, which can be difficult to predict and can have a major impact on our net worth and earnings.\n\nChanges in interest rates give rise to risks and opportunities in several respects. Market interest rates, for example, can impact our provisions, as they are the point of reference for the discount rates used for determining the net present values of obligations. This means that, all other things being equal, provisions decrease when market interest rates rise and increase when market interest rates fall. On pages 144 et seq. of the Notes, we present the effects of changes in interest rates on the net present values of our pension obligations and on the nuclear and mining provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nRises in market interest rates can lead to reductions in the prices of the securities we hold and vice versa. This primarily relates to fixed-interest bonds. In 2021, we started measuring the price risk using a sensitivity analysis. As of the balance-sheet date, an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would have lowered the value of the bonds on our books by \u20ac28 million.\n\nMoreover, interest rates also determine our financing costs. We measure the possible impact using the Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR), applying a confidence level of 95/uni2009% and a holding period of one year. The average CFaR at RWE AG in 2021 was \u20ac8 million.\n\nChanges to the general price level can also give rise to risks and opportunities. Rising inflation can force us to increase the value of our future obligations and raise provisions. Price increases are particularly detrimental when they are above average in sectors from which we procure products and services for nuclear waste disposal and recultivating opencast mine areas.\n\nWith our focus on the global expansion of renewables, changes in exchange rates may increasingly impact our earnings. Companies which are overseen by RWE AG have their currency risks managed by the parent company. These risks are aggregated to a net financial position for each currency and hedged using currency derivatives if necessary. Our foreign currency risks are measured using sensitivity analyses. In the course of such, we calculate how a 10/uni2009% change in the exchange rate would affect the value of the respective foreign currency position. As of the balance-sheet date, the sum total of the sensitivities amounted to \u20ac0.3 million.\n\nSecurity price fluctuations can have a considerable impact on RWE's financial assets and pension funds. In case of a stock market crisis, for example due to the conflict in Ukraine, we would possibly need to significantly increase our pension provisions in order to compensate our fund assets potentially losing value. We are also exposed to share price risks in relation to our 15/uni2009% stake in E.ON, which had a fair value of \u20ac4.8 billion at the end of 2021.",

        "page_content": "## To our investors\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n2\n\nCombined review of/uni00A0 operations\n\nDevelopment of risks and opportunities\n\nRisks and opportunities from changes in the price of securities are controlled by a professional fund management system. Range of action, responsibilities and controls are set out in internal guidelines which the Group companies are obliged to adhere to when concluding financial transactions. All financial transactions are recorded using special software and are monitored by RWE AG.\n\nCollateral pledged for forward transactions also harbours a risk. The amount of the payments - variation margins in the case of exchange transactions - depends on the extent to which the contractually agreed prices deviate from market quotations as of the respective cut-off date. If differences are substantial, then they may weigh heavily on our liquidity. As set out on page 38 et seq., wholesale prices of electricity, natural gas and CO 2 emission allowances spiked substantially in 2021. This forced us to pay unusually high variation margins for electricity forward sales. Thanks to our robust financial position and use of financing instruments at our disposal, we were always able to provide the required funds. Another positive factor was that we received significant margin payments in relation to forward sales of commodities, in particular of CO 2 emission allowances.\n\nThe conditions at which we finance our debt capital are in part dependent on the credit ratings we receive from independent rating agencies. As set out on page 61, Moody's and Fitch place our creditworthiness in the investment grade category. If our rating deteriorates, we may incur additional costs if we have to raise debt capital. This would probably also increase the liquidity requirement when pledging collateral for forward transactions. However, we believe that such a scenario is unlikely. Just last year, Moody's and Fitch raised our credit score by one notch to Baa2 and BBB+, respectively, both with a stable outlook. In doing so, they rewarded us for our transformation into a leading renewable energy company through which we have become more financially robust.\n\nThe assessment of our creditworthiness by rating agencies, banks and capital investors depends in part on the level of our net debt. Our goal is to ensure that, in the medium term, it does not exceed three times the adjusted EBITDA of our core business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nDespite this, net debt could temporarily be above budget, for instance if we have to pay high variation margins. Nevertheless, we are confident that we can keep our indebtedness below the cap.\n\nDespite the significant increase in volatility on commodity markets, we continue to classify our financial risks as 'medium'.\n\n- \u00b7 Creditworthiness of business partners. Our business relations with key accounts, suppliers, trading partners and financial institutions expose us to credit risks. Therefore, we track the creditworthiness of our partners closely and assess their credit standing based on internal and external ratings, both before and during the business relationship. Transactions that exceed a certain size and all trading transactions are subject to credit limits, which we determine before the transaction is concluded and adjust if necessary, for instance in the event of a change in the business partner's creditworthiness. At times, we request cash collateral or bank guarantees. In the trading and financing business, credit risks and the utilisation of the limits are measured daily. We agree on collateral when concluding over-the-counter trading transactions. Furthermore, we enter into framework agreements, e./uni2009g. those of the European Federation of Energy Traders. For financial derivatives, we make use of the German master agreement for forward financial transactions or the master agreement of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.\n\nThe significant price spikes on commodity markets have increased the danger of transaction partners being unable to meet their obligations. The Ukraine crisis has further exacerbated this risk, in particular in relation to trading with Russian commodities producers. This exposes us to substantial financial losses especially with regard to contracts that are particularly valuable to us. We are monitoring the default risks closely and are assessing counterbalancing measures.\n\nAlthough our risks stemming from the creditworthiness of our business partners have increased overall, they still do not exceed the 'medium' category.",

This is the class in which we record the potential effects of damage to our reputation, compliance infringements and criminal acts. The risk of a COVID-19-driven decrease in electricity prices which may force us to recognise impairments for generation assets has also been recorded in this category. However, we now believe it is very unlikely that this will come to pass. Therefore, we have lowered the category of other risks from 'medium' to 'low'.\n\nRWE's risks and opportunities: General assessment by management. Shifting our generation portfolio from fossil fuels to renewables has improved RWE's opportunity-risk profile. By aiming to be carbon neutral by 2040, we are demonstrating that we want to expedite the decarbonisation of the energy sector, thereby increasing our acceptance among politicians, capital lenders, customers and other stakeholder groups. At the same time, our solid financial management ensures that our company remains on a safe course. By analysing the effects of risks on our liquidity and pursuing a conservative financing strategy, we ensure that we can meet our payment obligations punctually. We have considerable liquid funds and great leeway in terms of debt financing, thanks to the Debt Issuance Programme, the Commercial Paper Programme and the syndicated credit line (see page 60). We budget our liquidity with foresight, based on the short, medium and long-term financing needs of our Group companies, and always hold a significant amount of minimum liquidity.\n\nAs shown by the commentary in this chapter, we consider unfavourable changes to the political and regulatory framework to be our biggest risk. Due to the war in Ukraine, developments are conceivable that could have a considerable negative impact on us. We are monitoring events closely as they unfold and are trying to limit these risks as much as possible. We could also become exposed to significant financial burdens due to the accelerated coal phaseout. We therefore class the political and regulatory risks as 'high'. In the previous year, we had classed them as 'medium'. That being said, we also see opportunities here. For example, we are confident that an earlier German coal exit would\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nbe associated with improved framework conditions for the expansion of renewables and for the creation of environmentally friendly backup assets. The additional investments and the steeper climb towards reducing emissions should again increase our acceptance among capital lenders and customers. It is also possible that the government may offer fair compensation regulations, contrary to early statements.\n\nThe booming commodity markets presents us with opportunities. If wholesale electricity prices remain high, renewable energy assets that do not receive fixed payments will achieve additional revenue. This also holds true for our conventional power stations as long as additional earnings are not offset by higher costs of fuel and CO 2 allowances. However, high electricity prices also increase the potential for greater earnings shortfalls in the event of unscheduled plant outages. Price hikes on the energy markets could also see the funds needed to collateralise forward contracts rise at short notice. The same applies to income generated by these contracts. As a result, standards on our liquidity management would become stricter and the risk of our contracting parties being unable to make payments would rise.\n\nRWE has been affected by COVID-19 to a limited extent so far, and we are confident that this will not change. Projects may still be delayed owing to the pandemic. However, the risk of a sustained COVID-19-induced economic crisis resulting in a reduction in electricity prices and impairments to power stations has not materialised. In view of the latest economic recovery and the record energy prices, we now find that such a scenario is unlikely.\n\nThanks to the measures for safeguarding our financial and earning power over the long term and our comprehensive risk management system, we are confident that we can manage our current risks. At the same time, we are establishing the prerequisites for ensuring that this remains the case in the future. Overall, we do not currently foresee any risks that would undermine the viability of RWE AG or the RWE Group.",

Our financial reporting is exposed to the risk of misrepresentations that could have a significant influence on the decisions made by their addressees. For example, stated earnings that are too high can cause capital investors to invest in a company. Capital market law regulations and RWE's Code of Conduct require that we inform the public of our business performance and important company specific events completely, objectively, accurately, clearly and in a timely manner. We use a series of tools to meet this ambition. Examples of this are our IFRS accounting regulation and the high minimum standards to which we subject the IT systems used to record and process accounting-related data. Furthermore, we use an accountingrelated Internal Control System (ICS) for quality assurance purposes. The ICS aims to detect potential errors and misrepresentations that result from non-compliance with accounting standards. The Accounting Department of RWE AG is responsible for designing the ICS and reviewing its effectiveness. In doing so, it applies groupwide rules. In addition, it receives assistance from the ICS Committee, the objective of which is to ensure that the ICS is applied throughout the Group following uniform principles and meeting high ambitions in terms of correctness and transparency. The Committee consists of representatives from the Accounting, Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management and Internal Audit/uni2009&/uni2009Security Departments, along with officers from the human resources, procurement, trading, finance, taxes and IT functions, which are highly relevant to accounting.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nWe subject the ICS to a comprehensive review every year. First, we examine whether the risk situation is presented appropriately and whether suitable controls are in place for the identified risks. Then, we test the effectiveness of the controls. If the ICS reviews pertain to accounting-related processes, e./uni2009g., to the preparation of financial statements or to consolidation, they are conducted by employees from the Accounting Department. When it comes to processes handled by service centres on our behalf, for example invoice processing, an auditor certifies the appropriateness and effectiveness of the controls. The representatives of the finance, human resources, procurement, trading, and IT functions document whether the agreed ICS quality standards are adhered to by their respective areas. Our Internal Audit/uni2009&/uni2009Compliance Department also oversees the ICS reviews. The results of the reviews are documented in a report to the Executive Board of RWE AG. The review conducted in 2021 once again demonstrated that the ICS is effective.\n\nWithin the scope of external reporting, the members of the Executive Board of RWE AG take an initial half-year and a full-year balance-sheet oath, confirming that the prescribed accounting standards have been adhered to and that the financial statements give a true and fair view of the net worth, financial position and earnings. When in session, the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee regularly concerns itself with the effectiveness of the ICS. Once a year, the Executive Board of RWE AG submits a report on this to the Committee.",

The information relates to company-specific regulations, for example relating to adjustments to the capital structure by the Executive Board or a change of control of the company. At RWE, these provisions are in line with the standards of German listed companies.\n\nComposition of subscribed capital. RWE AG's capital stock amounts to \u20ac1,731,123,322.88. It is divided among 676,220,048 no-par-value bearer shares.\n\nLimitation of voting rights or share transfers and employee share schemes. One share grants one vote at the Annual General Meeting and determines the proportion of the company's profit to which the shareholder is entitled. This does not apply to RWE AG's treasury stock, which does not confer any rights to the company. Voting rights are excluded by law in cases where Section 136 of the German Stock Corporation Act applies.\n\nWithin the scope of an employee share plan, we issued 288,624 RWE shares to our employees in Germany in the financial year that just ended. The beneficiaries may only freely dispose of the shares after 31 December 2022.\n\nRWE also has employee share schemes in the United Kingdom. Participating companies are RWE Generation UK plc, RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading GmbH UK Branch and RWE Technology UK Limited. In 2021, employees purchased a total of 23,181 RWE shares under the UK schemes. These shares are also subject to a restriction on disposal, which lasts five years from the grant date.\n\nEmployees can exercise the control rights conferred on them from the employee shares in the same manner as other shareholders can whilst in compliance with statutory regulations and the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.\n\nShares in capital accounting for more than 10/uni2009% of voting rights and special rights with control powers. As of 31 December 2021, no holding in RWE AG exceeded 10/uni2009% of the voting rights. There are no RWE shares with special rights that confer control powers.\n\nAppointment and dismissal of Executive Board members/uni2009//uni2009amendments to the Articles of Incorporation. Executive Board members are appointed and dismissed in accordance with Sections 84 et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act in conjunction with Section 31 of the German Co-Determination Act. Amendments to the Articles of Incorporation are made pursuant to Sections 179 et seqq. of the German Stock Corporation Act in conjunction with Article 16, Paragraph 5 of the Articles of Incorporation of RWE AG. According to the aforementioned provision in the Articles of Incorporation, unless otherwise required by law or the Articles of Incorporation, the Annual General Meeting shall adopt all resolutions by a simple majority of the votes cast or - if a capital majority is required - by the simple majority of the capital stock represented when the resolution is passed. Pursuant to Article 10, Paragraph 9 of the Articles of Incorporation, the Supervisory Board is authorised to pass resolutions in favour of amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that only concern formal matters, without having a material impact on the content.\n\n## Executive Board authorisation to implement issuances and buybacks of RWE shares.\n\nOn 28 April 2021, the Annual General Meeting authorised the Executive Board to increase the company's capital stock subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board by up to \u20ac346,224,663.04 through the issuance of up to 135,244,009 bearer shares (authorised capital). The authorisation is limited to five years and expires on 27 April 2026.\n\n5",

To enable the issuance of shares to holders of convertible and/uni2009//uni2009or option bonds, the Annual General Meeting of 28 April 2021 conditionally increased the company's capital stock by up to \u20ac173,112,330.24, divided into up to 67,622,004 registered or bearer shares (conditional capital).\n\nNew shares from authorised capital and the aforementioned bonds may be issued in exchange for contributions in cash or in kind. These shares must generally be tendered to the shareholders for subscription. However, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to waive subscription rights in the following cases:\n\n- \u00b7  to avoid fractions of shares resulting from the subscription rate;\n- \u00b7  if the issuance is conducted in exchange for contributions in kind;\n- \u00b7  to provide protection from dilution in connection with convertible and/uni2009//uni2009or option bonds that have already been issued; and\n- \u00b7  if the issue price of the new shares or bonds is not significantly below their quotation or their theoretical fair value calculated by generally accepted methods of quantitative finance and if waived subscription rights are limited to no more than 10/uni2009% of the capital stock.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nIn sum, shares issued from authorised capital with a waiver of subscription rights and in connection with convertible or option bonds may not exceed 10/uni2009% of the capital stock. The aforementioned upper limit is defined by the amount of capital stock at the time the resolution providing the authorisation is adopted or when the authorisation is exercised, if the capital stock is lower. Other measures taken waiving subscription rights count towards the upper limit.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of 26 April 2018 authorised the Executive Board of RWE AG, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to purchase shares in the company accounting for up to 10/uni2009% of the capital stock when the resolution is passed or when the authorisation is exercised, if the latter is lower at that time. At the Executive Board's discretion, the purchase can be made on the stock exchange or via a public offer.\n\nShares acquired in this manner may be used for all purposes described in the authorisation. Shareholder subscription rights may be waived depending on the purpose for which the shares are used.\n\nEffects of a change of control on debt financing. Our debt financing instruments often contain clauses that take effect in the event of a change of control. Such a provision is in place e./uni2009g. in respect of our \u20ac5 billion syndicated credit line, and essentially means that in the event of a change of control or majority at RWE AG, drawings are suspended until further notice. The lenders shall enter into negotiations with us on a continuation of the credit line. The time limit for doing this is 30 days from the notification of the change of control. On expiry of the time limit, lenders who are not satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations may revoke their loan commitment or cancel the loan if it has already been paid out, requesting immediate repayment.",

In the event that a change of control is announced or implemented, investors may request that their bonds be redeemed by a certain deadline, if RWE's long-term credit rating falls below investment grade due to the change of control or the rating agencies stop issuing us a credit rating. A similar rule applies to the senior bond that matures in 2037, a small portion of which remained on our books as it could not be fully transferred to innogy in 2016.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, we can redeem our two subordinated hybrid bonds with volumes of \u20ac282 million and US$317 million within the determined change-of-control period.

Unless specified otherwise, all amounts are stated in millions of euros (\u20ac million). Due to calculation procedures, rounding differences may occur.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared for the fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December 2021.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nNotes\n\nThe Executive Board of RWE AG is responsible for the preparation, completeness and accuracy of the consolidated financial statements and the Group review of operations, which is combined with the review of operations of RWE AG.\n\nWe employ internal control systems, uniform groupwide directives, and programmes for basic and advanced staff training to ensure that the consolidated financial statements and combined review of operations are adequately prepared. Compliance with legal regulations and the internal guidelines as well as the reliability and viability of the control systems are continuously monitored throughout the Group.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the German Corporate Control and Transparency Act (KonTraG), the Group's risk management system enables the Executive Board to identify risks at an early stage and take countermeasures, if necessary.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements, the combined review of operations, and the independent auditors' report are discussed in detail by the Audit Committee and at the Supervisory Board's meeting on financial statements with the independent auditors present.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nIn addition to RWE AG, the consolidated financial statements contain all material German and foreign companies which RWE AG controls directly or indirectly. In determining whether there is control, in addition to voting rights, other rights in company, inter-company, consortial and management contracts and potential voting rights are also taken into consideration.\n\nMaterial associates are accounted for using the equity method, and principal joint arrangements are accounted for using the equity method or as joint operations.\n\nAssociates are companies on which RWE AG exercises a significant influence on the basis of voting rights of 20/uni2009% up to and including 50/uni2009% or on the basis of contractual agreements.",

Of these, Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited, UK, is a material joint operation of the RWE Group. Greater Gabbard holds a 500 MW offshore wind farm, which RWE operates together with Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) Renewables Holdings. RWE owns 50/uni2009% of the shares and receives 50/uni2009% of the power generated (including green power certificates). The wind farm is part of the Offshore Wind segment.\n\nFirst-time consolidation and deconsolidation generally take place when control is obtained or lost.\n\nSales of shares which led to a change of control resulted in sales proceeds from disposals amounting to \u20ac186 million, which were reported in other operating income (previous year: \u20ac13 million). Furthermore, in the previous year a deconsolidation gain of \u20ac154 million on the sale of discontinued operations was recognised in the 'income from discontinued operations' line item on the income statement.",

In early November 2020, RWE completed the acquisition of 100/uni2009% of the shares in the companies NXD HOLDCO B.V. and NXD France SAS and thus gained control of the European development operations of the wind turbine manufacturer Nordex. Since then, the names of the acquired companies have been changed to RWE Renewables HoldCo B.V. and RWE Renouvelables France SAS.\n\nThe status at initial consolidation is presented in the following table as at 31 December 2020:\n\n| Balance-sheet items \u20ac million   | IFRS carrying  amounts (fair value)  at initial consolidation  (as at 31 Dec 2020)   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-current assets              | 329                                                                                  |\n| Current assets                  |                                                                                      |\n| Non-current liabilities         | 56                                                                                   |\n| Current liabilities             | 6                                                                                    |\n| Net assets                      | 267                                                                                  |\n| Purchase price                  | 375                                                                                  |\n| Goodwill                        | 108                                                                                  |\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nNotes\n\nAn update of the figures reported during first-time consolidation was performed during the period under review and resulted in the following adjustments: Due to better understanding of the fair value of principally operating rights, the fair value of net assets stated upon first-time consolidation was reduced by \u20ac76 million, from \u20ac267 million to \u20ac191 million. As a result, the goodwill recognised upon first-time consolidation increased by \u20ac76 million to \u20ac184 million.\n\nIn the previous year, the acquired operations did not make significant contributions to the Group's revenue and earnings after initial consolidation.\n\nThe purchase price (excluding \u20ac21 million in redeemed shareholder loans) amounted to \u20ac375 million and was paid exclusively in cash and cash equivalents.\n\nShareholding in Rampion Renewables Ltd. increased to 100/uni2009%. On 1 April 2021, RWE acquired the roughly 40/uni2009% share in Rampion Renewables Limited ('RRL'), UK, which had been held by E.ON until then. Consequently, RWE obtained control over RRL and its subsidiary Rampion Offshore Wind Limited, in which RRL holds a 50.1/uni2009% stake. As a result of the transaction, RWE became the majority owner of the UK offshore wind farm Rampion, which has been fully consolidated since 1 April 2021. This transaction does not represent the acquisition of a business in the sense of IFRS 3 and resulted in an increase of \u20ac1,010 million in property, plant and equipment and of \u20ac1,105 million in intangible assets. There was no effect on earnings. The purchase price for the approximately 40/uni2009% share in RRL was already paid in December 2020. The 400-MW wind farm is located off the coast of Sussex and has been operating commercially since 2018.",

        "page_content": "2\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nThe financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the scope of the Group's financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies. On principle, subsidiaries whose fiscal years do not end on the Group's balance-sheet date (31 December) prepare interim financial statements as of this date. Two subsidiaries have a different balance-sheet date of 31 March (previous year: three). Different fiscal years compared to the calendar year stem from tax-related reasons or country-specific regulations.\n\nBusiness combinations are reported according to the acquisition method. This means that capital consolidation takes place by offsetting the purchase price, including the amount of the non- controlling interests, against the acquired subsidiary's revalued net assets at the time of acquisition. In doing so, the non-controlling interests can either be measured at the prorated value of the subsidiary's identifiable net assets or at fair value. The subsidiary's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at full fair value, regardless of the amount of the non-controlling interests. Intangible assets are reported separately from goodwill if they are separable from the company or if they stem from a contractual or other right. In accordance with IFRS 3, no new restructuring provisions are recognised within the scope of the purchase price allocation. If the purchase price exceeds the revalued prorated net assets of the acquired subsidiary, the difference is capitalised as goodwill. If the purchase price is lower, the difference is included in income.\n\nIn the event of deconsolidation, the related goodwill is derecognised with an effect on income. Changes in the ownership share which do not alter the ability to control the subsidiary are recognised without an effect on income. By contrast, if there is a change in control, the remaining shares are remeasured at fair value with an effect on income.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\nNotes\n\nExpenses and income as well as receivables and payables between consolidated companies are eliminated; intra-group profits and losses are eliminated.\n\nFor investments accounted for using the equity method, goodwill is not reported separately, but rather included in the value recognised for the investment. In other respects, the consolidation principles described above apply analogously. If impairment losses on the equity value become necessary, we report such under income from investments accounted for using the equity method. The financial statements of investments accounted for using the equity method are also prepared using the Group's uniform accounting policies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn their individual financial statements, the companies measure non-monetary foreign currency items at the balance-sheet date using the exchange rate in effect on the date they were initially recognised. Monetary items are converted using the exchange rate valid on the balance-sheet date. Exchange rate gains and losses from the measurement of monetary balance-sheet items in foreign currency occurring up to the balance-sheet date are recognised on the income statement.\n\nFunctional foreign currency translation is applied when converting the financial statements of companies outside of the Eurozone. As the principal foreign enterprises included in the consolidated financial statements conduct their business activities independently in their national currencies, their balance-sheet items are translated into euros in the consolidated financial statements using the average exchange rate prevailing on the balance-sheet date. This also applies for goodwill, which is viewed as an asset of the economically autonomous foreign entity. We report differences to previous-year translations in other comprehensive income without an effect on income. Expense and income items are translated using annual average exchange rates. When translating the adjusted equity of foreign companies accounted for using the equity method, we follow the same procedure.",

With the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets have finite useful lives and are amortised using the straight-line method. Useful lives and methods of amortisation are reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nSoftware for commercial and technical applications is amortised over three to five years. 'Operating rights' refer to the entirety of the permits and approvals required for the operation of a power plant. Such rights are generally amortised over the economic life of the power plant, using the straight-line method. Capitalised customer relations are amortised over a maximum period of up to 18 years.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nGoodwill is not amortised; instead it is subjected to an impairment test once every year, or more frequently if there are triggers for an impairment.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if a newly developed product or process can be clearly defined, is technically feasible and it is the company's intention to either use the product or process itself or market it. Furthermore, asset recognition requires that there be a sufficient level of certainty that the development costs lead to future cash inflows. Capitalised development costs are amortised over the period during which the products are expected to be sold. Research expenditures are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for an intangible asset if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. A special regulation applies for cases when the asset is part of a cash-generating unit. Such units are defined as the smallest identifiable group of assets which generates cash inflows; these inflows must be largely independent of cash inflows from other assets or groups of asset. If the intangible asset is a part of a cashgenerating unit, the impairment loss is calculated based on the recoverable amount of this unit. If goodwill was allocated to a cash-generating unit and the carrying amount of the unit exceeds the recoverable amount, the allocated goodwill is initially written down by the difference. Impairment losses which must be recognised in addition to this are taken into account by reducing the carrying amount of the other assets of the cash-generating unit on a prorated basis. If the reason for an impairment loss recognised in prior periods has ceased to exist, a write-back to intangible assets is performed. The increased carrying amount resulting from the write-back may not, however, exceed the amortised cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.",

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the asset's cost, if they are incurred directly in connection with the acquisition or production of a 'qualified asset'. What characterises a qualified asset is that a considerable period of time is required to prepare it for use or sale. If necessary, the cost of property, plant and equipment may contain the estimated expenses for the decommissioning of plants or site restoration. Maintenance and repair costs are recognised as expenses.\n\nWith the exception of land and leasehold rights, as a rule, property, plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method, unless in exceptional cases another depreciation method is better suited to the usage pattern. The depreciation methods are reviewed annually. We calculate the depreciation of RWE's typical property, plant and equipment according to the following useful lives, which apply throughout the Group and are also reviewed annually:\n\n|                                       | Useful life in years   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Buildings                             | 7/uni2009-/uni200950   |\n| Technical plants                      |                        |\n| Thermal power plants                  | 6/uni2009-/uni200940   |\n| Wind turbines                         | Up to 25               |\n| Gas and water storage facilities      | 10/uni2009-/uni200960  |\n| Mining facilities                     | 3/uni2009-/uni200925   |\n| Other renewable generation facilities | 5/uni2009-/uni200950   |\n\nIn relation to lignite mining and generation, the decommissioning data from the Act on Coal Phaseout are taken into consideration in determining the useful life spans.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment also include right-of-use assets resulting from leases of which RWE is the lessee. These right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost results from the present value of the lease instalments, adjusted to take into account advance payments, initial direct costs and potential dismantling obligations and corrected for\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nreceived lease incentives. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term or the expected useful life, whichever is shorter.\n\nFor short-term leases and leases for low-value assets, lease instalments are recognised as an expense over the lease term. For operating leases of which RWE is the lessor, the minimum lease instalments are recognised as income over the lease term.\n\nImpairment losses and write-backs on property, plant and equipment are recognised according to the principles described for intangible assets.\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method are initially accounted for at cost and thereafter based on the carrying amount of their prorated net assets. The carrying amounts are increased or reduced annually by prorated profits or losses, dividends and all other changes in equity. Goodwill is not reported separately, but rather included in the recognised value of the investment. Goodwill is not amortised. An impairment loss is recognised for investments accounted for using the equity method, if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount.\n\nThe initial measurement of other financial assets occurs at the settlement date. Shares in non- consolidated subsidiaries and in associates or joint ventures are recognised at fair value through profit or loss insofar as such can be determined reliably. Other investments are also recognised at fair value, insofar as such can be determined reliably. The option to state changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is exercised for some of these equity instruments. Non-current securities are also accounted for at fair value and changes in value are recognised through profit or loss or other comprehensive income depending on their classification. Gains and losses on sales of equity instruments, for which the option to state changes in fair value in other comprehensive income is exercised, remain in equity and are not reclassified to the income statement. An impairment in the amount of the expected credit losses is recognised through profit or loss for debt instruments that are recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income. The changes reported in other comprehensive income are recognised with an effect on earnings upon the sale of these instruments.",

Aside from financial derivatives, receivables and other assets are stated at amortised cost minus a risk provision in the amount of the expected losses.\n\nLoans reported under financial receivables are stated at amortised cost minus a risk provision in the amount of the expected losses. Loans with interest rates common in the market are shown on the balance sheet at nominal value; as a rule, however, non-interest or low-interest loans are disclosed at their present value discounted using an interest rate commensurate with the risks involved.\n\nCO 2 emission allowances and certificates for renewable energies are accounted for as intangible assets and reported under other assets; both are stated at cost and are not amortised.\n\nDeferred taxes result from temporary differences in the carrying amount in the separate IFRS financial statements and tax bases, and from consolidation procedures. Deferred tax assets also include tax reduction claims resulting from the expected utilisation of existing loss carryforwards in subsequent years. Deferred taxes are capitalised if it is sufficiently certain that the related economic advantages can be used. Their amount is assessed with regard to the tax rates applicable or expected to be applicable in the specific country at the time of realisation. The tax regulations valid or adopted as of the balance- sheet date are key considerations in this regard. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted out for each company and/uni2009//uni2009or tax group.\n\nInventories are assets which are held for sale in the ordinary course of business (finished goods and goods for resale), which are in the process of production (work in progress - goods and services) or which are consumed in the production process or in the rendering of services (raw materials including nuclear fuel assemblies and excavated earth for lignite mining).\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nInsofar as inventories are not acquired primarily for the purpose of realising a profit on a short-term resale transaction, they are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Production costs reflect the full costs directly related to production; they are determined based on normal capacity utilisation and, in addition to directly allocable costs, they also include adequate portions of required materials and production overheads. They also include production- related depreciation. Borrowing costs, however, are not capitalised as part of the cost. The determination of cost is generally based on average values. The usage of excavated earth for lignite mining is calculated using the 'first in - first out' method (FIFO).\n\nIf the net realisable value of inventories written down in earlier periods has increased, the reversal of the write-down is recognised as a reduction of the cost of materials.\n\nNuclear fuel assemblies are stated at amortised cost. Depreciation is determined by operation and capacity, based on consumption and the reactor's useful life.\n\nInventories which are acquired primarily for the purpose of realising a profit on a short-term resale transaction are recognised at fair value less costs to sell. Changes in value are recognised with an effect on income.\n\nSecurities classified as current marketable securities essentially consist of fixed-interest securities which have a maturity of more than three months and less than one year from the date of acquisition. Securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income. The transaction costs directly associated with the acquisition of these securities are included in the initial measurement, which occurs on their settlement date. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised through profit or loss or other comprehensive income, with due consideration of any deferred taxes depending on the underlying measurement category. An impairment in the amount of the expected credit losses is recognised through profit or loss for debt instruments that are stated at fair value through other comprehensive income. Changes included in other comprehensive income are recognised through profit or loss on disposal of such instruments.",

Such assets may be certain non-current assets, asset groups ('disposal groups') or operations ('discontinued operations'). Liabilities intended to be sold in a transaction together with assets are a part of a disposal group or discontinued operations, and are reported separately under Liabilities held for sale .\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are no longer depreciated or amortised. They are recognised at fair value less costs to sell, as long as this amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nGains or losses on the valuation of specific assets held for sale and of disposal groups are stated under income from continuing operations until final completion of the sale. Gains or losses on the valuation of discontinued operations and on certain assets of a discontinued operation, which are not subject to the valuation rules pursuant to IFRS 5, are stated under income from discontinued operations.\n\nThe stock option plans granted by RWE to executives and corporate bodies are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payment . At the balance-sheet date, a provision is recognised in the amount of the prorated fair value of the payment obligation. Changes in the fair value are recognised with an effect on income. The fair value of options is determined using generally accepted valuation methodologies.\n\nProvisions are recognised for all legal or constructive obligations to third parties which exist on the balance-sheet date and stem from past events which will probably lead to an outflow of resources, and the amount of which can be reliably estimated. Provisions are carried at their prospective settlement amount and are not offset against reimbursement claims. If a provision involves a large number of items, the obligation is estimated by weighting all possible outcomes by their probability of occurrence (expected value method).\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nAll non-current provisions are recognised at their prospective settlement amount, which is discounted as of the balance-sheet date. In the determination of the settlement amount, any cost increases likely to occur up until the time of settlement are taken into account.\n\nIf necessary, the cost of property, plant and equipment may contain the estimated expenses for the decommissioning of plants or site restoration. Decommissioning, restoration and similar provisions are recognised for these expenses. If changes in the discount rate or changes in the estimated timing or amount of the payments result in changes in the provisions, the carrying amount of the respective asset is increased or decreased by the corresponding amount. If the decrease in the provision exceeds the carrying amount, the excess is recognised immediately through profit or loss.\n\nAs a rule, releases of provisions are credited to the expense account on which the provision was originally recognised.\n\nProvisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognised for defined benefit plans. These are obligations of the company to pay future and ongoing post-employment benefits to entitled current and former employees and their surviving dependents. In particular, the obligations refer to retirement pensions. Individual commitments are generally oriented to the employees' length of service and compensation.\n\nProvisions for defined benefit plans are based on the actuarial present value of the respective obligation. This is measured using the projected unit credit method. This method not only takes into account the pension benefits and benefit entitlements known as of the balance-sheet date, but also anticipated future increases in salaries and pension benefits. The calculation is based on actuarial reports, taking into account appropriate biometric parameters (for Germany, in particular the 'Richttafeln 2018 G' by Klaus Heubeck, and the Standard SAPS Table S2PA of the respective year for the United Kingdom, taking into consideration future changes in mortality rates). The provision derives from the balance of the actuarial present value of the obligations and the fair value of the plan assets. The service cost is disclosed in staff costs.

They remain outside profit or loss in subsequent periods as well.\n\nIn the case of defined contribution plans, the enterprise's obligation is limited to the amount it contributes to the plan. Contributions to the plan are reported under staff costs.\n\nWaste management provisions in the nuclear energy sector are based on obligations under public law, in particular the German Atomic Energy Act, and on restrictions from operating licenses. These provisions are measured using estimates, which are based on and defined in contracts as well as on information from internal and external specialists (e./uni2009g. experts).\n\nObligations existing as of the balance-sheet date and identifiable when the balance sheet is being prepared are recognised as provisions for mining damage to cover land recultivation and remediation of mining damage that has already occurred or been caused. The provisions must be recognised due to obligations under public law, such as the German Federal Mining Act, and formulated, above all, in operating schedules and water law permits. Provisions are generally fully related to the degree of mining in question. Such provisions are measured at full expected cost or according to estimated compensation payments. Cost estimates are based on external expert opinions to a significant extent.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n## Notes\n\nA provision is recognised to cover the obligation to submit CO 2 emission allowances and certificates for renewable energies to the respective authorities; this provision is primarily measured at the secured forward price of the CO 2 allowances or certificates for renewable energies. If a portion of the obligation is not covered with allowances that are available or have been purchased forward, the provision for this portion is measured using the market price of the emission allowances or certificates for renewable energies on the reporting date.\n\nLiabilities consist of financial liabilities, trade accounts payable, income tax liabilities and other liabilities . Upon initial recognition, these are generally stated at fair value including transaction costs and are carried at amortised cost in the periods thereafter (except for derivative financial instruments). Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the future lease payments. For subsequent measurements, the lease payments are divided into the financing costs and repayment portion of the outstanding debt. Financing costs are distributed over the lease term in such a manner that a steady interest rate is created for the outstanding debt.\n\nIf uncertain income tax items are recognised in income tax liabilities because they are probable, the former are generally measured at the most likely amount. Measurement at expected value is only considered in exceptional cases.\n\nMoreover, other liabilities also include contract liabilities.  A contract liability is the obligation of the Group to transfer goods or services to a customer, for which we have already received consideration or for which the consideration is already due.",

Changes in this value are recognised with an effect on income, unless the instruments are used for hedge accounting purposes. In such cases, recognition of changes in the fair value depends on the type of hedging transaction.\n\nFair value hedges are used to hedge assets or liabilities carried on the balance sheet against the risk of a change in their fair value. The following applies: changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the fair value of the respective underlying transactions are recognised in the same line item on the income statement. Hedges of unrecognised firm commitments are also recognised as fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of the firm commitments with regard to the hedged risk result in the recognition of an asset or liability with an effect on income.\n\nCash flow hedges are used to hedge the risk of variability in future cash flows related to an asset or liability carried on the balance sheet or related to a highly probable forecast transaction. If a cash flow hedge exists, unrealised gains and losses from the hedging instrument are initially stated as other comprehensive income. Such gains or losses are only included on the income statement when the hedged underlying transaction has an effect on income. If forecast transactions are hedged and such transactions lead to the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability in subsequent periods, the amounts that were recognised in equity until this point in time are recognised on the income statement in the period during which the asset or liability affects the income statement. If the transactions result in the recognition of non-financial assets or liabilities, for example the acquisition of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognised in equity without an effect on income are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n## Notes\n\nThe purpose of hedges of a net investment in foreign operations (net investment hedges) is to hedge the currency risk from investments with foreign functional currencies. With the exception of hedging costs, unrealised gains and losses from such hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income until disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nHedging relationships must be documented in detail and meet the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7  there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument,\n- \u00b7  the value change of hedging relationship is not dominated by the credit risk, and\n- \u00b7  the hedge ratio is the same as that resulting from the quantities used within the scope of risk management.\n\nOnly the effective portion of a hedge is recognised in accordance with the preceding rules.

Contingent liabilities are only recognised on the balance sheet if they were assumed within the framework of a business combination. The amounts disclosed in the Notes correspond to the best possible estimate of the settlement amount at the balance-sheet date.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets resulting from past events, the existence of which must be confirmed by future events that are not under the full control of RWE. Contingent assets are not stated in the balance sheet. The volumes reported in the Notes correspond to estimates of the possible financial ramifications as of the balance-sheet date.\n\nAs explained on page 37, renewable energy projects in the USA are primarily subsidised via tax credits and tax benefits (hereinafter referred to jointly as tax items). Within the framework of so-called tax equity financing, tax equity investors participate directly in financing the generation facilities of individual project companies. Due to its financing character, the capital contributed by the tax equity investor is reported under financial liabilities, in the amount of the outstanding repayment.\n\nRepayment of interest and capital for the tax equity liability occurs primarily via the direct allocation of the tax items generated by the project to the tax equity investor, which can then apply the items in relation to its own tax accounting. In addition to this, repayment of interest and capital also occurs in cash.\n\nThe tax equity arrangement and the related obligation to maintain proper operations is treated similar to a contract for services. The income resulting from the tax items is recorded under other operating income, with this income realised using the straight-line method over the anticipated duration of the tax equity contracts. In this regard, linear realisation of the income is capped at the amount of income that will most likely be generated during the contract, and any amounts above and beyond this are only recognised up to the amount of income that is actually generated.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nManagement judgements in the application of accounting policies.\n\nManagement judge-\n\nments are required in the application of accounting policies. In particular, this pertains to the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7  With regard to certain contracts, a decision must be made as to whether they are to be treated as derivatives or as so-called own-use contracts, and be accounted for as executory contracts.\n- \u00b7  Financial assets are classified by contractual cash flows and applied business model. Whereas the contractual cash flows are determined by the characteristics of the financial instruments, the business model is based on the Group's internal requirements relating to the portfolios of financial instruments.\n- \u00b7  With regard to assets held for sale, it must be determined if they can be sold in their current condition and if the sale of such is highly probable in the next twelve months. If both conditions apply, the assets and any related liabilities must be reported and measured as assets or liabilities held for sale, respectively.\n\nManagement estimates and judgements. Preparation of consolidated financial statements pursuant to IFRS requires assumptions and estimates to be made, which have an impact on the recognised value of the assets and liabilities carried on the balance sheet, on income and expenses and on the disclosure of contingent liabilities.\n\nAmongst other things, these assumptions and estimates relate to the accounting and measurement of provisions. With regard to non-current provisions, the discount factor to be applied is an important estimate, in addition to the amount and timing of future cash flows. The discount factor for pension obligations is determined on the basis of yields on high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds on the financial markets as of the balance-sheet date. The new government coalition consisting of the SPD, the Green Party and the FDP wishes to accelerate Germany's phaseout of coal, in the interests of climate protection. 2030 is stated as the desired final date in the coalition agreement. This is eight years earlier than envisaged in the current legal roadmap. The accounting policies continue to be based on the 2038 decommissioning date as foreseen in the current legal regulations.",

Maintaining a solid rating and a positive operating cash flow from continuing activities serve this purpose.\n\nThe management of RWE's capital structure is oriented towards a leverage factor of three or less. This indicator is calculated by adding material non-current provisions, with the exception of mining provisions, to net financial debt and comparing the resulting figure to the adjusted EBITDA of the core business. RWE's liabilities of relevance to net debt primarily consist of (hybrid) bonds, short-term borrowing and provisions for pensions, nuclear waste management and wind farms.\n\nDuring the reporting period, RWE's net debt was mainly influenced by inflows of variation margins on forward transactions with electricity, commodities and CO 2 certificates. Variation margins are payments with which transaction partners mutually collateralise profit and loss positions resulting from the daily revaluation of active contracts. However, their influence on cash flows is temporary and ends once the transactions triggering the payments are realised. Conversely, capital expenditures, in particular on wind and solar power, increased compared to the previous year. In total, net financial assets amounted to \u20ac9.1 billion on 31 December 2021 and were thus higher than at the end of 2020 (previous year: \u20ac6.9 billion). Furthermore, net debt provisions fell by \u20ac2.6 billion to \u20ac8.7 billion (previous year: \u20ac11.3 billion). On average, provisions have a very long duration; their level is primarily determined by external factors such as the general level of interest rates. A precise calculation of net debt/assets and net financial debt/assets is presented on page 62 of the review of operations. In total, as of 31 December 2021, RWE's net assets amounted to \u20ac0.4 billion (previous year: net debt of \u20ac4.4 billion). As of 31 December 2021, the leverage factor was -0.1 (previous year: 1.7) and was thus below the planned ceiling.",

These include aspects such as the amount of cash flows and debt as well as market conditions, competition, and the political framework. Our hybrid bonds also have a positive effect on our rating. The leading rating agency, Moody's, classifies part of hybrid capital as equity.\n\nIn March and April 2021, the rating agencies Fitch and Moody's both raised their credit rating for RWE by one notch. RWE's long-term creditworthiness is now classified as BBB+ (Fitch) and Baa2 (Moody's), with a stable outlook. RWE's short-term credit ratings are P-2 (previous year: P-3) and F1 (previous year: F2), respectively.\n\n## Changes in accounting regulations\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has approved several amendments to existing IFRSs, which are effective for the RWE Group as of fiscal 2021 due to EU endorsement:\n\n- \u00b7  Amendments to IFRS 4: Extension of the Temporary Exemption From Applying IFRS 9 (2020)\n- \u00b7  Amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 4, IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (2020)\n- \u00b7  Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (2021)\n\nThese new regulations do not have any material effects on the RWE Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Changes to the accounting of tax items in relation to tax equity contracts. At the\n\nbeginning of fiscal 2021, the fundamental basis for the accounting of tax items in relation to tax equity financing arrangements was changed. In the new approach, the allocation of tax items to the tax equity investor is accounted for as a process similar to a sales transaction (see also page 106), in order to present the economic peculiarities of the US subsidy system more accurately and thus provide more relevant information regarding the economic and financial consequences of this system.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nEven though a contract similar to contract for services is recognised, IFRS 15 is not directly applicable as a tax equity contract does not fulfil the definition of a contract with a customer in the sense of IFRS 15. Instead, IFRS 15 is applied analogously, as per IAS 8.11 (a). In this analogy, the contractually agreed capital payment is treated as the transaction price, while the maintenance of operations in the interests of generating the tax items to be transferred to the tax equity investor is treated as RWE's performance obligation over time. As a result, all income resulting from the tax items is recognised in other operating income; furthermore, realisation of this income occurs using the straight-line method over the anticipated duration of the tax equity contracts and is thus independent of the actual amount of the tax items generated during the reporting period in question. This method of realising the income results from linear performance over time, i./uni2009e. the amount paid by the tax equity investor is viewed as a transaction price, which is recognised pro-rata over the duration of the relevant tax equity contract.\n\nCompared to the previous accounting method, the approach described above primarily leads to a different accounting treatment of tax benefits, which stem from accelerated depreciation in particular. Previously, these tax benefits were reported in taxes on income, in the amount of the tax benefits that were actually generated. Due to the change in the accounting method, the comparable figures for the previous year were adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, RWE recognised tax benefits totalling \u20ac72 million in other operating income, which would have been reported as \u20ac38 million in taxes on income prior to the change in the accounting policy. The tax benefits recognised in income from investments accounted for using the equity method amount to a total of \u20ac9 million. Prior to the change in the accounting policy, this figure would have been reported as \u20ac7 million under income from investments accounted for using the equity method.",

Revenue resulting from the commercial optimisation of generation dispatch is based on the net sale price, after deduction of the relevant material costs. By contrast, all other revenue from our generation activities and the consumer business is reported on a gross basis.\n\nRevenue contains state subsidies for the sale of green electricity and the refund of such to the state, including subsidies from contracts for differences, amounting to -\u20ac37 million (previous year: \u20ac51 million), which do not meet the definition of IFRS 15. These contracts for differences are used as a state subsidy mechanism within the framework of climate-protection measures and essentially result in a fixed price for the electricity that is sold, by offsetting positive and negative deviations (in so-called two-way contracts for difference) and negative deviations (in so-called one-way contracts for difference) from a defined reference price that is agreed with state contractual partners or the subsidy mechanism counterparty.\n\nIn the year under review, RWE generated external revenue with three large customers in the amount of \u20ac4,683 million, \u20ac2,475 million and \u20ac2,471 million (previous year: two large customers at \u20ac6,963 million and \u20ac1,544 million) in the Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading segment.\n\nDuring the year under review, revenues rose sharply compared to the previous year, in particular due to the steep increase in electricity prices.\n\nA breakdown of revenue by division, geographical region and product is contained in the segment reporting on pages 174 et seqq.\n\nThe item 'natural gas tax/uni2009//uni2009electricity tax' comprises the taxes paid directly by Group companies.",

These impairments were based on lower market prices and impairment tests performed for the cash-generating units Garzweiler, Hambach, Inden and the hard coal-fired power stations (see page 113).\n\nDuring the year under review, the cost of materials rose significantly compared to the previous year, in particular due to the sharp increases in electricity and gas prices.\n\n## (4)  Staff costs\n\n| Staff costs                                          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| \u20ac million                                            |        |        |\n| Wages and salaries                                   | 2,012  | 1,891  |\n| Cost of social security, pensions and other benefits | 490    | 474    |\n|                                                      | 2,502  | 2,365  |\n\n| Number of employees                              | 2021                 | 2021                       | 2020                 | 2020                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                  | Number of  employees | In  full-time  equivalents | Number of  employees | In  full-time  equivalents |\n| Employees covered by                             |                      |                            |                      |                            |\n| collective agreements and other employees        | 12,994               | 12,754                     | 13,539               | 13,272                     |\n| Employees not covered by   collective agreements | 6,248                | 6,113                      | 6,493                | 6,358                      |\n|                                                  | 19,242               | 18,867                     | 20,032               | 19,630                     |\n\nIn contrast to the previous year, the number of employees and full-time equivalents are reported for the year under review.

As a result of the increase in CO 2 prices, the fair value of these hedges has risen sharply, leading to an improvement in equity (other comprehensive income). Conversely, the value of the lignite-fired plants and opencast mines has declined. The impairment test performed in 2021 in the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment for the Garzweiler cash-generating unit resulted in a write-down of \u20ac729 million on property, plant and equipment (recoverable amount: \u20ac0.1 billion). Additionally, impairments of \u20ac26 million were recognised on property, plant and equipment outside of the Garzweiler cash-generating unit. The Garzweiler cash-generating unit comprises the Niederau\u00dfem (K) and Neurath (F, G) power plant units, which - according to the law on coal phaseout - will remain online over the long term, and the Garzweiler opencast mine, along with the refining plants.

Of these impairments, \u20ac579 million was related to the Garzweiler cash-generating unit (recoverable amount: \u20ac0.8 billion), \u20ac114 million to the Hambach cash-generating unit (recoverable amount: -/uni2009\u20ac0.7 billion) and \u20ac98 million to the Inden cash-generating unit (recoverable amount: -/uni2009\u20ac0.4 billion).\n\nAdditionally, in the previous year impairments of \u20ac231 million were recognised on property, plant and equipment of the hard coal-fired power stations in the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment (recoverable amount: \u20ac0.0 billion), in relation to the phaseout of hard coal in Germany.\n\nOther impairments on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were recognised primarily on the basis of cost increases and changes in price expectations.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n## (6)  Other operating expenses\n\n| Other operating expenses \u20ac million                                                                                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Maintenance and renewal obligations                                                                                               | 538    | 499    |\n| Additions to provisions/uni2009//uni2009reversals                                                                                 | 419    | 48     |\n| Structural and adaptation measures                                                                                                | 57     | 12     |\n| Legal and other consulting and data processing services                                                                           | 322    | 301    |\n| Disposal of current assets and decreases in values   (excluding decreases in the value of inventories and  marketable securities) | 18     | 49     |\n| Disposal of non-current assets including expenses from  deconsolidation                                                           | 37     | 32     |\n| Insurance, commissions, freight and similar distribution costs                                                                    | 83     | 82     |\n| General administration                                                                                                            | 49     | 51     |\n| Expenses from derivative financial instruments                                                                                    | 1,125  | 507    |\n| Expenses from leases                                                                                                              | 43     | 30     |\n| Fees and membership dues                                                                                                          | 70     | 56     |\n| Exchange rate losses                                                                                                              | 29     |        |\n| Other taxes (primarily on property)                                                                                               | 48     | 40     |\n| Miscellaneous                                                                                                                     | 243    | 243    |\n|                                                                                                                                   | 3,081  | 1,950  |\n\nRecoverable amounts are generally determined on the basis of fair values less costs to sell; in the Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar segment, they are also determined on the basis of values in use. Fair values are determined using valuation models based on planned cash flows. In the fiscal year, the valuation models were based on discount rates (after taxes) in the range of 2.75/uni2009% to 5.00/uni2009% (previous year: 2.75/uni2009% to 4.50/uni2009%). Our key planning assumptions relate to the development of wholesale prices of electricity, crude oil, natural gas, coal and CO 2 emission allowances, market shares and regulatory framework conditions. Based on the use of internal planning assumptions, the determined fair values are  assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n5\n\n## Further information",

In the previous year, goodwill declined by \u20ac8 million due to the deconsolidation of Georgia Biomass in the Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas cash-generating unit.\n\nIn the third quarter of every fiscal year, an impairment test is performed to determine if there is any need to write down goodwill. In doing so, goodwill is allocated to the cashgenerating units.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined, which is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use. Fair value is the best estimate of the price that an independent third party would pay to purchase the cash-generating unit as of the balance-sheet date. Value in use reflects the present value of the future cash flows which are expected to be generated with the cash-generating unit.\n\nFair value less costs to sell is assessed from an external perspective and value in use from a company- internal perspective. Values are determined using a business valuation model, based on planned future cash flows. These cash flows, in turn, are based on the medium- and long-term business plans, as approved by the Executive Board and valid at the time of the impairment test. They pertain to a detailed planning period of three to ten years. The cash flow plans are based on experience as well as on expected market trends in the future. If available, market transactions in the same sector or third-party valuations are taken as a basis for determining fair value. Based on the use of internal planning assumptions, the determined fair values are assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe medium- and long-term business plans are based on country-specific assumptions regarding the development of key economic indicators such as gross domestic product, consumer prices, interest rate levels and nominal wages. These estimates are, amongst others, derived from macro- economic and financial studies.\n\nOur key planning assumptions for the business segments active in electricity and gas markets relate to the development of wholesale prices of electricity, crude oil, natural gas, coal and CO 2 emission allowances, market shares and regulatory framework conditions.",

During the period under review, they were 4.25/uni2009% for the cash-generating unit Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading (previous year: 4.25/uni2009%), 3.75/uni2009% for Offshore Wind (previous year: 4.25/uni2009%), 3.50/uni2009% for Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar (previous year: 3.50/uni2009%) and 4.00/uni2009% for Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas (previous year: 3.75/uni2009%).\n\nIn the cash-generating units Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar, we used a growth rate of 0.50/uni2009% (previous year: 0.50/uni2009%) as a basis for extrapolating future cash flows going beyond the detailed planning period. For all of the other cash-generating units, we do not base the extrapolation of future cash flows going beyond the detailed planning period on growth rates. The growth rate for each segment is generally derived from experience and expectations of the future and does not exceed the long-term average growth rates of the respective markets in which the Group companies are active. The annual cash flows assumed for the years after the detailed planning period include as a deduction capital expenditure in the amount necessary to maintain the scope of business.\n\nAs of the balance-sheet date, the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units, which are determined as the fair value less costs to sell, were higher than their carrying amounts. The surpluses react especially sensitively to changes in the discount rate, the growth rate insofar as such are used in the model - and cash flows in terminal value.\n\nOf all of the cash-generating units, the Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading cash-generating unit exhibited the smallest surplus of recoverable amount over the carrying amounts. The recoverable amount was \u20ac0.7 billion higher than the carrying amount. Impairment would have been necessary if the calculations had used an after-tax discount rate increased by more than 1.25 percentage points to above 5.5/uni2009%, a growth rate reduced by more than 1.4 percentage points to less than -/uni20091.4/uni2009% or cash flows reduced by more than \u20ac105 million in terminal value.\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n5\n\nFurther information",

The company's capital stock was thus increased by 10/uni2009% via the issue of 61,474,549 new bearer shares, under the exclusion of existing shareholders' subscription rights. The new shares were placed with institutional investors at a price of \u20ac32.55 per share in an accelerated bookbuilding process. As a result of the capital increase, in the previous year the subscribed capital of RWE AG rose by \u20ac157,374,845.44 and its paid-in capital rose to \u20ac1,843,621,724.51. Transaction expenses of \u20ac11,070,500.71 were offset against retained earnings in the previous year.\n\nAs the approved capital was partially utilised in this capital increase, the General Meeting passed a resolution to replace the remaining authorisation with new approved capital on 28 April 2021. Pursuant to this resolution, the Executive Board is authorised, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to increase the company's capital stock by up to \u20ac346,224,663.04 - equivalent to approximately 20/uni2009% of the current capital stock until 27 April 2026 through the issue of up to 135,244,009 bearer shares in return for contributions in cash and/or in kind (approved capital).\n\nIn certain cases, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, the subscription rights of shareholders can be excluded.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\nOn 28 April 2021, the General Meeting also decided on a conditional increase of the company's capital stock by up to \u20ac173,112,330.24, divided into up to 67,622,004 bearer shares. This conditional capital increase serves the purpose of granting shares to the holders or creditors of convertible and/uni2009//uni2009or option bonds. It shall only be implemented by 27 April 2026 to the extent that the holders or creditors of convertible and/uni2009//uni2009or option bonds issued on the basis of the resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2021 by the company or a company affiliated with the company within the meaning of Sections 15 et seqq. of the German Stock Corporation Act, in which the company has a direct or indirect stake of at least 90/uni2009%, exercise conversion/uni2009//uni2009option rights, fulfil conversion/uni2009/ option obligations, or shares are tendered and no other forms of fulfilment are used. The Executive Board is authorised, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to determine further details of implementing conditional capital increases.\n\nPursuant to a resolution passed by the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2018, the company was further authorised until 25 April 2023 to acquire shares of the company up to a volume of 10/uni2009% of the capital stock when the resolution on this authorisation was passed, or if the following is lower, when this authorisation is exercised. Based on the authorisation, the Executive Board is authorised to cancel treasury shares without a further resolution by the Annual General Meeting. Moreover, the Executive Board is authorised to transfer or sell such shares to third parties under certain conditions and excluding shareholders' subscription rights. Furthermore, treasury shares may be issued to holders of option or convertible bonds under certain conditions. The Executive Board is also authorised to use the treasury shares to discharge obligations from future employee share schemes; in this regard, shareholders' subscription rights shall be excluded.\n\nNo treasury shares were held as of 31 December 2021, as was also the case at last year's reporting date.\n\nIn fiscal 2021, RWE AG purchased a total of 288,624 RWE shares (previous year: 314,808) for a purchase price of \u20ac9,459,816.32 on the capital market (previous year: \u20ac10,633,444.15). This is equivalent to \u20ac738,877.44 of the capital stock (0.04/uni2009% of subscribed capital) (previous year: \u20ac805,908.48 and 0.05/uni2009% of subscribed capital).

The expenses associated with these are borne by the Group companies which employ the persons holding notional stocks.\n\nThe LTIP SPP 2016-2020 was introduced in 2016. It uses an internal performance target (net income of relevance to remuneration) derived from the mid-term planning and takes into account the development of RWE AG's share price. Executives receive conditionally granted virtual shares (performance shares). The final number of virtual shares in a tranche is determined based on the achievement of the adjusted net income target. Each of the issued LTIP SPP tranches has a term of four years before payment is possible.\n\nThe plan conditions of the LTIP SPP were adjusted and extended for grants starting from fiscal 2021. In the future, along with the development of adjusted net income of relevance to remuneration, the share-based payment scheme LTIP SPP 2021 will orientate to two additional success factors: the carbon footprint of our generation portfolio and the relative total shareholder return, which puts the total return of the RWE share in relation to that of other European utility stocks. These three success factors determine how many of the conditionally granted performance shares are finally granted at the end of the performance period. The performance period was extended from the previous one year to three years. Once it ends, all three success factors will be given equal weight in calculating the final grant. Thereafter, the performance shares must be held for a further year. Therefore, the vesting period will still be four years.\n\n5\n\n## Further information",

The limited payment per SPP was implemented via a sold call option. The option value calculated using the Black Scholes Model was deducted. The maximum payments per conditionally granted SPP (= option strike) established in the plan conditions, the discount rates relative to the remaining term as well as the volatilities and expected dividends of RWE AG were considered in determining the option price.\n\nMultivariate Monte Carlo simulations were used for the valuation of RWE AG's 2021 tranche of the SPP. In this context, the success factors not dependent on the capital market were taken as the best estimators without variability. In the valuation model, due consideration was given to the maximum payment amounts stipulated in the programme's conditions for each conditionally granted SPP (= option strike), the success factors not dependent on the capital market, the current level of the RWE AG share and the index, the volatilities and correlations, the discount rates for the remaining term and the expected dividends of RWE AG.\n\n| Performance Shares from  the RWE AG SPP      | 2017  tranche   | 2018  tranche   | 2019  tranche   | 2020  tranche   | 2021  tranche   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Outstanding at the start of  the fiscal year | 1,643,631       | 1,088,490       | 1,403,532       | 935,331         |                 |\n| Granted                                      |                 |                 |                 |                 | 823,566         |\n| Change 1                                     |                 | -10,609         | -7,973          | 77,820          |                 |\n| Paid out                                     | -1,643,631      |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| Outstanding at the end of  the fiscal year   |                 | 1,077,881       | 1,395,559       | 1,013,151       | 823,566         |\n| Payable at the end of the   fiscal year      |                 | 1,077,881       |                 |                 |                 |\n\nFor the SPP options exercised in the previous fiscal year, the average weighted daily share price on the day of exercise was \u20ac34.51.\n\nDuring the period under review, expenses for the share-based  payment system totalled \u20ac33 million (previous year: \u20ac38 million). As of the balance-sheet date, provisions for cash-settled share- based payment programmes amounted to \u20ac85 million (previous year: \u20ac85 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n5\n\n## Further information",

The defined benefit commitments mainly relate to pension benefits based on final salary. These are exposed to the typical risks of longevity, inflation and salary increases.\n\nIn the reporting period, \u20ac36 million (previous year: \u20ac32 million) was paid into defined contribution plans. This includes payments made by RWE for a benefit plan in the Netherlands which covers the commitments of various employers. This fund does not provide the participating companies with information allowing for the pro-rata allocation of defined benefit obligations, plan assets and service cost. In the consolidated financial statements, the contributions are thus recognised analogously to a defined contribution plan, although this is a defined benefit plan. The pension plan for employees in the Netherlands is administered by Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP (see www.abp.nl). Contributions to the pension plan are calculated as a percentage rate of employees' salaries and are paid by the employees and employers. The rate of the contributions is determined by ABP. There are no minimum funding obligations. Approximately \u20ac9 million in employer contributions are expected to be paid to the ABP pension fund in the following fiscal 2022 (prior-year figure for fiscal 2021: \u20ac9 million). The contributions are used for all of the beneficiaries. If ABP's funds are insufficient, it can either curtail pension benefits and future post-employment benefits, or increase the contributions of the employer and employees. In the event that RWE terminates the ABP pension plan, ABP will charge a termination fee. Amongst other things, its level depends on the number of participants in the plan, the amount of salary and the age structure of the participants. As of 31 December 2021, we had around 600 active participants in the plan (previous year: approximately 600).\n\nRWE transferred assets to RWE Pensionstreuhand e.V. within the framework of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA) in order to finance the pension commitments of German Group companies. There is no obligation to provide further funds. From the assets held in trust, funds were transferred to RWE Pensionsfonds AG to cover pension commitments to most of the employees who have already retired. RWE Pensionsfonds AG falls under the\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\nscope of the Act on the Supervision of Insurance Undertakings and oversight by the Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (BaFin). Insofar as a regulatory deficit occurs in the pension fund, supplementary payment shall be requested from the employer. Independently of the aforementioned rules, the liability of the employer shall remain in place. The boards of RWE Pensionstreuhand e.V. and RWE Pensionsfonds AG are responsible for ensuring that the funds under management are used in compliance with the contract and thus fulfil the requirements for recognition as plan assets. In March 2021, RWE made an extraordinary funding payment of \u20ac1,049 million to the assets held in trust, in order to further improve the capital coverage of the domestic pension obligations.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is legally mandated that defined benefit plans are provided with adequate and suitable assets to cover pension obligations. The corporate pension system is managed by the sector-wide Electricity Supply Pension Scheme (ESPS). Following completion of the E.ON transaction, dedicated independent sections were formed for RWE for the conventional generation business (RWE Section), for the renewables business acquired legally from innogy which has been consolidated with RWE without interruption (Innogy Section) and for the renewables business acquired from E.ON (Former E.ON Section). The sections are managed by trustees which are elected by members of the pension plans or appointed by the sponsoring employers. The trustees are responsible for managing the pension plans. This includes investments, pension payments and financing plans. The pension plans comprise the benefit obligations and plan assets for the subsidiaries of the RWE Group. It is required by law to assess the required financing of the pension plans once every three years in compliance with the UK regulations for pensions (a so-called funding valuation). This involves measuring pension obligations on the basis of conservative assumptions, which deviate from the requirements imposed by IFRS. The underlying actuarial assumptions primarily include the projected life expectancies of the members of the pension plans as well as assumptions relating to inflation, imputed interest rates and the market returns on the plan assets.",

The next funding valuation must occur by 31 March 2022. A financing deficit of \u00a3103.4 million was revealed for the Innogy Section. It was subsequently agreed with the trustees to rectify this deficit with annual payments of \u00a337.5 million, \u00a336.3 million, \u00a317.0 million and \u00a317.0 million from 2020 to 2023. An agreement was also reached with the trustees to draw forward the next valuation to 31 March 2021. This valuation was completed in December 2021. No financing deficit was identified. Together with the trustees, the decision was then made not to undertake the annual payments for 2022 and 2023 resulting from the previous valuation. A valuation was carried out for the section of the renewables business acquired from E.ON on 31 March 2020.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\nIt revealed a financing deficit of \u00a37 million. In December 2021, the sponsoring employers and the trustees decided to transfer the members of this section to the Innogy Section. Consequently, there is no need to settle the financing deficit.\n\nThe payments to settle the deficit are charged to the participating companies on the basis of a contractual agreement. Above and beyond this, payments are regularly made to finance the newly arising benefit obligations of active employees which increase the pension claims.\n\nProvisions for defined benefit plans are determined using actuarial methods.

Using an optimisation process, portfolios are identified which can earn the best targeted results at a defined level of risk. One of these efficient portfolios is selected and the strategic asset allocation is determined; furthermore, the related risks are analysed in detail.\n\nThe focus of RWE's strategic investment policy is on domestic and foreign government bonds. In order to increase the average yield, corporate bonds with a higher yield are also included in the portfolio. The ratio of equities in the portfolio is lower than that of bonds. Investment occurs in various regions. The investment position in equities is intended to earn a risk premium over bond investments over the long term. Furthermore, in order to\n\nachieve consistently high returns, there is also investment in products which are more likely to offer relatively regular positive returns over time. This involves products with returns which fluctuate like those of bond investments, but which achieve an additional return over the medium term, such as so-called absolute return products.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, our capital investment takes account of the structure of the pension obligations as well as liquidity and risk matters. The goal of the investment strategy in this context is to maintain the level of pension plan funding and ensure the full financing of the pension plans over time. To reduce financing costs and earn surplus returns, we also include higher-risk investments in our portfolio. The capital investment focusses on government and corporate bonds.",

Actual developments will probably be different than this. The methods of calculating the aforementioned sensitivities and for calculating the pension provisions are in agreement. The dependence of pension provisions on market interest rates is limited by an opposite effect. The background of this is that the commitments stemming from company pension plans are primarily covered by funds, and mostly plan assets exhibit negative correlation with the market yields of fixed- interest securities. Consequently, declines in market interest rates are typically reflected in an increase in plan assets, whereas rising market interest rates are typically reflected in a reduction in plan assets.\n\nThe present value of pension obligations, less the fair value of the plan assets, equals the net amount of funded and unfunded pension obligations.\n\nAs of the balance-sheet date, the recognised amount of pension provisions totalled \u20ac1,367 million for funded pension plans (previous year: \u20ac3,265 million) and \u20ac567 million for unfunded pension plans (previous year: \u20ac599 million).\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\nDomestic company pensions are subject to an obligation to review for adjustment every three years pursuant to the Act on the Improvement of Company Pensions (Sec 16 of the German Company Pension Act (BetrAVG)). Additionally, some commitments grant annual adjustments of pensions, which may exceed the adjustments in compliance with the legally mandated adjustment obligation.\n\nSome domestic pension plans guarantee a certain pension level, taking into account the statutory pension (total retirement earnings schemes). As a result, future reductions in the statutory pension can result in higher pension payments by RWE.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the pension obligations was 16 years in Germany (previous year: 16 years) and 16 years outside of Germany (previous year: 17 years).\n\nIn fiscal 2022, RWE expects to make \u20ac65 million in payments for defined benefit plans of continuing operations (previous-year target: \u20ac240 million), as direct benefits and contributions to plan assets.\n\nAs in the previous year, a portion of the past service cost related to effects in connection with restructuring measures in Germany and severance payments in Great Britain.\n\n| Provisions for nuclear energy and mining \u20ac million   | Balance at   1 Jan 2021   |   Additions | Unused amounts  released   |   Interest accretion | Amounts used   | Balance at   31 Dec 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| Provisions for nuclear waste management              | 6,451                     |         162 | -/uni20092                 |                   14 | -/uni2009596   | 6,029                      |\n| Provisions for mining damage                         | 4,814                     |         116 | -/uni20092                 |                  127 | -/uni200962    | 4,993                      |\n|                                                      | 11,265                    |         278 | -/uni20094                 |                  141 | -/uni2009658   | 11,022                     |",

Provisions for waste disposal for the Dutch nuclear power plant Borssele are included at a rate of 30/uni2009%, in line with RWE's stake.\n\nProvisions for nuclear waste disposal are almost exclusively reported as non-current provisions, and their settlement amount is discounted to the balance-sheet date. Based on the current state of planning, these provisions will essentially be used by the beginning of the 2040s. The discount rate calculated on the basis of the current level of market interest rates for no-risk cash investments was 0.0/uni2009% as of the balance-sheet date (previous year: 0.0/uni2009%). The escalation rate based on expectations with regard to general increases in wages and prices and productivity growth was 1.5/uni2009% (previous year: 1.5/uni2009%). As a result, the real discount rate used for nuclear waste management purposes, which is the difference between the discount rate and the escalation rate, amounted to -/uni20091.5/uni2009% (previous year: -/uni20091.5/uni2009%). An increase (decrease) in this rate by 0.1 percentage point would reduce (increase) the present value of the provision by roughly \u20ac40 million.\n\nExcluding the interest accretion, additions to provisions for nuclear waste management are based on quantity-related increases in the provisions as well as updates of the cost estimates and amount to \u20ac162 million. Of the changes in provisions, \u20ac21 million was offset against the corresponding costs of nuclear power plants still in operation and the fuel elements. In the reporting period, we also used provisions of \u20ac245 million for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants. Decommissioning and dismantling costs had originally been capitalised in a corresponding amount and reported under the cost of the respective nuclear power plants.\n\nThe provisions of the law on the reassignment of responsibility for nuclear waste disposal stipulate that accountability for the shutdown and dismantling of the assets in Germany as well as for packaging radio active waste remains with the companies. The shutdown and dismantling process encompasses all activities following the final termination of production by the nuclear power plant until the plant site is removed from the regulatory scope of the Nuclear Energy Act. A request to decommission and dismantle the nuclear power plant will be filed with the nuclear licensing authority during its operating period so that the decom-\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\nmissioning and dismantling work can be performed in time after the expiry of the operating permit. Dismantling operations essentially consist of dismantling and removal of the radioactive contamination from the facilities and structures, radiation protection, and regulatory monitoring of the dismantling measures and residual operations.\n\nWe thus subdivide our provisions for nuclear waste management into the residual operation of nuclear power plants, the dismantling of nuclear power station facilities as well as the cost of residual material processing and radioactive waste treatment facilities.\n\n| Provisions for nuclear waste  management             | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| \u20ac million                                            |               |               |\n| Residual operation                                   | 2,211         | 2,707         |\n| Dismantling                                          | 2,126         | 2,007         |\n| Processing of residual material and waste management | 1,692         | 1,737         |\n|                                                      | 6,029         | 6,451         |\n\nProvisions for the residual operation of nuclear power station  facilities cover all steps that must be taken largely independent of dismantling and disposal but are necessary to ensure that the assets are safe and in compliance with permits or are required by the authorities.

They also consider the conventional dismantling of nuclear power plant facilities to fulfil legal or other obligations.\n\nProvisions for residual material processing and waste management include the costs of processing radioactive residual material for non-hazardous recycling and the costs of treating radioactive waste produced during the plant's service life and dismantling operations.

This item also contains the cost of transporting the waste produced by recycling and of the proper packaging of spent nuclear fuel elements, i./uni2009e. the cost of procuring and loading freight and interim storage containers.\n\nCommissioned by the plant operator, the internationally renowned company NIS Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, Alzenau, assesses the prospective costs of residual operation and dismantling of the nuclear power plants on an annual basis. The costs are determined specifically for each facility and take into consideration the current state of the art, regulatory requirements and previous practical experience from ongoing and completed dismantling projects. Additionally, current developments are also incorporated into the cost calculations. They also include the cost of conditioning and packaging radioactive waste generated during dismantling operations and the transportation of such waste to BGZ. Further cost estimates for the disposal of radioactive waste are based on contracts with foreign reprocessing companies and other disposal companies.

The obligations include the anticipated residual costs of reprocessing and returning the resulting radioactive waste. These costs stem from existing contracts with foreign reprocessing companies and with GNS. Moreover, these provisions also include the costs for transport and intermediate storage containers for and the loading of spent fuel assemblies within the framework of final direct storage. Furthermore, this item also includes the amounts for the professional packaging of radioactive operational waste as well as the in-house personnel costs incurred for the residual operation of plants which are permanently decommissioned.\n\nProvisions for mining damage also consist almost entirely of non-current provisions and fully covered the volume of obligations as of the balance-sheet date. They are reported at their settlement amount discounted to the balance-sheet date.

The reason for this was quantity-induced increases in the obligatory volume and updates of the cost estimates, of which \u20ac21 million was capitalised in the item The interest accretion increased provisions for mining damage by \u20ac127 million, of which \u20ac6 million was capitalised in the item 'property, plant and equipment'.\n\n| Other provisions                                                                                        | Balance at   1 Jan 2021   | Additions   | Unused amounts  released   | Interest accretion   | Changes in the scope of  consoli dation,   currency   | Amounts used   | Balance at   31 Dec 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                                                               |                           |             |                            |                      | adjustments, transfers                                |                |                            |\n| Staff-related obligations   (excluding restructuring)                                                   | 990                       | 708         | -/uni200925                |                      | 37                                                    | -/uni2009574   | 1,136                      |\n| Restructuring obligations                                                                               | 642                       | 96          | -/uni200964                | -/uni200915          | -/uni200940                                           | -/uni20099     | 610                        |\n| Purchase and sales obligations                                                                          | 1,490                     | 425         | -/uni200977                | -/uni20099           |                                                       | -/uni2009350   | 1,479                      |\n| Provisions for dismantling wind farms                                                                   | 1,136                     | 159         | -/uni2009165               | -/uni2009105         | 175                                                   | -/uni20092     | 1,198                      |\n| Other dismantling and retrofitting obligations                                                          | 718                       | 35          | -/uni200992                | -/uni20099           | 8                                                     | -/uni200913    | 647                        |\n| Environmental protection obligations                                                                    | 78                        | 1           | -/uni20094                 |                      | 3                                                     | -/uni20094     | 74                         |\n| Interest payment obligations                                                                            | 223                       |             |                            |                      |                                                       |                | 223                        |\n| Obligations to deliver CO 2  emission  allowances/uni2009//uni2009  certificates for renewable energies | 1,332                     | 2,095       | -/uni200927                |                      | 20                                                    | -/uni20091,321 | 2,099                      |\n| Miscellaneous other provisions                                                                          | 736                       | 435         | -/uni200941                |                      | -/uni200917                                           | -/uni2009324   | 789                        |\n|                                                                                                         | 7,345                     | 3,954       | -/uni2009495               | -/uni2009138         | 186                                                   | -/uni20092,597 | 8,255                      |",

Based on current estimates, we expect most of these to be used from 2022 to 2025.\n\nProvisions for restructuring obligations pertain mainly to measures for socially acceptable payroll downsizing. We currently expect most of these to be used from 2022 to 2038. In so doing, sums ear-marked for personnel measures are reclassified from provisions for restructuring obligations to provisions for staff-related obligations as soon as the underlying restructuring measure has been specified. This is the case if individual contracts governing socially acceptable payroll downsizing are signed by affected employees.\n\nProvisions for purchase and sales obligations primarily relate to contingent losses from pending transactions.\n\nFrom the current perspective, we expect that the majority of the provisions for the dismantling of wind farms will be used from 2022 to 2046, and the provisions for other dismantling and retrofitting obligations will be used from 2022 to 2060.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n## (23)  Financial liabilities\n\n| Financial liabilities                     | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020   | 31 Dec 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| \u20ac million                                 | Non-  current | Current       | Non-  current | Current       |\n| Bonds payable 1                           | 2,411         |               | 549           |               |\n| Commerical paper                          |               | 2,710         |               |               |\n| Bank debt                                 | 2,014         | 3,569         | 1,528         | 83            |\n| Other financial liabilities               |               |               |               |               |\n| Collateral for trading activities         |               | 4,239         |               | 716           |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 2,373         | 478           | 1,874         | 448           |\n|                                           | 6,798         | 10,996        | 3,951         | 1,247         |\n\nThe following overview shows the key data on the bonds of the RWE Group as of 31 December 2021:\n\n| Bonds payable Issuer   | Outstanding  amount   | Carrying  amount \u20ac million   | Coupon in %   | Maturity      |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| RWE AG                 | \u20ac 12 million          | 12                           | 3.5           | October 2037  |\n| RWE AG                 | \u20ac 282 million 1       | 281                          | 3.5           | April 2075    |\n| RWE AG                 | US$ 317 million 1     | 278                          | 6.625         | July 2075     |\n| RWE AG                 | \u20ac 500 million         | 500                          | 0.625         | June 2031     |\n| RWE AG                 | \u20ac 750 million         | 747                          | 0.5           | November 2028 |\n| RWE AG                 | \u20ac 600 million         | 593                          | 1.0           | November 2033 |\n| Bonds payable          |                       | 2,411                        |               |               |\n\n- 1  Hybrid bonds classified as debt as per IFRS.\n\n5\n\n## Further information",

Based on a coupon of 0.625/uni2009% p.a. and an issue price of 99.711/uni2009%, the yield-to-maturity amounts to 0.655/uni2009% p.a. In accordance with RWE's guidelines for green bonds, the RWE Green Bond Framework, the proceeds from the issue may only be used for the financing or refinancing of wind and solar projects.\n\nRWE issued another green bond in November 2021. It consisted of two tranches, with a volume of \u20ac750 million and a maturity of seven years and a volume of \u20ac600 million and a maturity of twelve years, respectively. Based on a coupon of 0.5/uni2009% p./uni2009a. and an issue price of 99.808/uni2009%, the yield-to-maturity amounts to 0.528/uni2009% p./uni2009a.  for  the  first  tranche.  The  yield-  tomaturity is 1.077/uni2009% p./uni2009a. for the second tranche, with a coupon of 1.0/uni2009% and an issue price of 99.138/uni2009%.\n\nIn the previous year, a hybrid bond issued by RWE AG which was previously classified as debt pursuant to IAS 32 was cancelled on 4 September 2020. The redemption in the amount of \u20ac539 million was effected on 21 October 2020 without refinancing the hybrid bond with fresh hybrid capital. The hybrid bond had a 2.75/uni2009% coupon and maturity ending in April 2075.\n\n\u20ac23 million of the financial liabilities are secured by mortgages (previous year: \u20ac31 million). Other financial liabilities contain lease liabilities.\n\n## (24)  Income tax liabilities\n\nIncome tax liabilities contain uncertain income tax items in the amount of \u20ac905 million (previous year: \u20ac939 million).

Non-derivative financial assets essentially include other non-current financial assets, accounts receivable, marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents. Financial instruments are recognised either at amortised cost or at fair value, depending on their classification. Financial instruments are recognised in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7  Debt instruments measured at amortised cost: the contractual cash flows solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital: there is an intention to hold the financial instrument until maturity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nNotes\n\n- \u00b7  Debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the contractual cash flows solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital; there is an intention to hold and sell the financial instrument.\n- \u00b7  Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income: the option to recognise changes in fair value directly in equity is exercised.\n- \u00b7  Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss: the contractual cash flows of a debt instrument do not solely consist of interest and principal on the outstanding capital or the option to recognise changes in the fair value of equity instruments in other comprehensive income is not exercised.\n\nOn the liabilities side, non-derivative financial instruments principally include liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are measured based on the published exchange price, insofar as the financial instruments are traded on an active market. The fair value of non-quoted debt and equity instruments is generally determined on the basis of discounted expected payment flows, taking into consideration macro-economic developments and corporate business plan data. Current market interest rates corresponding to the remaining maturity are used for discounting.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are recognised at their fair values as of the balance-sheet date, insofar as they fall under the scope of IFRS 9. Exchange-traded products are measured using the published closing prices of the relevant exchange. Non-exchange traded products are measured on the basis of publicly available broker quotations or, if such quotations are not available, on generally accepted valuation methods. In doing so, we draw on prices on active markets as much as possible. If such prices are not available, companyspecific planning estimates are used in the measurement process. These estimates encompass all of the market factors which other market participants would take into account in the course of price determination.

We limit these risks via systematic, groupwide risk management. The range of action, responsibilities and controls are defined in binding internal directives.\n\nMarket risks stem from changes in exchange rates and share prices as well as interest rates and commodity prices, which can have an influence on business results.\n\nDue to the RWE Group's international profile, currency management is a key issue. Fuels are traded in British pounds and US dollars as well as in other currencies. In addition, RWE does business in a number of currency areas. The companies of the RWE Group are required to hedge their foreign currency risks via RWE AG. Foreign currency risks arising from the involvement in and the financing of the renewable energy business are hedged by RWE Renewables International Participations B.V.\n\nInterest rate risks stem primarily from financial debt and the Group's interest-bearing investments. We hedge against negative changes in value caused by unexpected interest-rate movements using non-derivative and derivative financial instruments.\n\nOpportunities and risks from changes in the values of non-current securities are centrally controlled by a professional fund management system operated by RWE AG.\n\nThe Group's other financial transactions are recorded using centralised risk management software and monitored by RWE AG.\n\nFor commodity operations, risk management directives have been established by RWE AG's Controlling/uni2009&/uni2009Risk Management Department. These regulations stipulate that derivatives may be used to hedge price risks. Furthermore, commodity derivatives may be traded, subject to limits. Compliance with limits is monitored daily.\n\nRisks stemming from fluctuations in commodity prices and financial market risks (foreign currency risks, interest rate risks, securities risks) are monitored and managed by RWE using\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\nindicators such as the Value at Risk (VaR) and sensitivities, amongst other things. In addition, for the management of interest rate risk, a Cash Flow at Risk (CFaR) is determined.\n\nUsing the VaR method, RWE determines and monitors the maximum expected loss arising from changes in market prices with a specific level of probability during specific periods. Historical price volatility is taken as a basis in the calculations. With the exception of the CFaR data, all VaR figures are based on a confidence interval of 95/uni2009% and a holding period of one day. For the CFaR, a confidence interval of 95/uni2009% and a holding period of one year is taken as a basis.\n\nIn respect of interest rate risks, RWE distinguishes between two risk categories: on the one hand, increases in interest rates can result in declines in the prices of securities from the holdings of RWE. This pertains primarily to fixed-rate instruments. Starting from fiscal 2021, price risk is measured using sensitivity analysis in relation to an interest rate change of 100 basis points. As of the balance- sheet date, it amounted to \u20ac28.2 million (previous year: \u20ac2.5 million). On the other hand, financing costs also increase along with the level of interest rates. The sensitivity of interest expenses to increases in market interest rates is measured with the CFaR. As of 31 December 2021 this amounted to \u20ac2.0 million (previous year: \u20ac18.6 million). RWE calculates the CFaR based on the assumption of the refinancing of maturing debt.\n\nStarting from fiscal 2021, risks related to financial positions in foreign currency are also measured using sensitivity analysis, which shows the impact on the value of the position stemming from a 10/uni2009% change in the exchange rate. As of 31 December 2021, this sensitivity was \u20ac0.3 million (previous year: \u20ac0.4 million).\n\nSince fiscal 2021, we also measure the price risk of equities in RWE's portfolio using sensitivity analysis. As of the balance-sheet date, this analysis yielded the following results (before taxes): In the event of a 10/uni2009% rise in the relevant equity prices, equity would increase by \u20ac490 million (previous year: \u20ac358 million) and income by \u20ac9 million (previous year: \u20ac0 million). In the event of a 10/uni2009% fall in the relevant equity prices, equity would decrease by \u20ac490 million (previous year: \u20ac358 million) and income by \u20ac9 million (previous year: \u20ac0 million).",

        "page_content": "2\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nThe key internal control parameters for commodity positions at RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading are the VaR for the trading business and the VaR for the pooled gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) business. Here, the maximum VaR is \u20ac50 million and \u20ac25 million, respectively. As of 31 December 2021, the VaR was \u20ac30.6 million in the trading business (previous year: \u20ac25.0 million) and \u20ac14.9 million for the pooled gas and LNG business (previous year: \u20ac6.7 million).\n\nAdditionally, stress tests are carried out on a monthly basis in  relation to the trading and pooled LNG and gas business of RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading to model the impact of commodity price  changes on the earnings conditions and take risk-mitigating measures if necessary. In these stress tests, market price curves are modified, and the commodity position is revalued on this basis. Historical scenarios of  extreme prices and realistic, fictitious price scenarios are modelled. In the event that the stress tests exceed internal  thresholds, these scenarios are then analysed in detail in relation to their impact and probability, and - if necessary - risk-mitigating measures are considered.\n\nCommodity risks of the Group's power generation companies  belonging to the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear and Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas segments are managed by the Commodity Management Commitee (CMC) and hedged by the Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading segment on the basis of available market liquidity in accordance with Group guidelines. In accordance with the approach for long-term investments for example, it is not possible to manage commodity risks from long-term positions or positions which cannot be hedged due to their size and the prevailing market liquidity using the VaR concept. As a result, these positions are not included in the VaR figures. Above and beyond open production positions which have not  yet been transferred, the Group companies belonging to the Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear and Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009/ Gas segments are not allowed to maintain significant risk positions, according to a Group guideline. Furthermore, commodity price risks can exist in relation to the renewable generation positions and in the gas storage business. The commodity price risks associated with the renewable generation positions are managed by the Renewables Commodity Management Committee (RES CMC). The subsidiaries owning the gas storage facilities also manage their positions independently, in compliance with unbundling regulations.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\nOne of our most important instruments to limit market risk is the conclusion of hedging transactions. The instruments most commonly used are forwards and options with foreign currency, interest rate swaps, interest rate currency swaps, equity capital derivatives, and forwards, options, futures and swaps with commodities.\n\nMaturities of derivatives related to interest rates, currencies, equity capital, indices and commodities for the purpose of hedging are based on the maturities of the underlying transactions and are thus primarily short term and medium term in nature. Hedges of the foreign currency risks of foreign investments have maturities of up to ten years.\n\nAll derivative financial instruments within the scope of IFRS 9 are recognised as assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. When interpreting their positive and negative fair values, it should be taken into account that, with the exception of trading in commodities, these financial instruments are generally matched with underlying transactions that carry offsetting risks.\n\nHedge accounting pursuant to IFRS 9 is used primarily for mitigating currency risks from net investments in foreign functional currencies, commodity market price risks, interest risks from non-current liabilities and currency and price risks from sales and purchase transactions.\n\nIn the previous year, fair value hedges were used to limit the market price risk exposure related to CO 2 emission allowances. In the case of fair value hedges, both the derivative as well as the underlying hedged transaction (in relation to the hedged risk) are recorded at fair value with an effect on income.",

Hedging instruments consist of forwards, swaps and options with foreign currency and interest rates, and forwards, futures and swaps with commodities. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments - insofar as they affect the effective portion - are recorded in other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction is realised. The ineffective portion of changes in value is recognised in profit or loss. When hedging commodities, underlying and hedging transactions are based on the same price index. This generally does not result in ineffectiveness. When hedging foreign currency risks, ineffectiveness can result from the difference in timing between the origination of the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Ineffectiveness can likewise stem from hedges containing material foreign currency basis spreads. Upon realisation of the underlying trans action, the hedge's contribution to income from accumulated other comprehensive income is recognised on the income statement or is offset against the initial value recognition of an asset or a liability.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\nRWE held the following instruments to hedge future cash flows relating to foreign currency risks:\n\n| Cash flow hedges                           | Maturity                     | Maturity                     | Maturity       |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------|\n| as of 31 Dec 2021                          | 1/uni2009-/uni20096   months | 7/uni2009-/uni200912  months | > 12   months  |\n| Currency forwards - purchases              |                              |                              |                |\n| Nominal volume (\u20ac million)                 | 850                          | 377                          | 686            |\n| Avg.

Hedged items and hedging instruments are constantly adjusted based on changes in market prices, market liquidity and the sales business with consumers. Commodity prices are hedged if this leads to a positive margin. Proprietary commodities trading is strictly separated from this when managing risks.\n\nHedges of net investment in a foreign operation are used to hedge the foreign currency risks of net investment in foreign entities whose functional currency is not the euro. We use interest rate currency swaps and other currency derivatives as hedging instruments. If there are changes in the fair value of interest rate currency swaps, the amount of the effective portion is recorded under foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe forward and spot elements of the hedging instruments used in net investment hedges are treated separately and only the value of the spot element is designated. In these cases, the fair value change of the forward element (hedging costs) is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the fair value change relates to the hedged net investment. Moreover, the fair value of the forward element as of the time of designation is amortised over the duration of the hedging instrument using the straight-line method and recognised in profit or loss.\n\n| Cash flow hedges                  | Maturity                     | Maturity                     | Maturity      |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|\n| as of 31 Dec 2020                 | 1/uni2009-/uni20096   months | 7/uni2009-/uni200912  months | > 12   months |\n| Interest swaps                    |                              |                              |               |\n| Nominal volume (\u00a3 million)        |                              |                              | 1,215         |\n| Secured average interest rate (%) |                              |                              | 1.55          |",

        "page_content": "## To our investors\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## Responsibility statement\n\nAs part of the reform of the current system for determining reference interest rates (the so-called IBOR reform), the existing reference rates and methods for determining such were replaced with alternative interest rates and methods. In the EU, the EONIA was discontinued on 3 January 2022, and in the United Kingdom the LIBOR was phased out after 31 December 2021.\n\nWith regard to the RWE Group, the IBOR reform impacts the accounting treatment of certain financial liabilities and hedging relationships which serve to reduce the interest rate risks associated with non-current liabilities. These hedging relationships are based on the 1-month GBP LIBOR and the 6-month GBP LIBOR. As of 31 December 2021, the transition to alternative interest rates was not yet complete. The designated hedging instruments had a nominal volume of \u20ac1,318 million and a carrying amount of \u20ac47 million as of the reporting date. The total carrying amount of the hedged financial liabilities was \u20ac1,413 million as of the reporting date.\n\nRWE is managing the transition to the new benchmark rates by way of an interdisciplinary working group headed by the Finance & Credit Risk Department. Its focus is on supplementing, amending and reassessing the relevant contracts and carrying out the technically necessary system adjustments. With regard to the financial liabilities and derivatives designated in hedging relationships, RWE has initiated negotiations with the contractual partners to transition the interest rates previously based on the GBP LIBOR to the GBP SONIA plus a spread which offsets the difference between the two reference rates. The amended credit contracts were concluded on 10 January 2022, with an effective transition to SONIA as of 31 January 2022. As part of the transition from GBP LIBOR to SONIA plus a spread, the hedging instruments which hedged the previous interest rate risk from the GBP LIBOR were also adjusted. The hedging relationships were adjusted on 10 January 2022, with effective transition as of 31 January 2022.\n\nStarting from 1 January 2020, RWE applied the amendments in IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, which were published in September 2019. The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\nhedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform. The reliefs primarily mean that the uncertainties arising from the IBOR reform do not result in discontinuation of the hedging relationships. Hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recognised in the profit or loss.\n\nAt the time of the aforementioned contractual adjustments in January 2022, RWE also applied the amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2, which were published in August 2020. These amendments allow for other temporary reliefs for the accounting treatment of hedging relationships which are affected by the IBOR reform.\n\nCredit risks. In the fields of finance and commodities, RWE primarily has credit relationships with banks that have good creditworthiness and other trading partners with predominantly good creditworthiness. Furthermore, RWE has credit relationships primarily with banks and other business partners with good creditworthiness within the scope of large-scale projects such as the construction of wind farms. RWE reviews counterparty default risks before contracts are concluded. RWE mitigates such risks by establishing limits which are adjusted during the business relationships if the creditworthiness of the business partners changes. Counterparty risks are monitored constantly so that countermeasures can be initiated early on. Furthermore, RWE is exposed to credit risks due to the possibility of customers failing to meet their payment obligations. We identify these risks by conducting regular analyses of the creditworthiness of our customers and initiate countermeasures if necessary.\n\nDue to the coronavirus crisis, the economic situation of many companies deteriorated. While the current economic recovery is leading to an improvement in their situation, RWE's business partners, competitors and customers may continue to be impacted by the consequences of the crisis, as well as by the very strong price developments seen on the energy markets since the fourth quarter of 2021. RWE is thus carefully monitoring critical branches of the economy and exercising greater caution when conducting new transactions or extending existing ones. If necessary, previously approved limits are being lowered.",

Furthermore, RWE takes out credit insurance policies to protect against defaults. Bank guarantees received as collateral are from financial institutions with the required good ratings. Collateral for credit insurance is pledged by insurers with an investment-grade rating.\n\nThe maximum balance-sheet default risk is derived from the carrying amounts of the financial assets stated on the balance sheet. The default risks for derivatives correspond to their positive fair values. Risks can also stem from financial guarantees and loan commitments which we have to fulfil vis-\u00e0-vis external creditors in the event of a default of a certain debtor. As of 31 December 2021, these obligations amounted to \u20ac1,231 million (previous year: \u20ac417 million). As of 31 December 2021, default risks were balanced against credit collateral, financial guarantees, bank guarantees and other collaterals amounting to \u20ac10.1 billion (previous year: \u20ac3.6 billion). Of this, \u20ac0.6 billion relates to trade receivables (previous year: \u20ac0.8 billion), \u20ac1.5 billion to derivatives used for hedging purposes (previous year: \u20ac0.6 billion), and \u20ac8.0 billion to other derivatives (previous year: \u20ac2.2 billion). There were no material defaults in fiscal 2021 or the previous year.\n\nIn the RWE Group, the risk provision for financial assets is determined on the basis of expected credit losses. These are determined on the basis of the probability of default, loss given default and the exposure at default. We determine the probability of default and loss given default using historical data and forward-looking information. The exposure at default date for financial assets is the gross carrying amount on the balance-sheet date. The expected credit loss for financial assets determined on this basis corresponds to the difference between the contractually agreed payments and the payments expected by RWE, discounted by the original effective interest rate. The assignment to one of the levels described below influences the level of the expected losses and the effective interest income recognised.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n## Notes\n\n- \u00b7  Stage 1 - Expected 12-month credit losses: At initial recognition, financial assets are generally assigned to this stage - with the exception of those that have been purchased or originated credit impaired, which are thus considered separately. The level of impairment results from the cash flows expected for the entire term of the financial instrument, multiplied by the probability of a default within 12 months from the reporting date. The effective interest rate used for measurement is determined on the basis of the carrying amount before impairment (gross).\n- \u00b7  Stage 2 - Lifetime expected credit losses (gross):  If the credit risk has risen significantly between initial recognition and the reporting date, the financial instrument is assigned to this stage. Unlike Stage 1, default events expected beyond the 12-month period from the reporting date are also considered in calculating the impairment. The effective interest rate used for measurement is still determined on the basis of the carrying amount before impairment (gross).\n- \u00b7  Stage 3 - Lifetime expected credit losses (net): If in addition to the criteria for Stage 2 there is an objective indication of an impairment, the financial asset is assigned to Stage 3. The impairment is calculated analogously to Stage 2. In this case, however, the effective interest rate used for measurement is applied to the carrying amount after impairment (net).\n\nIn the RWE Group, risk provisions are formed for financial instruments in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7  debt instruments measured at amortised cost,\n- \u00b7  debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.",

In addition, a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 1 of the impairment model if the absolute credit risk is low on the balance-sheet date. The credit risk is classified as low if the debtor's internal or external rating is investment-grade. For trade accounts receivable, the risk provision corresponds to the lifetime expected credit losses (Stage 2).\n\nTo determine whether a financial instrument is assigned to Stage 2 of the impairment model, it must be determined whether the credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition. To make this assessment, we consider quantitative and qualitative information supported by our experience and assumptions regarding future developments. In so doing, special importance is accorded to the sector in which the RWE Group's debtors are active. Our experience is based on studies and data from financial analysts and government authorities, amongst others.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the following developments:\n\n- \u00b7  significant deterioration of the internal or external rating of the financial instrument,\n- \u00b7  unfavourable changes in risk indicators, e./uni2009g. credit spreads or debtor-related credit default swaps,\n- \u00b7  negative development of the debtor's regulatory, technological or economic environment,\n- \u00b7  danger of an unfavourable development of business resulting in a significant reduction in  operating income.\n\nIndependent thereof, a significant rise in credit risk and thus an assignment of the financial instrument to Stage 2 are assumed if the contractually agreed payments are more than 30 days overdue and there is no information that contradicts the assumption of a payment default.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n## Notes\n\nWe draw conclusions about the potential default of a counterparty from information from internal credit risk management. If internal or external information indicates that the counterparty cannot fulfil its obligations, the associated receivables are classified as unrecoverable and assigned to Stage 3 of the impairment model. Examples of such information are:\n\n- \u00b7  The debtor of the receivable has apparent financial difficulties.\n- \u00b7  The debtor has already committed a breach of contract by missing or delaying payments.\n- \u00b7  Concessions already had to be made to the debtor.\n- \u00b7  An insolvency or another restructuring procedure is impending.\n- \u00b7  The market for the financial asset is no longer active.\n- \u00b7  A sale is only possible at a high discount, which reflects the debtor's reduced creditworthiness.\n\nA payment default and an associated assignment of the financial asset to Stage 3 is also assumed if the contractually agreed payments are more than 90 days overdue and there is no information disproving the assumption of a payment default. Based on our experience, we generally assume that this assumption does not apply to trade accounts receivable.\n\nA financial asset is depreciated if there are indications that the counterparty is in serious financial difficulty and the situation is unlikely to improve. We may also take legal recourse and other measures in order to enforce the contractually agreed payments in the event of an impairment.",

In this regard, there is a risk that liquidity reserves will prove to be insufficient to meet financial obligations in a timely manner. In 2022, liabilities owed to banks of \u20ac3.6 billion (previous year: \u20ac0.1 billion) are due. Above and beyond this, commercial paper in the amount of \u20ac2.7 billion matures in 2022 (previous year: \u20ac0 billion).\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, holdings of cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities amounted to \u20ac13,865 million (previous year: \u20ac8,993 million).\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\nThe volume of RWE AG's credit line amounts to \u20ac5 billion. Its two tranches expire in April 2022 (\u20ac2 billion) and April 2026 (\u20ac3 billion). The commercial paper programme allows for issuance up to a maximum amount of \u20ac5 billion (previous year: \u20ac5 billion). As of the balancesheet date, \u20ac2.7 billion of this programme was used (previous year: \u20ac0 billion). Above and beyond this, RWE AG can finance itself using a \u20ac10 billion debt issuance programme; as of the balance- sheet date, outstanding bonds from this programme amounted to \u20ac1.85 billion (previous year: \u20ac0 billion) at RWE AG. Accordingly, the RWE Group's medium- term liquidity risk can be classified as low.\n\nFinancial liabilities falling under the scope of IFRS 7 are expected to result in the following (undiscounted) payments in the coming years:\n\n| Redemption and interest payments on       |                               | Redemption payments   | Redemption payments   | Redemption payments   | Interest payments   | Interest payments   | Interest payments   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| financial liabilities \u20ac million           | Carrying amounts  31 Dec 2021 | 2022                  | 2023 to 2026          | From 2027             | 2022                | 2023 to 2026        | From 2027           |\n| Bonds payable /uni20091                   | 2,411                         |                       | 562                   | 1,849                 | 42                  | 157                 | 70                  |\n| Commercial paper                          | 2,710                         | 2,710                 |                       |                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| Bank debt                                 | 5,583                         | 3,568                 | 281                   | 1,733                 | 34                  | 127                 | 98                  |\n| Lease liabilities                         | 1,409                         | 86                    | 273                   | 1,061                 | 20                  | 102                 | 252                 |\n| Other financial liabilities               | 1,442                         | 374                   | 441                   | 649                   | 80                  | 197                 | 498                 |\n| Derivative financial liabilities          | 76,992                        | 76,250                | 222                   | 532                   | 45                  | 68                  | 128                 |\n| Collateral for trading activities         | 4,239                         | 4,239                 |                       |                       |                     |                     |                     |\n| Miscellaneous other financial liabilities | 4,975                         | 4,892                 | 86                    | 2                     |                     |                     |                     |",

Additionally, Group companies have provided loan commitments to third-party companies amounting to \u20ac40 million (previous year: \u20ac53 million), which are callable in 2022.\n\nDetailed information on the risks of the RWE Group and on the objectives and procedures of the risk management is presented on pages 70 et seqq. in the review of operations.\n\n## (28)  Contingent assets, contingent liabilities and financial commitments\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the amount of contractual commitments totalled \u20ac5,668 million (previous year: \u20ac2,071 million). This mainly consisted of investment in property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe have made long-term contractual purchase commitments for supplies of fuels, including natural gas in particular. Payment obligations stemming from the major long-term\n\npurchase contracts amounted to \u20ac22.3 billion as of 31 December 2021 (previous year: \u20ac23.6 billion), of which \u20ac0.3 billion is due within one year (previous year: \u20ac0.3 billion).\n\nGas purchases by the RWE Group are partially based on long-term take-or-pay contracts. The conditions in these contracts, which have terms up to 2036 in some cases, are renegotiated by the contractual partners at certain intervals, which may result in changes in the reported payment obligations. Calculation of the payment obligations resulting from the purchase contracts is based on parameters from the internal planning.\n\nFurthermore, RWE has long-term financial commitments for purchases of electricity. As of 31 December 2021, the minimum payment obligations stemming from the major purchase contracts totalled \u20ac7.1 billion (previous year: \u20ac7.1 billion), of which \u20ac0.4 billion is due within one year (previous year: \u20ac0.3 billion). Above and beyond this, there are also long-term purchase and service contracts for uranium, conversion, enrichment and fabrication.",

From 1 January 2022 onwards, RWE AG has a 36.927/uni2009% contractual share in the liability (37.299/uni2009% until 31 December 2021) plus 5/uni2009% for damage settlement costs.\n\nAs part of the Group restructuring that occurred in fiscal 2016, a large portion of the pension commitments which up to then had been reported at the holding level were transferred to former Group companies (former subsidiaries innogy SE, Essen, and affiliated companies) by cancelling the performance obligation existing on an intra-group basis. The guarantees remaining vis-\u00e0-vis external parties were cancelled. The Group is liable for the accrued claims of the active and former employees of these companies in the amount of \u20ac5,875 million (previous year: \u20ac6,404 million).\n\nRWE AG and its subsidiaries are involved in official, regulatory and antitrust proceedings, litigation and arbitration proceedings related to their operations and are affected by the results of such. In some cases, out-of-court claims are also filed. However, RWE does not expect any material negative repercussions from these proceedings on the RWE Group's economic or financial position.\n\nWith the approval of the Senate, the Dutch Parliament passed an amendment of the Coal Phaseout Act, which limits the carbon dioxide emissions of power plants to 35% of the maximum possible level by the end of 2024. RWE will be entitled to compensation payments for the economic disadvantages it will suffer. As foreseen in the Act, we expect to submit an application for compensation in the upper triple-digit million range in a timely manner.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n## (29)  Segment reporting\n\nRWE is divided into five segments, which are separated from each other based on functional criteria.\n\nIn the Offshore Wind segment, we report on our business in offshore wind, which is overseen by RWE Renewables. The main production sites are located in the United Kingdom and Germany. In addition to electricity generation, activities in this field also include the development and realisation of projects to expand capacity.\n\nOnshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar encompasses our activities with onshore wind, solar power and battery storage. Here again, in addition to electricity generation, the focus is on expanding capacities. RWE Renewables has operating responsibility. Along with the USA, the main production sites are located in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands, as well as in Australia in the field of solar power.\n\nActivities with run-of-river, pumped storage, biomass, and gas-fired power plants are bundled in the Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas segment. It also contains the Dutch hard coal power stations Amer 9 and Eemshaven, which are increasingly co-firing biomass, and the company RWE Technology International, which specialises in project management and engineering services. This segment is the responsibility of RWE Generation, which has also been responsible for formulating and implementing our hydrogen strategy since 2021. The 37.9/uni2009% stake in the Austrian energy utility KELAG is also reported in the Hydro/uni2009//uni2009Biomass/uni2009//uni2009Gas segment.\n\nThe Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading segment contains energy and commodities trading, the marketing and hedging of the RWE Group's electricity position and the gas midstream business. This segment is the responsibility of RWE Supply/uni2009&/uni2009Trading, which also supplies certain major industrial and commercial customers with electricity and natural gas. Additionally, gas storage facilities in Germany and the Czech Republic also belong to this segment.\n\nThe Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear segment covers German electricity production using lignite and nuclear power, as well as lignite mining operations in the Rhineland. It also includes the investment in\n\n5\n\n## Further information",

The external revenue of the segments Offshore Wind and Onshore Wind/uni2009//uni2009Solar contains state subsidies and refunds paid to state bodies for the sale of green electricity, including subsidies from contracts for differences, amounting to -\u20ac39 million (previous year: \u20ac0 million) and \u20ac2 million (previous year: \u20ac51 million), respectively, which do not meet the definition of IFRS 15. These contracts for differences are used as a state subsidy mechanism and essentially result in a fixed price for the electricity that is sold, by offset-\n\nitive and negative deviations (in so-called two-way contracts for difference) and negative deviations (in so-called one-way contracts for difference) from a defined reference price that is agreed with state contractual partners or the subsidy mechanism counterparty. We report revenue between the segments as RWE intra-group revenue. Internal supply of goods and services is settled at arm's length conditions.",

They are reclassified to the non-operating result. In addition to proceeds from the disposal of shareholdings or non-current assets not necessary for operations, this item mainly covers effects from the valuation of certain derivatives. These involve valuation effects which are only temporary and mainly arise because financial instruments to hedge price risks are reported at their fair value on the respective reporting date, while the hedged underlying transactions may only be recorded with an effect on income upon the realisation of such. A loss of \u20ac168 million is reported in the item 'other' (previous year: -/uni2009\u20ac2,003 million). The 2020 result included impairment charges on power plants and opencast lignite mines amounting to \u20ac1.8 billion. Impairments were recognised in the lignite business during the reporting period as well, in the amount of \u20ac780 million. The compensation of \u20ac880 million paid to us in November 2021 by the German Federal government for the phaseout of nuclear energy in Germany had a positive effect.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n| Non-operating result                               | 2021         | 2020 1         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| \u20ac million                                          |              |                |\n| Disposal result                                    | 21           | 13             |\n| Impact of the valuation of derivatives on earnings | -/uni2009503 | 1,886          |\n| Other                                              | -/uni2009168 | -/uni20092,003 |\n| Non-operating result                               | -/uni2009650 | -/uni2009104   |\n\n## (30)  Notes to the cash flow statement\n\nThe cash flow statement classifies cash flows according to operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement correspond to the amount stated on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and fixed-interest marketable securities with a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.\n\nAmong other things, cash flows from operating activities include:\n\n- \u00b7  cash flows from interest and dividends of \u20ac263 million (previous year: \u20ac281 million) and cash flows used for interest expenses of \u20ac284 million (previous year: \u20ac299 million),\n- \u00b7  \u20ac163 million (previous year: /uni2009-\u20ac72 million) in taxes on income paid (less refunds),\n- \u00b7  income from investments, corrected for items without an effect on cash flows, in particular from accounting using the equity method, which amounted to \u20ac185 million (previous year: \u20ac323 million).\n\nCash flows from the acquisition and sale of consolidated subsidiaries and other business units are included in cash flows from investing activities, while effects stemming from exchange rate developments and other changes in value are shown separately. During the fiscal year, sales prices in the amount of \u20ac619 million (previous year: \u20ac872 million) were recognised for disposals resulting in a change of control.

The pre-payment of a purchase price in the previous year, which was already reported in the cash flows from investing activities last year, is not included in this figure, as there had been no change of control at that point in time.

In relation to this, cash and cash equivalents (disregarding assets held for sale) were acquired in the amount of \u20ac52 million (previous year: \u20ac0 million) and were sold in the amount of \u20ac39 million (previous year: \u20ac5 million).\n\nWith regard to subsidiaries or other business units of which control was gained or lost, the amounts of assets and liabilities (with the exception of cash and cash equivalents) are presented in the following, broken down by main groups:\n\n| Balance-sheet items 2021 \u20ac million   | Additions   | Disposals   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Non-current assets                   | 2,073       | 786         |\n| Intangible assets                    | 951         | 29          |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 1,003       | 119         |\n| Other non-current assets             | 119         | 638         |\n| Current assets                       | 451         | 1,238       |\n| Non-current liabilities              | 189         | 201         |\n| Provisions                           | 116         | 1           |\n| Financial liabilities                | 24          | 175         |\n| Other non-current liabilities        | 49          | 25          |\n| Current liabilities                  | 27          | 654         |\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\n| Balance-sheet items 2020 \u20ac million   | Additions   | Disposals   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Non-current assets                   | 541         | 131         |\n| Intangible assets                    | 395         | 6           |\n| Property, plant and equipment        | 133         | 120         |\n| Other non-current assets             | 13          | 5           |\n| Current assets                       | 10          | 1,357       |\n| Non-current liabilities              | 48          | 20          |\n| Provisions                           |             | 3           |\n| Financial liabilities                |             | 11          |\n| Other non-current liabilities        | 48          | 6           |\n| Current liabilities                  | 89          | 584         |\n\nCash flows from financing activities of continuing operations include \u20ac575 million (previous year: \u20ac492 million) which was distributed to RWE shareholders, and \u20ac155 million (previous year: \u20ac30 million) which was distributed to non-controlling shareholders.

At the end of February 2022, we were successful in an auction of seabed leases for offshore wind sites in the New York Bight. A joint venture between RWE and National Grid Ventures secured an area for US$1.1 billion, on which about 3 GW of generation capacity can be built, which would be capable of producing enough electricity to serve 1.1 million US homes. The auction included six lease sites, with bidders being allowed to secure one each. Every successful bid conferred the right to develop a site and participate in upcoming auctions of the conditions for purchasing the electricity in the",

If the project progresses as planned, our offshore wind farm in the New York Bight will be commissioned during this decade.\n\nWind joint venture with Northland Power launched. In January 2022, RWE and Northland Power initiated a joint venture for the development of wind energy projects in the German North Sea. We expect this cooperation to deliver substantial synergies, resulting in cost savings in the development, construction and operation of the assets. RWE owns 51 % and our Canadian partner owns 49 % of the joint venture, which encompasses three offshore wind projects aiming to develop a total capacity of 1.3 GW. The sites of the future wind farms are located north of the Island of Juist. Before forging the joint venture, we had co-operated with Northland Power on two of the three projects. One project is focussed on a 433 MW wind farm on a site officially called N-3.8, which we secured via a step-in right following an invitation to tender in 2021 (see page 41). The other initiative was dedicated to the construction and operation of a 420 MW wind farm, which we hope to build on the N-3.5 site. We also have a step-in right for this area, but have not exercised it yet. RWE initially only held a 15 % share of both ventures and had originally developed the third joint venture project alone. It is centred around a 480 MW wind farm at the N-3.6 site, for which we also hold a step-in right which has not been made use of to date. The auctions for the sites N-3.5 and N-3.6 should be held in 2023. In the event that other companies are successful, we can exercise our step-in rights.\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\nNotes\n\nHuge uncertainty after Russian attack on Ukraine. Russian troops marched into Ukraine at the end of February. This constitutes an invasion under international law, prompting outrage and consternation around the globe. Many countries including the USA, EU member states and the United Kingdom imposed economic sanctions on Russia. Uncertainty concerning commodity deliveries from Russia to Europe has caused a significant increase in gas and electricity trading quotations. In some European countries, including Germany, governments are working on measures to reduce dependency on Russian oil and gas imports. When the consolidated financial statements were prepared in early March 2022, it was impossible to predict the development of the Ukraine conflict or its consequences. Although RWE does not have business activities in Russia or Ukraine, further escalation of the conflict and discontinuation of supply relationships with Russian companies could have notable effects on our assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss. It is possible, for example, that Russian commodity suppliers will no longer be able to meet their obligations and that we will have to purchase commodities at high prices on the market. It cannot be ruled out that contractual partners may become insolvent due to sanctions. Additionally, changes in security prices due to a stock market crisis resulting from the Ukraine conflict may have a significant impact on RWE's financial assets and those of our pension funds. More detailed information can be found in the chapter entitled 'Development of risks and opportunities', which starts on page 70.\n\nRWE once again successful in British capacity market auctions. The British capacity market held another auction on 22 February, relating to the delivery period from 1 October 2025 to 30 September 2026. We secured a payment for all participating RWE power stations, including two small new-builds. Altogether, these assets have a secured capacity of 6,647 MW. At \u00a330.59 / kW per annum (plus inflation adjustment), the capacity payment established in the bidding procedure was the highest such figure since the capacity market auctions started in 2014. A total of 42.4 GW in generation capacity qualified for a capacity payment at the auction. During the delivery period, they will receive remuneration for being online and contributing to electricity supply.",

Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report' section of our auditor's report.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most signi/ficance in our audit were as follows:\n\n- Recoverability of goodwill\n- Recoverability in the 'Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear' segment\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n- Matter and issue\n- Audit approach and /findings\n- Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recoverability of goodwill\n\n- In the consolidated /financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft, goodwill amounting to \u20ac2.7 billion (1.9/uni2009% of consolidated total assets; previous year: \u20ac2.7 billion, or 4.4/uni2009% of consolidated total assets) is reported under the balance sheet item 'Intangible assets'.\n\n4\n\n## Consolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or when there are indications of impairment, to determine any possible need for write-downs. The carrying amounts of the relevant cash-generating units, including goodwill, are compared with the corresponding recoverable amounts in the context of the impairment tests. The recoverable amount is generally calculated on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal. The impairment tests are performed at the level of the cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units to which the respective goodwill is allocated. The measurements to calculate the fair value less costs of disposal carried out for the purposes of the impairment tests are based on the present values of the future cash /flows generally derived from the planning projections for the next three years (medium-term plan) prepared by the executive directors and acknowledged by the supervisory board. Expectations relating to future market developments and country-speci/fic assumptions about the performance of macroeconomic indicators are also taken into account. Present values are calculated using discounted cash /flow models. The discount rate applied is the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant cash- generating unit. The impairment test determined that no write-downs were necessary. The outcome of these valuations is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors of the future cash in/flows of the cash-generating units, and on the respective discount rates, rates of growth and other assumptions employed. The measurement is therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Against this background and due to the underlying complexity of the measurement, this matter was of particular signi/ficance in the context of our audit.\n\n- As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for performing impairment tests and assessed the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we assessed whether the future cash in/flows underlying the measurements together with the weighted cost of capital used represent an appropriate basis for the impairment tests overall. We evaluated the appropriateness of the future cash in/flows used in the calculations, among other things, by comparing this data with the Group's",

In this context, we also assessed whether the costs of Group functions were properly included in the respective cash-generating unit. With the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have material e/ffects on the fair values less costs of disposal calculated in this way, we also focused our assessment on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. Furthermore, we evaluated the sensitivity analyses performed by the Company in order to assess any impairment risk (carrying amount higher than recoverable amount) in the event of a reasonably possible change in a material assumption underlying the measurement. Overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n\n- The Company's disclosures relating to goodwill are contained in the notes to the /financial statements in section 'Notes to the Balance Sheet' in note '(10) Intangible assets'.\n\n## Recoverability in the 'Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear' segment\n\n- In the consolidated /financial statements of RWE Aktiengesellschaft open cast mines (hereinafter referred to as 'property, plant and equipment') in the 'Coal/uni2009//uni2009Nuclear' segment amounting to \u20ac0.9 billion were impaired due to the signi/ficant deterioration on market conditions stemming from regulatory climate protection measures. The recoverability of property, plant and equipment was tested on the basis of their fair values less costs of disposal that exceed their values in use. The fair values of the respective property, plant and equipment are determined by the Company as the present value of the future cash /flows using discounted cash /flow models. The budget projections for the coming three years (medium-term planning) prepared by the executive directors and acknowledged by the supervisory board are used as a basis and extrapolated on the basis of long-term assumptions with regard to electricity,\n\n4\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\n5\n\n## Further information\n\nIndependent auditor's report\n\ncoal, natural gas and CO 2 certi/ficate prices as well as the planned service lives. The outcome of these valuations is dependent to a large extent on the estimates made by the executive directors of the future cash /flows, and on the discount rates, rates of growth and other assumptions employed. The measurement is therefore subject to considerable uncertainties, so that this matter was of particular signi/ficance in the context of our audit.\n\n- As part of our audit, we, among other things, evaluated the method used for testing the recoverability of property, plant and equipment and assessed the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital. In addition, we assessed whether the future cash in/flows underlying the measurements together with the weighted cost of capital used represent an appropriate basis for testing recoverability overall. We assessed the appropriateness of the future cash in/flows used in the measurement by, inter alia, comparing this data with the medium-term planning and reconciling it against general and sector-speci/fic market expectations with regard to electricity, coal, natural gas and CO 2 certi/ficate prices and the planned service lives. Furthermore, on the basis of the medium-term planning, we assessed the recoverability of the property, plant and equipment based on the evidence provided to us. With the knowledge that even relatively small changes in the discount rate applied can have material e/ffects on the fair values calculated in this way, we also focused our assessment on the parameters used to determine the discount rate applied, and evaluated the measurement model. Overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are in line with our expectations and are also within the ranges considered by us to be reasonable.\n- The Company's disclosures relating to impairments of property, plant and equipment are contained in the notes to the /financial statements in section 'Notes to the Income Statement' in note '(5) Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses'.",
