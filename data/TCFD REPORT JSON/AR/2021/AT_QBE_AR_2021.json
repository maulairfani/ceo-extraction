In this environment we continue to provide support and innovative solutions in response, focusing on their wellbeing and continued recovery.\n\nWhile the global pandemic and associated economic and societal impacts have been top of mind for everyone, we recognise the ever-increasing threat of climate change. In 2021 a high level of natural catastrophes ranging from severe flooding and hurricanes to unprecedented rainfall and record-breaking temperatures impacted our results during the year.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, QBE has seen a strong return to profitability and growth, reflecting the strength of our business and the ongoing hard work by our teams across the world. We remain well placed to support and grow with our customers as the economies in which we operate recover.\n\nWe are pleased with our statutory profit of $750 million for the 2021 financial year\n\nand the significant level of growth in each of our divisions. This growth and operating performance were achieved while also maintaining our strong capital position. Delivery against strategic priorities and an unrelenting focus on the fundamentals of the business were critical to this improved performance. As a result of this improved outcome, the Board has declared a final dividend of 19 Australian cents per share, up from nil for the 2020 final dividend.\n\n## Leadership\n\nIn March 2021, we were pleased to announce the appointment of Andrew Horton as our new Group Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 September. Andrew has over 30 years' experience in insurance and banking and has a deep understanding of the insurance landscape. During the interview process, the Board was particularly impressed with his engaging, inclusive and collaborative leadership style. It is evident that Andrew is a leader who believes in the power\n\nof culture as a key driver of business success and he has already demonstrated his keenness to build on the important work of our Board-sponsored Culture Accelerator program to enhance and evolve QBE's culture.\n\nAndrew succeeded Richard Pryce who provided important continuity and stable leadership as Interim Group Chief Executive Officer for the better part of 2021. On behalf of our shareholders, the Board and all of the people of QBE, I extend my thanks to Richard for his leadership during his time at QBE and wish him well in his retirement.\n\nWe also made key appointments to our Group Executive Committee in 2021, complementing the existing team and skillset. We welcomed Fiona Larnach as Group Chief Risk Officer in March and Sue Houghton as our new Chief Executive Officer, Australia Pacific in August. Sam Harrison was promoted to the role of Group Chief Underwriting Officer in April and Amanda Hughes was promoted to the role of Group Executive, People and",

        "page_content": "Culture in December, reflecting our focus on succession planning and investment in the development of our talent pipeline.\n\nOur Group Executive Committee now comprises 45.5% women and reflects our commitment to diversity. We continued to make progress on our target of having 40% women in leadership by 2025, with an increase over last year from 34.8% to 35.9%.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board is committed to a respectful and inclusive environment for all our people and culture has remained a key focus throughout the year. We made significant progress with our Culture Accelerator, which has been sponsored by John Green, Deputy Chair, and Tan Le, non-executive director, reflecting its importance. We believe culture is foundational to our future success.\n\nAs a result of this work, we have a clear view of our target-state culture and a blueprint for change which will guide our focus over coming years. Our people are at the heart of our culture and have shaped the pathway forward. We have undertaken a comprehensive review of our culture by engaging with our people through a global survey, interviews with over 150 senior leaders across the business and workshops with over 1,000 employees. A global culture advisory group of 20 leaders and a culture connectors group of 120 employees were established and will continue to shape how we better foster and embed a QBE culture which embraces an inclusive and respectful workplace.\n\nTo help our people understand expected behaviour, we refreshed our QBE DNA which interlinks seven cultural attributes that are fundamental to who we are and how we operate to achieve success. Moreover, we introduced a shared language of behaviours, to help everyone live the QBE DNA each day.\n\nCentral to our cultural efforts has been an ongoing focus on inclusion and diversity. We conducted a global maturity assessment and refreshed our Inclusion of Diversity Policy.\n\nA key aspect of culture is how we invest in our people and foster talent, particularly with a focus on succession planning and building future-ready leaders across our organisation. During the year, QBE introduced the executive team health framework which is designed to support the development of our current and future Group Executive leaders, with specific and measurable outcomes based on relevant context and priorities. We will continue to use these tools as we look to cascade our talent practices to build a consistent people focus and accountability throughout the organisation.\n\n## Operating sustainably\n\nQBE remains committed to integrating sustainability across the business. Our sustainability framework helps drive performance, manage risks and identify opportunities across the areas\n\nof sustainability that are most important to our business, customers, communities and other stakeholders. There are six focus areas outlined in our framework: sustainable insurance, impact and responsible investment, operational excellence, people and culture, customer and community, and governance.\n\nIn line with our framework, we publish an annual Sustainability Scorecard that outlines our key initiatives, commitments and targets. During 2021, we made strong progress against our scorecard and continued to strengthen our approach to sustainability. Further information can be found in our 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\nIn June 2021, we published QBE's Human Rights Policy outlining our commitment to respecting human rights in our role as an employer, insurer, investor and business partner. We have also outlined how we respect human rights in our interactions with customers and in our communities. We will continue to integrate human rights considerations across the business according to international principles.\n\nOur annual Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement will be released in due course, outlining the steps we have taken to identify and address modern slavery risks across our operations and supply chain. In 2022, we will continue to enhance our modern slavery program of work.\n\nOur new Environmental and Social Risk Framework became effective from 1 January 2022 and our focus has been on integrating this into our business over the last year. The framework further supports the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into our core business and helps improve transparency for our customers.\n\nThrough our positions in the framework, we have committed to reduce our exposure to higher transition risks in the energy sector including no new coal and oil sands projects, and only supporting oil sands and Arctic drilling where the company is on a pathway consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement objectives. Further detail on how we assess the transition pathway is on page 36. We also continue to maintain zero direct investments in thermal coal.\n\nQBE has a diverse and international portfolio of customers in the energy sector, and we are committed to working with them to support a shift to more sustainable business models and reducing the emissions intensity across the economy.\n\nAn exclusionary approach to all fossil fuel-related activity on a categorical basis does not represent an orderly path to a net-zero economy. Gas continues to be an important transition fuel and oil has a role in many transport sectors, in addition to its inclusion in many industrial processes, until viable alternatives are available. We need energy that is reliable, safely produced and affordable as well as clean. We continue to support a smooth transition pathway\n\nand new business models that are being implemented at pace, particularly where this is towards renewable energy.\n\nClimate change is a global challenge requiring the collaborative efforts of a range of stakeholders to minimise economic disruption and deliver an orderly transition to a net-zero emissions economy. We engage in climate-related partnerships for impact, working with government, industry, customers and community groups.\n\nIn 2020, we were proud to be the first Australian-based insurer to join the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance,  committing to transition our investment portfolio to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We also extended our commitment to supporting the transition to a net-zero economy by joining the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance in January 2022 and by setting a new target to achieve net-zero emissions for our global operations by 2030. We remain focused on our commitment to reduce our overall energy use and source 100% renewable electricity for our operations by 2025.\n\nIn January this year, we launched a sustainable energies unit in our International business to support customers as they transition to lower carbon energy. The unit will align QBE underwriting to the growing range of companies and energy systems that form part of a rapidly changing energy mix throughout the world. Projects include hydrogen, ammonia, hydro, solar, fixed and floating wind-power and carbon capture and sequestration.\n\nWe remain proud of our impact investment initiative, Premiums4Good, which now has $1.4 billion invested in 83 securities across 10 impact areas, and our ambition is to grow impact investments to $2 billion by 2025.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWhile some uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook for 2022, we start the year expecting supportive trading conditions across the major markets in which we operate. Noting the strong momentum across the Group, we remain confident of further growth and margin improvement in 2022.\n\nWe also start the year with a renewed QBE Vision and Purpose and longer-term strategic priorities, which are outlined in detail in the Group Chief Executive Officer's report on page 6. It has never been more important to have a Vision and Purpose that appropriately reflect the ambitions of the organisation and the world in which we live. Our refined Vision and Purpose provide a strong sense of direction for the future.\n\n2021 was another momentous but ultimately successful year for our organisation and I thank all our employees, customers, partners, shareholders and my fellow directors for their continued support of QBE.\n\n## Mike Wilkins AO\n\nIndependent Chair\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Positive momentum across the business\n\nThe global economy continued to recover in 2021 as a gradual reopening in key regions saw activity levels progressively normalise, underpinned by supportive fiscal and monetary policy settings. The economic outlook remains encouraging into 2022, although we remain conscious of the risks associated with inflationary pressures, ongoing disruption to global supply chains and the withdrawal of emergency stimulus measures in many key economies.\n\nThe Omicron variant serves to highlight that the health and economic risks associated with COVID-19 will be ongoing in 2022. Against this backdrop, we continue to support our people, customers and communities and recognise their ongoing resilience through 2021. Maintaining momentum in global vaccination programs will remain a key mitigating factor throughout the year.\n\nInsurance trading conditions were favourable throughout 2021 and QBE remained focused on driving further improvement in profitability while also achieving measured growth across select portfolios. Our top line momentum was particularly noteworthy, supported by strong rate increases across all divisions, improved premium retention and targeted new business growth.\n\nFollowing another year of elevated natural catastrophe claims costs, building inflationary signals and continued low interest rates, the premium pricing environment is expected to remain supportive in 2022. With such a degree of uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, the industry should remain pragmatic about both building financial resilience and improving returns.\n\n## Business performance\n\nWe experienced positive momentum across the business in 2021, culminating in a statutory combined operating ratio of 93.7%, compared with 104.2% in the prior year. Group-wide premium rate increases of 9.7% were again broadbased and continue to compound on prior\n\nyear increases including 9.8% achieved in 2020. Constant currency premium growth was 22%, the strongest organic growth achieved in over a decade, underpinned by ex-rate growth of 15% as targeted growth initiatives gathered momentum. US Crop delivered outstanding growth, assisted by materially higher commodity prices and further growth in policy count.\n\nHeightened natural catastrophe activity continued in 2021, with annual insurance industry insured losses likely to settle as one of the highest on record. Not surprisingly given this backdrop, catastrophe costs of $924 million materially exceeded our planned allowance for the year. This disappointing outcome was partly offset by ongoing expense discipline coupled with positive operating leverage",

        "page_content": "due to strong growth, which contributed to further improvement in our expense ratio to 13.6% from 15.0% in 2020.\n\nOur investment result declined in 2021, albeit materially impacted by the mark-to-market associated with the gradual improvement in risk-free rates over the year, partly offset by a recovery in growth asset returns and improved running yield. Over the course of 2022 and 2023, we expect to gradually add risk to our currently conservative investment asset allocation which, together with the higher running yield at year end, should support an improved investment return in the coming year.\n\nNorth America's performance improved in 2021 benefitting from organic growth and a continued positive rate environment; however, heightened catastrophe experience and further adverse prior accident year claims development resulted in a combined operating ratio of 105.2%. While the result fell short of our expectations, we are focused on a number of initiatives aimed at reducing volatility and balancing the risk profile of the overall business. North America delivered double digit premium growth across all three business segments, helping to drive improved operating leverage, with growth initiatives executed around a focus on building scale and relevance in core portfolios including financial lines and retail. We are confident that performance will continue to improve as the team executes a multi-year strategy to reshape the business into a platform of relevant and at-scale businesses that deliver a consistent, sustainable and appropriate risk-adjusted return on capital.\n\nInternational achieved strong premium growth in 2021 and, while much of this was driven by continued rate momentum across most markets, promising volume growth was noted across the majority of portfolios. The business responded promptly to the UK Supreme Court judgement on COVID-19 business interruption, swiftly paying valid claims and conducting a review of our policy wording in parallel. Our strategic focus has been on both leveraging market conditions to deliver robust in-year performance and building a strong platform for future organic growth across key geographies and sectors. The well diversified nature of our business served us well in 2021, and we will continue to optimise the portfolio to both improve returns and reduce volatility.\n\nAustralia Pacific delivered a strong performance in 2021, achieving premium growth of 17% alongside a materially improved underwriting result. The business maintained its focus on supporting customers, partners and people through the evolving and challenging COVID-19 backdrop while continuing to progress digital capability, develop go-to-market propositions and maintain 'Brilliant Basics' operating\n\ndisciplines. This helped to deliver a material improvement in customer retention and new business volumes which, together with the recovering economy and sustained strong rating environment, supported encouraging business momentum.\n\n- Further detailed information on our financial performance is outlined in the Group Chief Financial Officer's report on page 10.\n\n## Our people, customers and communities\n\nThroughout 2021, our people successfully navigated a constantly changing landscape, demonstrating both resilience and adaptability. I am proud of their hard work and steadfast focus on supporting our customers, partners and each other.\n\nWe have continued to evolve our ways of working in response to the systemic shifts brought about by the pandemic. Our people have embraced hybrid working which provides greater flexibility to work from home or the office, depending on the nature of work required. Our ongoing focus on culture and a newly employed listening strategy have enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of what drives employee engagement.\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed our approach to 'inclusion of diversity' recognising that in order to foster and realise the benefits of our differences, it is essential to create an environment where everyone is, and feels, included. We value the collective diversity of our people with different perspectives, backgrounds and ways of working contributing to our ability to innovate, challenge and support each other, and serve our diverse customer base.\n\nWe have worked hard to adapt to the evolving needs of our customers and continually improve our customer support. This year, we further developed digital tools to assess customer claims and expedite our response. In Australia, we have responded to the needs of our more vulnerable customers and now offer domestic violence support, as well as providing interpreter services for customers in over 160 languages and dialects. Supporting those most vulnerable in our community is important to QBE.\n\nIn Europe, we launched a new ESG initiative for SMEs that includes a template sustainability policy and a framework to identify, monitor and manage a range of ESG issues that may impact their business. In North America, we broadened the reach of our Customer@QBE program to further embed a customer mindset through improved customer support training.\n\nImportantly, we have supported customers through a large number of natural perils across the world, including Cyclone Seroja in Western Australia, the Eastern Australian floods, Texas Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in the United States and Storm Bernd in Europe.\n\nWe are proud of the support we provide to the communities in which we operate and, in 2021, our QBE Foundation celebrated its 10th birthday. To mark this anniversary, the QBE Foundation launched a new strategic framework and guiding principles focused on addressing climate resilience and inclusion for communities. Through this increased focus, we believe we can contribute to better prepared communities and improved financial stability, resulting in better outcomes for those in need. The strategy draws on our global sustainability framework, priority United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the annual materiality assessment to achieve greater impact and directly target the areas where QBE can make the greatest contribution.\n\n## Performance against 2021 strategic priorities\n\nMeaningful progress was achieved against each of our 2021 strategic priorities of performance, modernisation, customer focus and culture. We saw significant progress on a number of activities underpinning the performance agenda with the reinvigoration of cell reviews, delivery against key sustainability and climate commitments and targeted growth. Our modernisation journey continues with ongoing efforts to upgrade critical foundational capabilities and to further embed our digital capabilities across the organisation. Embedding automation across underwriting, distribution and claims to support the evolving needs of our customers and partners remains an ongoing focus. While there are still key programs of work to deliver, we are now well progressed with our modernisation journey.\n\nWork on Customer@QBE continued throughout the year with a focus on developing the framework on 'how we show up' to all our customers on a consistent basis across the globe. This builds on the foundational elements of the program that were launched earlier in the year and includes customer mindset (how we think about our customers), insights (the knowledge we have about our customers combined with our insurance expertise) and delivery (what and how we deliver to our customers).\n\nOur talent & culture pillar was a key area of focus throughout the year, building on our QBE DNA and leveraging our work on culture through the Board-sponsored Culture Accelerator program. We have defined the type of culture we want to\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

This important conversation spanned much of the year and involved the entire organisation, creating a refreshed DNA that reflects desired behaviours and a shared language to encourage people to speak up. The work also identified the need for a refreshed recognition program grounded in the DNA.\n\nCultural focus should be ongoing and, now that we have created our first enterprise culture plan, we will embed the Culture Accelerator into our strategic priorities, recognising that culture is one of the fundamental strategic pillars that supports our ongoing success.\n\n## Setting a new strategic direction\n\nI was honoured to join QBE on 1 September 2021 and immediately recognised that I had joined an organisation with great potential. My overarching goal is to establish QBE as a consistently high-performing enterprise that is both culturally and operationally united, with a clear strategic direction.\n\nThe Group Executive and I have spent considerable time defining our strategic priorities for the medium to long term. In determining QBE's future strategic priorities and direction, we felt it was important to go right back to the core of why we exist. We have spent time considering our vision and purpose statements to ensure they better reflect the world in which we live, how we can help to make a positive contribution and support our people. As a result, we were pleased to launch our new Vision and Purpose in January 2022.\n\nOur vision is to be 'the most consistent and innovative risk partner' and our purpose is 'QBE - enabling a more resilient future'.\n\nOur organisational Vision and Purpose have shaped six new strategic priorities for QBE (as outlined in the page opposite), being portfolio optimisation, sustainable growth, bring the enterprise together, modernise our business, our people and our culture.\n\nPortfolio optimisation is about more actively managing the future direction of our business by making deliberate choices about the mix of products we offer, the business lines and geographies in which we operate and the customers we support. This will lead to a better understanding of the risks we are assuming, including the inherent volatility in the business we write, and therefore, a better balance of risk resulting in more consistent outcomes. We will be developing\n\na globally consistent framework to apply across QBE with specified targets to be set by region, customer type and class.\n\nAs we think more broadly about our portfolio mix, we will also identify opportunities that enable QBE to deliver sustainable growth, increasing our reach and strengthening our market relevance. We will harness the depth and breadth of product knowledge and expertise and innovate new product offerings and risk solutions to address our customers' needs. Our growth ambition will be realised through a balanced portfolio of initiatives that include deepening our existing business with clear strategies aligned to risk appetite; selectively extending our core business into new segments, regions or product lines and experimenting to better understand emerging opportunities; and developing innovative solutions for the long term.\n\nTo achieve our vision and deliver on our purpose, we need to evolve our operating model and organisational structure to bring the enterprise together, to help us more effectively organise, manage and leverage our capabilities across all markets. We also need to simplify what we do and remove complexity in how we do it, by supporting strategy-aligned prioritisation of activities, driving consistent processes, having clearer and more effective governance, and providing more clarity of accountabilities across QBE.\n\nTo ensure we are a future fit and modern insurer, we must complete the modernisation of our foundational systems and processes. We also need to accelerate development of, and investment in, our digital capabilities to make interactions with QBE easier for our customers, partners and people. We will strategically invest in differentiating capabilities (people, processes, technology and data) that drive insight and support innovation.\n\nWe are focused on becoming an employer of choice in our chosen markets and on building and empowering a sustainable and diverse pipeline of leaders. Our strategy also depends on our ability to enhance the link between the performance, culture and way we reward our people, so we will be doing further work on this.\n\nWe will also be investing in more targeted workforce and succession planning to ensure we can harness the talent we already have and help to build the capabilities we need now and in the future.\n\nFinally, we will focus on becoming a more purpose-led organisation. We need to strengthen the alignment, trust and collaboration that takes place\n\nacross the enterprise. Our goal is to ensure that our purpose is visible every day, in every interaction we have.\n\nUnderpinning these priorities is a continuing focus on increasing consistency in how we plan and deliver performance, integrating sustainability into all facets of our business, demonstrating an enterprise mindset and continually evolving the experience we provide our customers and partners.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nQBE generated strong momentum in 2021 during a second year impacted by the pandemic, underpinned by a collective team effort across the globe. Our people continue to demonstrate enormous resilience, responding well to the changes in our ways of working, and delivering for our customers and partners.\n\nI am confident we have a strong international insurance business with enormous potential and my priority is to build on the existing business momentum, bringing together our people with our shared Vision and Purpose to drive our future strategic direction.\n\nI want to extend my thanks to both the Group Executive Committee for their hard work and support and the over 11,000 people who come to work each day in support of our customers and partners.\n\n## Outlook\n\nQBE delivered a strong result in 2021, with notable momentum across many of the key value drivers for the business. Our new strategic priorities will build on these strong foundations in 2022, where we are increasingly confident in our ability to drive sustained improvement across the organisation, and expect this should result in a consistent low to mid-90's combined operating ratio for the business. We currently expect growth in constant currency gross written premium in 2022 to be in the high single digits.\n\nAndrew Horton Group Chief Executive Officer",

Growth in our Crop business was particularly strong, supported by higher commodity prices and targeted organic initiatives.\n\nThe statutory combined operating ratio improved to 93.7% from 104.2% in 2020, reflecting significant COVID-19 claims in the 2020 result and improved current accident year profitability.\n\n## Group Chief Financial Officer's report\n\nQBE achieved a strong rebound in profitability during 2021, reflecting a material improvement in underwriting earnings despite heightened catastrophe experience. Favourable market conditions and a focus on targeted growth supported a 22% increase in our premium base. We enter 2022 with real momentum.\n\nThe benefits of increased operating efficiency more than offset a material increase in catastrophe claims.\n\nCrop reported a combined operating ratio of 92.7% compared with 95.0% in the first half and 98.2% in 2020. Underwriting profit increased to $87 million from $14 million in 2020.\n\nThe Group's statutory expense ratio improved to 13.6% from 15.0% in the prior year, reflecting further cost savings from the operational efficiency program coupled with operating leverage due to strong premium growth.\n\nWe are now well into the next phase of our operating efficiency journey, including the rationalisation and modernisation of our IT estate, which is expected to contribute to an expense ratio of 13% by 2023. In addition to cost efficiencies, digitisation and modernisation are expected to drive sustained improvement in operating capacity and business agility.\n\nAs we approach our 13% expense ratio target, we expect to increasingly reinvest incremental operating efficiencies to capitalise on longer-term growth opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Financial strength and capital management\n\nQBE's capital position strengthened during the year, notwithstanding very significant organic growth.\n\nQBE's indicative APRA PCA multiple increased to 1.81x at 31 December 2021. Excluding GBP327 million of subordinated debt intended to be redeemed, the indicative pro forma APRA PCA multiple was 1.75x, up from 1.72x at the end of 2020, and at the higher end of our 1.6-1.8x target range.\n\nThe improvement in the regulatory capital position primarily reflects strong organic earnings generation during the year.\n\nWe have revised our measure of gearing from debt to equity to debt to total capital to align with the approach underpinning our external debt covenants. Debt to total capital was 26.9% at 31 December 2021. Excluding the subordinated debt intended to be redeemed, pro forma gearing improved to 24.1% from 25.8% at the end of 2020, and is within the Group's 15-30% target range.\n\nThe probability of adequacy (PoA) of net outstanding claims reduced slightly to 91.7% from 92.5% at the end of 2020, but remains towards the top end of our 87.5-92.5% target range.\n\n## Investment performance and strategy\n\nThe total investment return for the year was 0.4% and compared with 0.9% in 2020.\n\nDuring the year the Group held a modestly short asset duration relative to outstanding claims liabilities. With the significant steepening in yield curves, the Group generated a pre-tax profit of $41 million as a result of this tactical curve positioning.\n\nOur investment approach remains conservative, with 94% of our cash and investments in high quality fixed income securities and the remaining 6% in risk assets, primarily unlisted property and infrastructure.\n\nIn 2022, we will gradually move towards our long-term strategic asset allocation benchmark of 15% exposure to risk assets, including equities, high yield and emerging market debt, and private credit.\n\n## Summary income statement and underwriting performance\n\n|                                               | STATUTORY   | STATUTORY   | ADJUSTMENTS   | ADJUSTMENTS     | MANAGEMENT BASIS   | MANAGEMENT BASIS   | MANAGEMENT BASIS   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER                | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   | CTP 2021 US$M | COVID 2021 US$M | COVID 2020 US$M    | 2021 1,2 US$M      | 2020  1 US$M       |\n| Gross written premium                         | 18,457      | 14,643      | -

This revised approach will better support the Group's growth ambitions and provide flexibility to manage the dynamics of the global insurance cycle.\n\nThe final dividend for 2021 is 19 Australian cents per share, compared with the nil 2020 final dividend.\n\nThe final dividend will be 10% franked and is payable on 12 April 2022. The Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Bonus Share Plan will be satisfied by the issue of shares at a nil discount.\n\nThe combined 2021 interim and final dividend of 30 Australian cents per share is up substantially from 4 Australian cents per share in 2020 and equates to a total payout of A$443 million or 41% of adjusted cash profit.\n\nThe payout for the current period balances the need to reward shareholders while retaining capital flexibility to support the near-term growth outlook and the normalisation of risk settings in our investment portfolio.\n\n## Significant items impacting the underwriting result\n\nThe summary income statement on the preceding page shows the statutory result excluding the following items to more clearly present underlying performance.\n\n## CTP reinsurance\n\nDuring 2021, the Group entered into a transaction to reinsure Australian CTP prior accident year liabilities which reduced net earned premium and net claims expense by $365 million and $349 million respectively, while positively impacting commission expense by $19 million.\n\nWhile not materially impacting profit, the transaction impacts year-on-year comparison of net earned premium and underwriting ratios.\n\n## COVID/hyphen.cap19\n\nThe result included a COVID-19 benefit of $139 million compared with a charge of $655 million in 2020, mainly due to a $140 million risk margin release reflecting reduced uncertainty with respect to business interruption, LMI and trade credit claims outcomes.\n\nIn addition, a current accident year charge of $63 million was offset by favourable prior accident year claims development of $64 million.\n\nThe current accident year charge included North America claims (mainly accident & health (A&H), professional liability and workers' compensation) and a modest second half charge for potential Australian business interruption claims.\n\nPrior accident year claims development included adverse development in North America which was more than offset by favourable development in International as well as positive development in business interruption, LMI, CTP and trade credit in Australia Pacific.\n\nWhile QBE separately identified obvious COVID-19 impacts, there could be other less significant impacts, both positive and negative, that were not readily identifiable or quantifiable.\n\nFurther commentary in relation to COVID-19 is included in Note 1.2.3 on page 88 of this Annual Report.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the Group and business commentary following excludes the impact of COVID-19 and the 2021 CTP reinsurance transaction.",

Strong premium growth and higher commodity prices contributed to a materially improved expense ratio.\n\n## International\n\nInternational delivered another strong result reporting a combined operating ratio of 90.6%, down from 91.3% in 2020.\n\nExcluding favourable prior accident year claims development, the current accident year combined ratio increased to 91.8% from 89.6% in the prior year.\n\nMaterially higher catastrophe costs more than offset further improvement in the combined commission and expense ratio. Both the insurance and reinsurance businesses were impacted by elevated catastrophe claims which included Storm\n\nBernd as well as Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida in the US.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio increased slightly with the benefit of further premium rate increases on the attritional claims ratio more than offset by strengthened IBNR assumptions, especially with respect to large individual risk claims.\n\nEuropean insurance and Asia recorded improved underwriting results relative to the prior year while QBE Re was impacted by heightened catastrophe costs and adverse prior accident year claims development.\n\n## Australia Pacific\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a strong combined operating ratio of 91.4%, down from 92.8% in 2020.\n\nExcluding adverse prior accident year claims development, the current accident year combined ratio improved to 88.8% from 93.3% in the prior year.\n\nAlthough elevated relative to the prior year, catastrophe claims costs reduced as a percentage of net earned premium.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio and the combined commission and expense ratio improved further, supported by premium rate increases, cost control and favourable operating leverage.\n\nLMI reported a greatly improved combined operating ratio of 35.4%, down from 62.3% in the prior year. The strong residential property market and buoyant employment conditions contributed to the improved underwriting result.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

As an example, 50 simple infrastructure automations delivered to date are estimated to save in excess of 3,750 person days per annum.\n\nWe are nearing completion of the transition from our Sydney data centre to a co-located facility and, as part of this process, have commenced active migration of existing legacy applications to cloud based infrastructure.\n\nThe Group transitioned to a new contract relationship with our main IT service provider earlier in the year which is already delivering material benefits, including\n\nInternational's commission ratio improved due to profit commissions coupled with additional reinsurance on trade credit.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nQBE's effective statutory tax rate was 17.1% compared with a negative 2.6% in the prior year and reflects the mix of corporate tax rates in the countries where we operate, with profits in the North American tax group offset by previously unrecognised tax losses.\n\nThe prior year tax rate was impacted by the non-deductible impairment of goodwill and corresponding write-off of deferred tax assets.\n\nDuring the year, QBE paid $88 million in corporate income tax globally, net of a $3 million refund in Australia which reduced our dividend franking account, the balance of which stood at A$54 million as at 31 December 2021. The franking account balance will enable the Group to fully frank A$126 million of dividends.\n\nHaving regard to QBE's franked AT1 distribution commitments, the dividend franking percentage is expected to remain around 10% for the foreseeable future.\n\nreduced development and operational service costs as well as increased contract flexibility and protection.\n\nOur digital capability continues to improve with digitisation and automation of claims processes and innovation driving improved customer and partner experience, particularly in Australia, Asia and North America.\n\nDuring the year we consolidated our real estate footprint in Australia and North America in line with new working practices. We also achieved a meaningful reduction in third party consulting costs and simplified divisional organisational structures, particularly in North America.\n\nThese measures are supporting reinvestment into key areas of strategic growth and helping to unlock greater operating leverage in our business as well as improving the expense ratio.\n\nThe expected cost of the restructure is approximately $150 million over three years, including a $72 million charge recognised in the current year that was not reported as part of the Group's underwriting expenses.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

At $36 billion, Hurricane Ida resulted in one of the largest individual losses ever recorded.\n\nCatastrophe experience can be intensified by the effects of climate change. In that context, we continue to analyse hazard and claims trends while reviewing our exposure to properly balance the risk we face against the need to achieve an appropriate return on the capital required to support that risk. As a consequence, we are currently reducing our exposure to North American hurricane risk.\n\n## Weighted average risk-free rates\n\nAs tabled on the preceding page, the currency weighted average risk-free rate used to discount net outstanding claims liabilities increased to 0.87% at 31 December 2021 from 0.30% at 31 December 2020.\n\nRisk-free rates increased materially across all currencies resulting in a $301 million underwriting benefit that decreased the net claims ratio by 2.2% compared with a $381 million charge in the prior year that increased the net claims ratio by 3.2%.\n\nThe $301 million beneficial risk-free rate impact on the underwriting result was largely offset by a $260 million adverse mark-to-market impact on investment income.\n\n## Prior accident year claims development\n\nPrior accident year claims development was $192 1,2 million adverse or 1.4% of net earned premium, compared with $366 2 million or 3.1% adverse in the prior year.\n\nNorth America reported $148 2 million of adverse development reflecting significant strengthening in legacy excess & surplus (E&S) lines and discontinued programs. Across reserves for ongoing business, we experienced a modest overall release with increases in financial lines and property programs more than offset by favourable development in commercial retail, workers' compensation and A&H.\n\nInternational reported $66 1 million of favourable development, primarily due to better than expected development in QBE Re casualty, property, UK motor, European liability and Asia which more than offset further strengthening in financial lines and QBE Re North America.\n\nAustralia Pacific reported $111 million of adverse development, reflecting significant strengthening in commercial liability as well as workers' compensation and New Zealand, partly offset by releases in CTP, LMI and credit & surety.\n\n- 1  Excludes $55 million of adverse prior accident year claims development in International which is more than offset by related premium adjustments also recognised in the period.\n- 2  Excludes $1 million (2020 $20 million) of positive prior accident year claims development pertaining to North America Crop insurance that is matched by additional premium cessions under the MPCI scheme.\n\n## Net catastrophe\n\nclaims\n\n(US$M)\n\n905\n\n6.6% of NEP 2020  688\n\nPrior accident year claims development\n\n(US$M)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

As such, the redemption had minimal impact on regulatory capital at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn September 2021, QBE undertook a GBP400 million capital qualifying Tier 2 subordinated debt issuance to prefund the intended redemption of GBP327 million of subordinated debt.\n\nDebt to total capital was 26.9% at 31 December 2021. Allowing for the subordinated debt which is intended to be redeemed, pro forma debt to total capital improved to 24.1% from 25.8% at 31 December 2020.\n\nQBE has $900 million of perpetual fixed rate resetting capital notes that are AT1 qualifying under APRA's capital adequacy framework. The notes are classified as equity, pay franked after tax distributions and do not impact the weighted average number of shares for earnings per share calculations (since the notes are written off in whole or in part if APRA determines QBE is, or would become, non-viable).\n\nThe after-tax distribution on QBE's AT1 capital was $50 million, while the reclassification of the 2017 notes (in July 2020) contributed to an $11 million reduction in financing and other costs during the year.\n\n## Capitalisation and capital metrics\n\n| AS AT 31 DECEMBER             |      |           | 2021      | 2021         | 2020      |\n|-------------------------------|------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|\n|                               |      | BENCHMARK | STATUTORY | PRO FORMA  1 | STATUTORY |\n| Net assets                    | US$M |           | 8,882     | 8,882        | 8,492     |\n| Less: intangible assets       | US$M |           | (2,449)   | (2,449)      | (2,534)   |\n| Net tangible assets           | US$M |           | 6,433     | 6,433        | 5,958     |\n| Add: borrowings               | US$M |           | 3,268     | 2,826        | 2,955     |\n| Total tangible capitalisation | US$M |           | 9,701     | 9,259        | 8,913     |\n| Debt to total capital         | %    | 15-30     | 26.9      | 24.1         | 25.8      |\n| Debt to equity                | %    |           | 36.8      | 31.8         | 34.8      |\n| Debt to tangible equity       | %    |           | 50.8      | 43.9         | 49.6      |\n| Premium solvency  2           | %    |           | 46.7      | 46.7         | 50.6      |\n| QBE's regulatory capital base | US$M |           | 10,387    | 9,945        | 9,348     |\n| APRA's PCA                    | US$M |           | 5,725     | 5,692        | 5,434     |\n| PCA multiple                  |      | 1.6-1.8x  | 1.81x     | 1.75x        | 1.72x     |\n\n- 1  Pro forma adjusting for GBP327 million pre-funded debt repayment intended to be repaid.\n- 2  The ratio of net tangible assets to net earned premium.\n\n## Prescribed capital amount\n\nQBE's indicative PCA multiple increased to 1.81x at 31 December 2021 from 1.72x at 31 December 2020, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7  the $803 million full year cash profit;\n- \u00b7  the GBP400 million subordinated Tier 2 note issue in September 2021; and\n- \u00b7  an increase in the premium liabilities surplus due to significant premium rate increases.\n\nThese beneficial impacts were largely offset by:\n\n- \u00b7  the March 2021 redemption of $200 million of subordinated notes which reduced Tier 2 capital by $37 million;\n- \u00b7  an increase in the insurance liabilities risk charge, primarily driven by strong premium growth; and\n- \u00b7  a higher asset risk charge reflecting the increase in reinsurance recoveries receivable, premium receivable and deferred reinsurance expense.\n\nAllowing for the intended redemption of GBP327 million of subordinated debt, the Group's indicative pro forma PCA multiple was 1.75x, at the higher end of our 1.6-1.8x target range.",

We have several initiatives underway to further optimise and grow the portfolio in order to build a better balanced, less volatile and higher quality earnings base in the region.\n\nWe continue to focus on risk (including reserve, underwriting, catastrophe, credit and operational) at a more granular level to improve capital allocation by cell and by region, thus facilitating a more accurate assessment of premium rate adequacy and better informing our decisions on where to grow. As return on equity continues to improve, we are increasingly focused on developing the systems and culture to sustain long-term organic growth.\n\nAlternatives Investment properties 37 The further, albeit reduced level of, adverse prior accident year claims development was disappointing, particularly in North America. In a reserving context, claims inflation remains a key area of focus and, where appropriate, we have strengthened both current and prior accident year assumptions to allow for elevated inflation levels going forward. Given the uncertain inflationary backdrop, we have also taken a more cautious approach to reserving for large individual risk claims.\n\nTo support our growth ambitions\n\n## Sustainability\n\nNotwithstanding very significant growth, the Group's regulatory capital position strengthened during the year and remains comfortably above the midpoint of our target range. The recently revised dividend policy will better support the Group's growth ambitions, facilitate the gradual re-risking of the investment book and provide flexibility to manage the dynamics of the global insurance cycle more broadly.\n\nMake a positive contribution to the economies and communities in which we operate\n\nDuring 2022, we intend to gradually optimise investment returns by modestly increasing exposure to risk assets, including reintroducing enhanced fixed income assets. Our target asset allocation is designed to be resilient, enabling stable cross-cycle exposures.\n\nFixed income Sustainability is essential to our new purpose and our ability to make a positive and impactful contribution to the environments, economies and communities in which we operate. Progress against our sustainability commitments will enhance our ability to attract and retain customers, talent and capital. Our 2022 Sustainability Scorecard includes clear sustainability goals aligned to the QBE Sustainability Framework and we remain focused on integrating sustainability into our strategy and business planning to meet our climate and broader sustainability commitments.\n\nPolicyholders' funds Growth assets Shareholders' funds With premium rate increases in excess of claims inflation, coupled with ongoing expense discipline and operating leverage, we remain confident of achieving a stronger, more consistent and sustainable level of financial performance over the medium term.\n\nPolicyholders' funds\n\nShareholders' funds\n\nInder Singh Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

While rate increases continue to exceed claims inflation, during 2021 we observed heightened inflationary pressure, most notably in property.\n\nStrong growth, particularly in Crop, financial lines and middle market commercial, reflected higher premium rates, increased new business volumes and slightly improved retention. Materially higher commodity prices underpinned very substantial premium growth in Crop.\n\nIn addition to an improvement in the ex-cat claims ratio, cost savings and operating leverage resulted in a materially lower expense ratio. This was partly offset by elevated catastrophe claims due to Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida.\n\n## Operating and financial performance\n\n## Underwriting performance\n\nNorth America reported a combined operating ratio of 102.9%, down from 112.7% in 2020.\n\nThe result was impacted by a heightened level of catastrophe claims which increased to $305 million or 7.7% of net earned premium compared with 7.1% in 2020.\n\nThe underwriting result benefitted from a 2.5% improvement in the ex-cat claims ratio and a 4.0% reduction in the total acquisition cost ratio, due to rate increases and a combination of cost savings and improved operating leverage.\n\nPrior accident year claims development added 3.7% to the claims ratio, primarily in legacy E&S lines and discontinued programs, albeit down from 9.0% in 2020. We also strengthened our underlying claims inflation assumptions.\n\nThe combined operating ratio for Crop was 92.7% compared with 98.2% reported in 2020.\n\n## Underwriting result\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER     |      | 2021   | EX/hyphen.cap C OVID 2021   | EX/hyphen.cap C OVID 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------|------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium              | US$M | 6,289  | 6,289                       | 4,775                       | 4,361  | 4,450  |\n| Gross earned premium               | US$M | 5,838  | 5,838                       | 4,551                       | 4,375  | 4,348  |\n| Net earned premium                 | US$M | 3,965  | 3,965                       | 3,351                       | 3,692  | 3,557  |\n| Net incurred claims                | US$M | 3,136  | 3,046                       | 2,917                       | 2,929  | 2,397  |\n| Net commission                     | US$M | 512    | 512                         | 486                         | 536    | 535    |\n| Expenses                           | US$M | 460    | 460                         | 469                         | 488    | 528    |\n| Underwriting result                | US$M | (143)  | (53)                        | (521)                       | (261)  | 97     |\n| Net claims ratio                   | %    | 80.7   | 78.4                        | 84.2                        | 77.9   | 68.2   |\n| Net commission ratio               | %    | 12.9   | 12.9                        | 14.5                        | 14.5   | 15.1   |\n| Expense ratio                      | %    | 11.6   | 11.6                        | 14.0                        | 13.2   | 14.8   |\n| Combined operating ratio           | %    | 105.2  | 102.9                       | 112.7                       | 105.6  | 98.1   |\n| Statutory combined operating ratio | %    | 103.6  | 101.3                       | 115.5                       | 107.0  | 97.3   |\n| Insurance (loss) margin            | %    | (2.8)  | (0.6)                       | (14.6)                      | (3.7)  | N/A    |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

This reflected especially strong growth in Crop and 20% growth across broader P&C lines as a result of continued strong premium rate increases, new business growth and slightly improved retention levels.\n\nCrop gross written premium increased 51% primarily due to higher commodity prices, notably for Corn (+18%) and Soybeans (+29%), coupled with organic growth of around 21%. The Crop business continues to grow market share through its especially strong technology-based service offering, deeply ingrained agent loyalty and investment in new talent.\n\nSpecialty & Commercial premium grew 28% compared with 2020. Premium rate increases remained strong in all lines while investment in market-leading talent\n\n## Claims expense\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio improved to 66.7% from 69.3% in 2020 or to 57.1% from 60.2% excluding Crop insurance.\n\nThis reflected rate increases in excess of claims inflation across most classes, coupled with reduced severity in aviation following unusual experience in 2020. Notwithstanding the aforementioned improvement, we observed increased severity in certain property segments and higher social inflation in casualty lines during the second half of the year.\n\nCatastrophe claims increased to 7.7% of net earned premium from 7.1% in 2020, primarily due to Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida.\n\nAdverse prior accident year claims development was $148 million or 3.7% of net earned premium compared with 9.0% in 2020, reflecting significant strengthening in legacy E&S lines and\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe combined commission and expense ratio improved to 24.5% from 28.5% in 2020, partly reflecting the benefit of business mix and operating leverage associated with strong growth in Crop which operates on commission and expense ratios well below the North America average.\n\nas part of the build-out of financial lines translated into strong organic growth. Increased new business in middle market commercial lines, coupled with rate increases and improved retention in A&H, further contributed to premium growth.\n\nAlternative Markets' gross written premium increased 14% due to strong premium rates in commercial property as well as new business growth in casualty programs.\n\nNet earned premium increased 18% to $3,965 million. Growth in net earned premium lagged top line growth largely due to strong growth in heavily reinsured portfolios such as Crop (including growth in dairy that is fully reinsured) while material quota share reinsurance was purchased to prudently support the expansion of our financial lines business.\n\ndiscontinued programs. Elsewhere, increases in financial lines and property programs were more than offset by favourable development in commercial retail, workers' compensation and A&H.\n\nThe result included a risk margin charge of 0.3% of net earned premium compared with a release of 0.7% in the prior year.\n\nClaims management efficiencies and improved operating leverage in the Crop business resulted in a reduction in claims settlement costs to 4.1% of net earned premium from 4.5% in 2020.\n\nThe statutory claims ratio included around 1.3% of COVID-19 related claims, primarily in A&H, professional liability and workers' compensation as well as a 1.0% impact from COVID-19 related supply chain disruption which resulted in higher average claims costs, most notably in property classes.\n\nExcluding Crop, North America's combined commission and expense ratio improved by approximately 3%, due to underwriting expense savings coupled with improved operating leverage as a result of strong premium growth in targeted segments.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10.7%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 0.5% from 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by class of business Gross earned premium by class of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                         | 2021 %   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Agriculture                  | 42.9     |\n| /circle6   Commercial &                 |          |\n| domestic property                       | 22.7     |\n| /circle6   Professional indemnity       | 12.6     |\n| /circle6   Accident & health            | 7.7      |\n| /circle6   Workers' compensation        | 5.7      |\n| /circle6   Public/product liability     | 4.0      |\n| /circle6   Marine, energy & aviation    | 2.4      |\n| /circle6   Motor & motor casualty       | 1.0      |\n| /circle6   Financial & credit and other | 1.0      |\n\n## Combined commission and expense ratio\n\n## 24.5%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.0% from 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nNOTE: 'O\n\n4\n\n6\n\nRetail\n\nSpecialty & Commercial\n\nAlternative Markets\n\nCrop",

Double digit rate increases prevailed across regional UK and London Market business while pricing momentum in European insurance increased as the year progressed. Although there are signs of a deceleration in certain areas of the portfolio, this is typically limited to classes that have benefitted from very material cumulative increases over recent years.\n\nWe are seeing increasing opportunities to grow in European insurance and targeted areas within casualty and specialty reinsurance. Maintaining underwriting discipline and utilising portfolio optimisation techniques remain key and we have curtailed plans for growth in lines where further rate increases are warranted with short-tail reinsurance lines being a pertinent example.\n\n## Operating and financial performance\n\n## Underwriting performance\n\nInternational reported a combined operating ratio of 90.6% compared with 91.3% in 2020. The improved underwriting performance reflects favourable prior accident year claims development (relative to adverse development in 2020) which more than offset heightened catastrophe experience.\n\nThe improvement in underwriting profitability was broad based with International Markets, the UK, Continental Europe and Asia all recording an improved underwriting margin, while QBE Re was impacted by heightened catastrophe experience and adverse prior accident year claims development.\n\nExcluding Asia, the combined operating ratio of our insurance business improved to 86.5% from 88.6% in 2020, while QBE Re's combined ratio increased to 98.7% from 96.4% in the prior year due to heightened catastrophe activity in both North America and Europe.\n\nProfitability in our Asian business improved, delivering a combined operating ratio of 96.7% compared with 100.8% in 2020.\n\n## Underwriting result\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER     |      | 2021   | EX/hyphen.cap C OVID 2021   | EX/hyphen.cap C OVID 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------|------|--------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium              | US$M | 6,962  | 6,958                       | 5,856                       | 5,200  | 5,137  |\n| Gross earned premium               | US$M | 6,480  | 6,476                       | 5,542                       | 5,010  | 5,153  |\n| Net earned premium                 | US$M | 5,539  | 5,545                       | 4,812                       | 4,339  | 4,463  |\n| Net incurred claims                | US$M | 3,118  | 3,134                       | 3,106                       | 2,918  | 2,811  |\n| Net commission                     | US$M | 978    | 980                         | 877                         | 752    | 840    |\n| Expenses                           | US$M | 724    | 726                         | 655                         | 652    | 657    |\n| Underwriting result                | US$M | 719    | 704                         | 174                         | 17     | 155    |\n| Net claims ratio                   | %    | 59.6   | 59.8                        | 59.4                        | 64.5   | 63.2   |\n| Net commission ratio               | %    | 17.6   | 17.7                        | 18.3                        | 17.3   | 18.8   |\n| Expense ratio                      | %    | 13.1   | 13.1                        | 13.6                        | 15.0   | 14.7   |\n| Combined operating ratio           | %    | 90.3   | 90.6                        | 91.3                        | 96.8   | 96.7   |\n| Statutory combined operating ratio | %    | 87.0   | 87.3                        | 96.4                        | 99.6   | 96.6   |\n| Insurance profit margin            | %    | 13.2   | 12.9                        | 5.5                         | 7.9    | N/A    |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

        "page_content": "## Premium income\n\nGross written premium increased 15% to $6,958 million, reflecting the strong premium rate environment coupled with improved retention and strong new business growth which accelerated over the second half of the year.\n\nPremium retention improved to 86% from 83% in 2020, while new business increased 10% relative to the prior year.\n\nInternational achieved an average renewal premium rate increase of 10.2% compared with 12.8% in the prior year, including increases of 13.4% in International Markets and 10.5% in the UK. Although renewal rates are showing some signs of moderating, particularly in the London Market, rate increases remain well above inflation and portfolios that require further correction, such as financial lines and international liability, continue to attract strong rate increases.\n\nContinental Europe is benefitting from rate acceleration, with an average renewal rate increase of 11.4% compared with 7.8% in 2020. Growth was achieved across\n\n## Claims expense\n\nThe net claims ratio increased to 59.8% from 59.4% in 2020.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio increased slightly to 53.1% from 52.8%, with the benefit of premium rate increases in excess of claims inflation more than offset by stronger IBNR assumptions in respect of long-tail classes.\n\nNet catastrophe costs increased to $359 million or 6.5% of net earned premium compared with 4.3% in the prior year, and impacted both the primary and reinsurance businesses.\n\nThe heightened catastrophe experience reflected a number of large events, including Texas Winter Storm Uri in the first half, and Storm Bernd and Hurricane Ida in the second half of the year.\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe net commission ratio reduced to 17.7% from 18.3% in 2020. This was largely due to the combined effect of profit commission revenue from reinsurers in International Markets and additional reinsurance on trade credit associated with government support initiatives.\n\nThe expense ratio improved to 13.1% from 13.6% in the prior year, due to ongoing positive operating leverage alongside disciplined expense management, which saw the increase in constant currency underwriting expense contained to 4% relative to premium growth of 15%.\n\ntargeted areas including property, financial lines and liability portfolios.\n\nPremium pricing remains more subdued across reinsurance markets, with rate increases averaging 7.3%, broadly consistent with 2020. Growth was achieved in casualty and specialty lines across our London, New York, Bermuda and Dubai platforms, though we continue to maintain discipline in property classes where returns remain less compelling despite recent rate increases.\n\nAsia has been challenged by the economic effects of COVID-19. Government restrictions impacted our travel insurance business and we have significantly reduced our trade credit exposure.\n\nStrong growth in gross written premium is translating to momentum in net earned premium which increased 11% during the year. Growth in net earned premium is despite absorbing increased reinsurance costs including government reinsurance of trade credit insurance.\n\nThe result included positive prior accident year claims development of $66 million or 1.2% of net earned premium compared with 1.7% of adverse development in the prior year. This was primarily due to better than expected development in QBE Re casualty, property, UK motor, European liability and Asia, which more than offset further strengthening in financial lines and QBE Re North America.\n\nThe result included a risk margin charge of 0.4% of net earned premium compared with 0.6% in the prior year.\n\nClaims settlement costs reduced to 1.8% of net earned premium from 2.0% in 2020.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by segment\n\n|                                  | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n|                                  | %      |\n| /circle6   International Markets | 32.9   |\n| /circle6   UK                    | 24.1   |\n| /circle6   QBE Re                | 22.5   |\n| /circle6   Continental Europe    | 14.1   |\n| /circle6   Asia                  | 6.4    |\n\n## Gross written premium by class of business Gross earned premium by class of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                         | 2021 %   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Commercial &                 |          |\n| domestic property                       | 27.9     |\n| /circle6   Public/product liability     | 22.6     |\n| /circle6   Marine, energy & aviation    | 14.6     |\n| /circle6   Professional indemnity       | 12.6     |\n| /circle6   Motor & motor casualty       | 12.2     |\n| /circle6   Workers' compensation        | 4.5      |\n| /circle6   Accident & health            | 3.3      |\n| /circle6   Financial & credit and other | 2.3      |\n\n## Combined commission and expense ratio\n\n## 30.8%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.1% from 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Gross written premium increased 17% underpinned by an average renewal premium rate increase of 8.3%, new business growth and improved retention.\n\nSue Houghton \u00b7 Chief Executive Officer \u00b7 Australia Pacific\n\n## 2021 overview\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a material profit uplift in 2021, underpinned by strong premium growth and improved underwriting profitability.\n\nBrilliant Basics initiatives supported targeted premium growth, with the continued modernisation of partner propositions enabling the establishment of new distribution partnerships and the strengthening of existing relationships. This, in turn, drove improved customer retention and a strong uplift in new business volumes, particularly in commercial lines.\n\nClaims initiatives, including digitisation and automation, continued to enhance customer and distribution partner experience, also contributing to improved retention and new business growth.\n\nDespite COVID-19, the economy remained resilient and the housing market buoyant. Together with the addition of a major bank broker relationship, this supported strong premium growth in LMI.\n\nNatural peril activity remained elevated, although not quite to the extent experienced in 2020. Nevertheless, catastrophe costs were once again above planned allowances with La Nina conditions contributing to a heightened frequency of flood and storm activity. Cyclone Seroja, the Victorian Earthquake and bushfires in Western Australia were also notable events in 2021.\n\n## Operating and financial performance\n\n## Underwriting performance\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a combined operating ratio of 91.4% compared with 92.8% in 2020. A further reduction in the ex-cat claims ratio coupled with efficiency gains more than offset adverse prior accident year claims development.\n\nThe current accident year combined operating ratio improved to 88.8% from 93.3% in the prior year.\n\nLMI's combined operating ratio improved to 35.4% from 62.3% in 2020. Better than expected economic conditions, including low unemployment and strong house price appreciation, contributed to lower arrears and claims severity. The statutory result also included $26 million of favourable COVID-19 related prior accident year development.\n\nWhile the initial COVID-19 related business interruption test case ruling was favourable, the final cost will remain uncertain pending the outcome of the Federal Court appeal, clarity around the application of the ruling and any further avenues of appeal. Regardless of the eventual outcome, QBE remains comfortable with its net provision (inclusive of the related and substantial risk margin).\n\n## Underwriting result\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER     |      | 2021   | EX/hyphen.cap C TP/ COVID  2021   | EX/hyphen.cap COVID 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------|------|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium              | US$M | 5,215  | 5,215                             | 4,079                      | 3,920  | 4,104  |\n| Gross earned premium               | US$M | 4,730  | 4,731                             | 3,985                      | 3,885  | 4,103  |\n| Net earned premium                 | US$M | 3,900  | 4,265                             | 3,626                      | 3,568  | 3,758  |\n| Net incurred claims                | US$M | 2,217  | 2,640                             | 2,316                      | 2,223  | 2,310  |\n| Net commission                     | US$M | 581    | 600                               | 534                        | 526    | 561    |\n| Expenses                           | US$M | 601    | 601                               | 555                        | 519    | 542    |\n| Underwriting result                | US$M | 501    | 424                               | 221                        | 300    | 345    |\n| Net claims ratio                   | %    | 58.3   | 63.2                              | 62.8                       | 60.7   | 61.0   |\n| Net commission ratio               | %    | 14.9   | 14.1                              | 14.7                       | 14.8   | 14.9   |\n| Expense ratio                      | %    | 15.4   | 14.1                              | 15.3                       | 14.5   | 14.4   |\n| Combined operating ratio           | %    | 88.6   | 91.4                              | 92.8                       | 90.0   | 90.3   |\n| Statutory combined operating ratio | %    | 87.2   | 90.1                              | 93.9                       | 91.6   | 90.8   |\n| Insurance profit margin            | %    | 13.4   | 10.4                              | 6.9                        | 13.6   | 13.3   |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

        "page_content": "## Premium income\n\nGross written premium increased 17% to $5,215 million reflecting healthy premium rate increases across the majority of our portfolios coupled with improved retention and strong new business growth.\n\nExcluding the structural moderation in CTP premium, underlying gross written premium growth was even stronger at 20%.\n\nRenewal premium rate increases averaged 8.3%, up from 5.4% in 2020. Premium rate increases were particularly strong in strata, householders, liability, commercial property and engineering.\n\nPremium rate momentum increased during the second half in response to ongoing catastrophe experience and the associated implications for reinsurance costs.\n\nPremium retention improved to 87% from 86% in 2020 while new business increased 32% relative to the prior year.\n\n## Claims expense\n\nThe net claims ratio increased to 63.2% from 62.8% in 2020, due to adverse prior accident year claims development which more than offset an improved ex-cat claims ratio and lower (albeit still elevated) catastrophe costs.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio improved to 54.2% from 56.6% in 2020, reflecting the benefit of premium rate increases in excess of inflation coupled with continued refinements to risk selection and claims management initiatives. These were partly offset by increased non-cat weather claims impacting householders and further premium rate reductions in CTP.\n\nCatastrophe claims remained elevated at $242 million or 5.7% of net earned premium, albeit down from 6.7% in 2020, which included the extreme and widespread bushfires on Australia's east coast.\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe combined commission and expense ratio improved to 28.2% from 30.0% in the prior year.\n\nThe net commission ratio reduced to 14.1% from 14.7% in 2020, reflecting business mix changes and additional commission income associated with increased LMI quota share reinsurance.\n\nPremium growth was broad-based with\n\nstrong growth achieved in workers' compensation, LMI, commercial packages, farm, engineering, New Zealand, householders and private motor. This was moderated slightly by a modest reduction in CTP, personal accident and the Pacific, the latter due to subdued economic conditions.\n\nLMI gross written premium increased by $104 million, helped by expansion of a major bank relationship and increased market lending volumes driven by historically low interest rates and government stimulus. Despite the top line growth, LMI's net earned premium increased by only $21 million due to the long-term earning pattern of the business and an increase in quota share reinsurance to 50% from 30% in 2020.\n\nNet earned premium increased 8%, below top line growth and reflecting increased reinsurance costs, the LMI impact noted above and the delay in premium earning after an acceleration in written premium growth.\n\nAlthough down from the prior year, catastrophe claims exceeded Australia Pacific's increased catastrophe allowance primarily due to an increased frequency of storm and flood claims, consistent with the La Nina weather pattern.\n\nPrior accident year claims development was $111 million adverse or 2.6% of net earned premium compared with a favourable impact of 0.5% in 2020. This reflected significant strengthening in commercial liability as well as workers' compensation and New Zealand, partly offset by releases in CTP, LMI and credit & surety.\n\nOur claims teams continue to adapt to mitigate the impact of inflationary pressures from border restrictions and supply chain disruption. Inflationary pressures in a number of short-tail classes were largely offset by some lock-down related frequency benefits in motor and CTP.\n\nThe expense ratio improved to 14.1% from 15.3% in the prior year, primarily due to positive operating leverage associated with premium growth coupled with disciplined cost containment.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 8.3%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.9% from 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by segment\n\n|                                         |   2021 % |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Commercial                   |     58.9 |\n| /circle6   Personal                     |     24.4 |\n| /circle6   New Zealand & Paci/f.shortic |      8.9 |\n| /circle6   LMI & Financial              |      7.8 |\n\n## Gross written premium by class of business Gross earned premium by class of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            | 2021 %   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Commercial &  domestic property | 39.3     |\n| /circle6   Motor & motor casualty          | 22.7     |\n| /circle6   Public/product liability        | 8.7      |\n| /circle6   Financial & credit              | 8.0      |\n| /circle6   Workers' compensation           | 7.3      |\n| /circle6   Agriculture                     | 7. 1     |\n| /circle6   Marine, energy & aviation       | 3.0      |\n| /circle6   Professional indemnity          | 2.5      |\n| /circle6   Accident & health               | 1.4      |\n\n## Combined commission and expense ratio\n\n## 28.2%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.8% from 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Managing risk -our business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introduction\n\nQBE has proactively managed the economic and insurance exposure impacts of COVID-19 alongside the operational challenges presented by the pandemic. COVID-19 has changed our approach to remote working, increasing the need for QBE to implement policies and practices to support a hybrid workforce. The focus now is on the ongoing monitoring and management of the risks that arise with a hybrid workforce.\n\nBusiness interruption claims and associated legal test cases and class actions have presented a number of issues for QBE (as well as the insurance industry more broadly) which we continue to manage through our Business Interruption Steering Committee.\n\nAs a property insurer, QBE is exposed to weather events such as, in 2021 Hurricane Ida and the Winter Storm Uri in North America. Further developing our understanding of the effects of climate change on our underwriting exposures continues to be a top priority for QBE.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management framework\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework describes QBE's approach to managing risk effectively, which in turn supports our strategy and fundamental principles. The purpose of the ERM framework is to embed the way we manage risk in the day-to-day business operations, which in turn supports QBE's overall strategic objectives. The framework covers:\n\n- \u00b7  strategic objectives and business plan;\n\n## Group Chief Risk Officer's report\n\nWe have continued to enhance the maturity of our risk management capabilities, responding effectively to the challenges presented by COVID/hyphen.cap19 and extreme weather in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFiona Larnach Group Chief Risk O/f.short/f.shorticer\n\n- \u00b7  strategic planning, risk appetite and capital management;\n- \u00b7  risk governance, monitoring and reporting;\n- \u00b7  risk identification, measurement and mitigation;\n- \u00b7  risk management systems; and\n- \u00b7  risk skills and risk culture.\n\nQBE continues to mature and enhance our ERM framework, with a heightened focus on embedding increasing community and regulatory expectations into our governance, risk and compliance system, Insight. This allows more informed riskbased decision making that is data driven and represents a significant improvement in our understanding of risk management within QBE. Two of the key processes we use to manage risk and drive more informed risk-based decision making are the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) and Incident and Issue Management processes. The increasing maturity of these processes is allowing QBE to better understand our risk exposures, thereby improving our control environment and allowing us to better manage risk and compliance and drive continuous improvement in a more consistent manner across the Group. This uplift in the way we manage risk in a centralised global platform will help us build a stronger and more resilient QBE.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nQBE's risk governance model reflects a 'three lines of defence' approach, encompassing authorities, accountabilities and responsibilities for managing risk across the Group. In 2021, QBE has continued to focus on embedding the\n\nfirm foundations delivered from the risk transformation program, with greater ownership of risk management in the first line and greater consistency in the way key risks are assessed and understood across the Group.\n\nGovernance structures serve as an important tool in the management of QBE's risk profile. Board and executive committees discuss QBE's risk profile and risk issues, and act as an escalation point for any identified issues or concerns. The alignment of divisional and group-wide risk reporting has further enhanced the risk reporting capabilities and streamlined risk reporting across the Group.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA robust risk management strategy is underpinned by a strong risk mindset and a culture that supports safety to speak up. In 2021, the Group further refined its risk culture framework, working closely with the broader culture initiatives program and aligning to the risk culture guidance provided by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nThrough our culture initiatives, we defined a QBE target state culture, conducted a deep dive on current state culture and commenced implementation of a blueprint for change to address gaps identified. This collaboration has enabled us to further embed a risk mindset across the Group through more explicit inclusion in our refreshed QBE DNA, leadership attributes and cultural metrics. QBE's risk culture was assessed as part of a risk maturity assessment in 2021, which provides a benchmark against which future enhancements will be assessed.",

        "page_content": "## Our top material risks\n\n## Cyber\n\nQBE has continued to develop its cyber security capabilities and control environment to adapt to the ever-changing and increasing internal and external threat of cyber risk. Increasing sophistication of external attackers, along with significant internal technology change such as through the IT modernisation program, demand an effective and up to date cyber security control environment to prevent significant organisational loss, damage or disruption.\n\nQBE has established and built its cyber security foundational capabilities to protect QBE over the last three years of cyber transformation (2019-2021), creating a coordinated function to proactively defend, monitor and respond to known and emerging threats in all our regions. The focus of the Group's cyber security team is to evolve our capabilities to meet the threat landscape, whilst remaining flexible in developing the next horizon of the strategy, and mature today's capabilities that support and protect QBE's modernised technology and business agenda. The focus of the cyber strategy has been on:\n\n- \u00b7  visibility and response - which have provided the ability to quickly detect and respond to suspicious activity in the QBE environment;\n- \u00b7  data security including data loss prevention controls;\n- \u00b7  global identity and access management platforms which ensure our people only have access to the systems and information they need to do their jobs;\n- \u00b7  network security; and\n- \u00b7  a comprehensive global program to raise cyber security risk awareness.\n\n## COVID/hyphen.cap19\n\nCOVID-19 will have an ongoing impact on the broader community, as well as QBE. Actual and potential impacts span investment return volatility, insurance exposures, operational impacts and impacts on staff and the broader population. We remain well reserved for potential COVID-19 insurance claims and continue to closely monitor claims development as well as industry-wide developments. QBE has proactively supported its staff through the pandemic, with a particular focus on wellbeing and mental health. Our return to office strategy is aligned with local government health advice and is targeted at protecting the safety of our staff and other stakeholders.\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate-related risks are likely to impact QBE over the short, medium and long-term. By offering insurance products such as property, crop, marine, aviation and lenders' mortgage insurance, our business is exposed to increased claims from climate-related physical risks such as sea level rise, bushfires, hurricanes and floods. As a result of the transition to a low carbon economy, the insurance needs of our customers are changing, and we need to adjust to ensure we support our customers over the long term. Globally, regulatory and disclosure expectations in relation to the management of climate risk continue to increase.\n\n- Further detail on our approach to managing climate risk is provided on pages 30-37.\n\n## Insurance accumulations\n\nAs an insurance company, accepting appropriate insurance exposures is part of our business. Unknown or inappropriate concentrations of insurance exposures can result in earnings volatility and capital strain. QBE monitors and manages its insurance accumulations closely. We utilise sophisticated modelling to understand both our current and forecast exposures, with a direct link to the Board's risk appetite in relation to extreme loss events. Regular scenario analysis is also utilised to understand the potential impact of unexpected events. Reinsurance and broader portfolio management strategies are integral to ensuring that our insurance accumulations remain at acceptable levels.\n\n## Inflation\n\nAs the global economy continues to emerge from COVID-19, the profile of inflation risk is shifting and has become a source of heightened focus across the Group. Our inflation working group brings together cross-functional leaders to consider predicted inflationary trends and propose our response across all dimensions of QBE's business. The recent supply chain stresses are expected to accentuate claims cost inflation. We have conducted an actuarial review of the potential impact to claims reserves and have made provision for the anticipated trajectory of inflation where appropriate. In addition, pricing teams have incorporated our best forecast of inflation impacts within product pricing models. We continue to monitor this risk and will make adjustments in anticipation of any further changes in trend.\n\n## Our top emerging risks\n\n## Supply chain disruption\n\nAs COVID-19 has shown, supply chain disruption has the potential for material, long-term impacts on businesses and consumers alike. The pace, direction and duration of disruption can vary significantly based on the underlying cause of the disruption. Given the evolving nature of this risk, it is important that we maintain a current and accurate understanding of all major supply chains to our business.\n\n## Changing customer preferences\n\nQBE strives to maintain an accurate and up-to-date view of our customers' preferences and challenges in order to better serve their commercial interests. New technology and ways of working are accelerating innovation and changing the risks customers face and their expectations in terms of delivery, product experience and timeliness. This requires QBE to continuously understand their expectations and respond in an agile and flexible way. These changes will likely have a more immediate impact on personal lines and SME business as customers continue to digitise. The impact on larger clients, which are often intermediated, may take longer to emerge and will likely be linked to understanding and mitigating new types of risks such as autonomy and the increasing importance of cyber and data.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

We recognise the material risk that climate change poses to our business, and are embedding consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities into our decision making.\n\nFocus on climate change has increased significantly across the globe in 2021. The 26th United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) meeting in Glasgow reinforced the need for urgent and significant action to reduce emissions if the world is to achieve the goal of limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 O C. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and Network for Greening the Financial System scenarios were both updated, and there has been a significant increase in the level of regulatory oversight of this risk.\n\nWe support an orderly transition to a net-zero emissions economy, aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement objectives. We recognise the importance of addressing climate change and incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into our decision making.\n\nWe have committed to be a net-zero emissions organisation across our operations by 2030 and through our investment and underwriting activities by 2050.\n\nWe have taken meaningful actions in progressing our commitment to achieving net-zero. For our operations, we set a new target of a further 25% reduction in energy use by 2025 (from a 2019 baseline).\n\nWe are a member of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA) and this year we set intermediate targets for carbon intensity reduction, engagement with high emitting issuers and external managers, and financing the transition.\n\nAs a global insurer, we recognise that the insurance industry has a key role in supporting the transition to a net-zero economy. This is why we have joined the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) and committed to transition our underwriting portfolio to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nWe will need to balance setting out a road map to net-zero with the need to support our customers through their transition. For this reason, we are proud to collaborate with significant industry peers to collectively work our way through these challenges. As a member of the NZIA and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials insured emissions working group, we will contribute to the development of an industry methodology for assessing the carbon intensity of underwriting portfolios. Over the coming years, we will explore strategies and approaches to align our underwriting portfolio with a net-zero emissions by 2050 pathway including setting and communicating our interim targets.\n\nOur Environmental and Social (E&S) Risk Framework came into effect on 1 January 2022. This outlines our updated positions for underwriting and investment across a range of sectors, including energy. Implementing this framework has been a key focus in the last 12 months.",

In order to deliver on our commitment to transition our investment portfolios to net-zero emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures, we established a cross-functional working group composed of key QBE personnel. Members came from areas including fixed income, growth assets, investments data, financial reporting, compliance, ESG risk and sustainability. This diverse representation enabled us to leverage the broad range of skills across our organisation in order to establish our first set of intermediate targets to 2025.\n\nWithin this working group, we established three sub-working groups for our three intermediate target areas (carbon intensity reduction, engagement and financing the transition), each dedicated to setting targets that were suitable for QBE whilst recognising the imperative to decarbonise the real economy, not just our portfolio.\n\nThroughout this process, we utilised the guidance, tools and support of the AOA as well as collaborating with the other members, one on one and in working groups, to leverage the deep insights they gained in developing and setting their own intermediate targets.\n\nIn line with the recommendations made within the AOA Target Setting Protocol, the working groups initially worked to baseline key data including the carbon footprint of our equity and investment grade corporate credit portfolios, identify our top 20 highest emitters and understand our current exposure to assets that finance the transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon intensity reduction\n\nQBE will target a 25% reduction in the carbon intensity of our developed market equity portfolio by 2025, relative to a 2019 baseline. Over the coming years, as methodologies develop through the AOA Target Setting Protocol, we will expand the asset classes where reduction targets are set and continue to align our investment portfolio with the net-zero 2050 objective. We will also continue to communicate our strategy, approach and achievements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe believe that having meaningful dialogue on climate change is a critical component of our responsibility as an asset owner and in ensuring sustainable financial outcomes. Engagement on climate-related risks and opportunities is a key target within our commitment to the UN-convened Net-Zero AOA. We have set a target to engage with the top 20 highest emitters in our portfolio as well as all our external fund managers, deepening our conversations around climate change and setting specific expectations in line with the AOA's Target Setting Protocol.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financing the transition\n\nIn addition to providing risk management solutions, the insurance industry is one of the largest investors in assets globally with trillions of dollars of assets under management. The industry therefore has an opportunity to align investment decisions, and reorient significant capital, to financing the transition. Consistent with this, we currently have over $950 million invested in assets that finance the transition. This is 3% of assets under management (AUM) and, in line with our net-zero 2050 intermediate targets, we aim to grow this to 5% of AUM by 2025. We are also committed to enhancing the supply of assets that finance the transition by working with external fund managers, intermediaries and issuers to develop investable opportunities and participating in relevant industry forums to encourage the development of institutional grade investment products.",

Given its significance in our portfolio, representing approximately half of our AUM, our investment grade corporate credit portfolio has always been a key area of focus for us. We have been tracking the Scope 1 and 2 weighted average carbon intensity of this portfolio monthly since 2019. We have committed to maintaining a low carbon risk rating and are pleased to again have achieved this in 2021. 1\n\n## Weighted average carbon intensity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Carbon risk measures exposure to carbon intensive companies. It is based on MSCI CarbonMetrics and is calculated as the portfolio weighted average of issuer carbon intensity. Carbon intensity is the ratio of annual Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions to annual revenue. Carbon risk is categorised as very low (0 to <15), low (15 to <70), moderate (70 to <250), high (250 to <525), and very high (>=525).\n\n## High emitting sectors exposure\n\nTo confirm the portfolio's low transition risks associated with a disruptive shift to a net-zero economy, we again quantified our exposure by assessing the proportion of our investment grade corporate credit portfolio to high emitting sectors using the Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment tool. Our exposure to these high emitting sectors is small, with 4.3% of our portfolio in automotive, and no exposure to coal mining, power generation, oil and gas production, cement production, steel production, shipping, and aviation, all of which contribute significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding our small exposure to the automotive industry will enable us to continue to target our engagement strategies towards the companies we hold in this sector. Paris Agreement Target 1.5/endash.cap2\u00b0C\n\n## Warming potential\n\nWith increased availability of underlying data tailored to understanding climate risk, working with our data provider we were also able to determine the combined Scope 1 and 2 warming potential of the portfolio. A portfolio's warming potential is calculated as a weighted average of each portfolio company's individual contribution to rising temperatures. While a carbon footprint is intrinsically backwardlooking, a warming potential metric incorporates individual company emission reduction targets and allows for a forward-looking analysis of the portfolio. Our combined Scope 1 and 2 warming potential of 1.9\u00b0C indicates that we are within the Paris Agreement temperature range of 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C. We will continue to push for 1.5\u00b0C alignment through targeted engagement with our highest emitters.\n\nBy understanding where our sector exposures lie and engaging with our top emitters, we will continue our progress towards net-zero by 2050 and 1.5\u00b0C alignment.\n\n## Investment grade corporate credit warming potential\n\nThe temperature gauge illustrates the Scope 1 and 2 combined warming potential for the investment grade corporate credit portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

We adopt targeted engagement to gain insight into integration of climate-related issues, which allows us to understand our exposure to risks and opportunities for improvement.\n\nAn ESG review is undertaken for all existing managers and, as part of this process, we have included targeted due diligence questions focusing on climate change strategy including mitigation and adaptation, policy implementation and practical business actions, with a view to better understanding what emission reduction targets have been set, as well as the key strategic initiatives being undertaken to ensure a just transition.\n\nIn 2021, we strengthened this review process with the introduction of a new scoring methodology, informed by industry best practice frameworks. This scoring methodology allows us to produce a quantitative indicator score of how our external fund managers are implementing responsible investment practices and approaching these key ESG areas including climate risks and opportunities. The outcome of each assessment enables us to further understand the journey of our external fund managers and lays a strong foundation for engagement on action in 2022.\n\nWe have also actively engaged our external fund managers in reporting in line with the TCFD and understanding the climate scenario analysis they are undertaking to identify key physical and transition risks. At a minimum, we will conduct an ESG review annually for all existing managers, with additional reviews if material issues arise. We are also committed to reviewing our own integration of ESG into these processes on an annual basis, to reflect continuing changes in market practice and business priorities.\n\nPositively, while our external fund manager reviews and discussions highlighted that climate change is the largest challenge they are currently facing, over 75% of our external fund managers are committed to net-zero by 2050 and integrating emissions reduction considerations into key investment decisions. Approximately 50% of our external fund managers are also doing targeted work to understand their progress in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and exploring opportunities to further develop in this space.\n\n## Risk management\n\nClimate change is embedded into QBE's risk management framework. As part of our Risk Management Strategy, we categorise risks into eight classes, with ESG risk classified as part of strategic risk.\n\nOur Group ESG Risk Standard, which forms part of our Strategic Risk Policy, outlines the process we use to identify and manage ESG risks across our business. ESG risks are reported to the Group Chief Risk Officer regularly, with our ESG Risk Committee focusing on material ESG risks.\n\nOur E&S Risk Framework helps us identify and mitigate risks to our underwriting and investment portfolios across a range of material ESG risk issues and sectors including energy.\n\nSince the initial release of our E&S Risk Framework, we have focused on the development of practical implementation guidance ahead of it coming into effect.\n\nAs a result of this work, we made some minor amendments to our commitments in relation to biodiversity and protected areas, and controversial weapons to ensure we are able to practically implement and comply with our commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The E&S Risk Framework is available here: www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporategovernance/global-policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk tool\n\nIn Europe QBE has developed a tool to provide a risk management framework for customers to better assess ESG risk. Developed by QBE's Risk Solutions practice, the tool provides a template sustainability policy and ESG framework to help smaller and medium sized enterprises identify, monitor and manage a range of ESG issues that may impact on their business.",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting\n\n## Climate in business planning\n\nThis year, our Group business planning process has explicitly considered the potential impact of climate change. This includes consideration of how climate change is reflected within divisional business plans, the potential impact to the portfolio/product's horizon strategy and anticipated impact on exposures, and any medium-term activities to be considered to adapt to the risks posed by climate change.\n\n## Physical scenario analysis\n\nBoth the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes have increased steadily over time, causing economic and insured losses with the general trend further heightened by climate change. In 2021, we undertook a deeper review of our natural catastrophe exposure to ensure that QBE is not over -exposed to climate risk as the climate continues to change. This resulted in a change in our natural catastrophe business planning philosophy. We strengthened our annual natural catastrophe allowance in the business plan, reflecting the recent period of elevated natural catastrophe activity. We are continuing to learn from the various natural catastrophes, and are continuously refining our models to better price catastrophe risk. This leads to a better understanding of climate change resilience and therefore, where meaningful, credits are built into our pricing for properties with more resilient and energy efficient building features.\n\n## Climate change underwriting strategy\n\nAs part of its roadmap work in response to the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, our European division has undertaken detailed analysis, mapping exposure by line of business to climate sensitive sectors. There has been extensive engagement with the product heads of each line of business on scenario analysis and the identification of risks and responses to inform our underwriting strategy. A divisional climate change underwriting strategy has been developed, led by the division's Chief Underwriting Officer. It is built upon product-based strategies and has been updated to reflect the latest Network for Greening the Financial System transition scenarios as used by the Bank of England as part of its climate biennial exploratory scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey:\n\n- Windstorm\n- Convective storm/Hail\n- Flood\n- Bush/f.shortire/Wild/f.shortire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How do we manage physical risks from climate change?\n\nWe use stochastic catastrophe models to better understand our exposure to climate risk. These models inform capital requirements, policy pricing and risk selection, to monitor our change in climate risk exposure, to define and quantify policy exclusions, and to structure reinsurance protection. They are also used to inform financial and strategic planning. We routinely review the adequacy of our catastrophe models and adjust them to reflect the current climate risk.\n\n## How do we adjust the catastrophe models for future climate change?\n\nFirstly, we need to determine how climate change will impact the intensity and frequency of severe weather events. This requires the interpretation of scientific papers and establishing consensus scientific views on the impact of climate change and the related timeframe for specific weather phenomena and specific regions. The next step is to modify the weather events embedded in the models to reflect the impact of future climate change. Over the past few years we have worked with catastrophe modelling vendors, Risk Management Solutions, Inc. and AIR Worldwide, and with Aon plc to better understand the impact of climate change and to reflect it in our catastrophe models. This exercise essentially provides us with a tool to better quantify the impact future climate change could have on our insurance and reinsurance portfolios.\n\n- Scenario analysis completed\n- Scenario analysis underway\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricing\n\nChange in exposure\n\nExclusions\n\nReinsurance\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to working with them to support a shift to more sustainable business models and providing risk management solutions for innovative technologies which will be key to achieving a net-zero economy by 2050.\n\nWe have committed to reduce our exposure to higher transition risks in the energy sector, including no longer underwriting new coal and oil sands projects and ensuring that we are only supporting oil sands and Arctic drilling where the company is on a pathway consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement objectives.\n\nTo assess the transition pathway for oil sands, we have developed a methodology which considers five key dimensions (governance, metrics, strategy, reporting, and carbon commitments) that will impact a company's emission pathway to 2050. In analysing these dimensions in a standardised way, we expect to gain insight into the level of awareness, acknowledgement and integration of climate change at an operational and a management level. Furthermore, we are seeking to establish how these companies are integrating their climate change strategies into a transition plan. However, this is a complex and unfolding topic, and one in which we need to continue to engage and better understand. It is clear that the evaluation of a pathway towards the Paris Agreement objectives continues to be an evolving space with national, regional and industry-wide issues to consider. In addition, consideration needs to be given to the development and commercialisation of new technologies and other abatement strategies.\n\nWe will rely on each company's public disclosures on this topic to assess these dimensions, but we will also enter into more advanced due diligence discussions with them if this helps to develop and improve our understanding of their approach and baselines. In addition, we will also consider the operational environmental policies in place, particularly those that measure and drive companies towards material reductions in their emissions, as a key consideration in assessing the transition pathway goals in place at the time of underwriting the company. There are restrictions on the maximum policy period QBE will commit to before re-checking their progress.\n\nWe will continue to review our approach towards emissions-intensive industries, including assessing and refining the transition pathway methodology. This will allow us to evolve our approach and reflect changes to national or intergovernmental policies and agreements, technology and the availability of practical alternatives. We will continue to support industries and companies as they themselves work through the transition to a net-zero economy and continue to develop and offer new insurance products and risk management solutions in support of net-zero by 2050.\n\n## Sustainable energies unit\n\nQBE has launched a sustainable energies unit to support customers as they transition to lower carbon energy. The unit will align QBE underwriting capabilities across construction, operational, property & casualty, and D&O lines, focusing on underwriting the growing range of companies and energy systems that form part of a rapidly changing energy mix throughout the world. Projects include hydrogen, ammonia, hydro, solar, fixed and floating wind-power and carbon capture and sequestration.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement\n\nQBE is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. The QBE DNA consists of seven interwoven elements that are fundamental to QBE and how QBE needs to operate to succeed, recognising its customers, people, shareholders and communities. QBE believes that a culture that rewards transparency, integrity and performance will promote its long-term sustainability and the ongoing success of its business.\n\n## Board and management\n\n## Board functions\n\nThe Board charter sets out the role and responsibilities of the Board, including matters expressly reserved for the Board and those delegated to its Committees and management. The role of the Board is to represent and serve the interests of shareholders by providing guidance and oversight of QBE's strategies, policies and performance. This includes demonstrating leadership, setting the strategic direction for QBE, approving QBE values that underpin the desired culture, monitoring the performance of management in the delivery of strategy and instilling the values and desired culture of QBE. The Board's principal objective is to maintain and increase shareholder value while ensuring that the activities of QBE are properly managed.\n\nThe Board reviews strategy on an ongoing basis. To help the Board maintain its understanding of the business and to effectively assess management, directors receive regular presentations from the divisional chief executive officers and other senior managers of the various divisions on relevant topics, including budgets, three-year business plans and operating performance. The Board receives updated forecasts during the year. The non-executive directors also have contact with senior executives in various forums throughout the year.\n\nVisits by non-executive directors to QBE's offices in key locations are encouraged. The Board meets regularly in Australia and, due to QBE's substantial overseas operations, usually spends time in the United Kingdom and the United States each year; however, in 2021, due to COVID-19, Board and Committee meetings, strategy sessions and other meetings were held virtually.\n\nEach formal Board meeting normally considers reports from the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together with other relevant reports. The non-executive directors regularly meet in the absence of management. The Chair and Group Chief Executive Officer in particular, and directors in general, including those on the divisional boards, have substantial contact outside Board and Committee meetings.\n\nDetails of the number of Board meetings held during the 2021 financial year and attendance by directors are set out in the Directors' Report. Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings.\n\n## Senior management functions\n\nManagement's responsibilities are to:\n\n- \u00b7 develop a draft strategy, make recommendations to the Board and implement the Board approved strategy, subject to market conditions;\n- \u00b7 instil and reinforce QBE's values and desired culture;\n- \u00b7 prepare annual budgets and three-year business plans;\n- \u00b7 carry on day-to-day operations within the Board-approved annual budget and three-year business plans, subject to market conditions;\n- \u00b7 design and maintain internal controls;\n- \u00b7 establish and monitor the effectiveness of the risk management and compliance management system, and monitor and manage all material risks consistent with the strategic objectives, risk appetite statements and policies approved by the Board;\n- \u00b7 provide the Board with accurate, timely and clear information on the Group's operations, including on compliance with material legal and regulatory requirements and any conduct materially inconsistent with the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct;\n- \u00b7 inform the Board of material matters and keep the Board and market fully informed about material continuous disclosure; and\n- \u00b7 monitor that succession plans exist for all Group executive positions other than the Group Chief Executive Officer. The succession plans for the Group Chief Executive Officer are managed by the Governance & Nomination Committee, and are discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility to the Group Chief Executive Officer for the day-to-day management of the business.\n\nQBE has operated under an extensive written system of delegated authorities for many years. In particular, a written delegated authority with specified limits is approved by the Board each year to enable the Group Chief Executive Officer to conduct QBE's business in accordance with detailed budgets and business plans. This delegated authority deals with topics such as underwriting, reinsurance protection, claims, investments, acquisitions and expenses. The Group Chief Executive Officer delegates authority to management throughout the Group on a selective basis, taking into account expertise and past performance. Compliance with delegated authorities is monitored by management and adjusted as required based on performance, market conditions and other factors. Management and the Group's internal audit teams review compliance with delegated authorities and a breach can lead to disciplinary procedures, including dismissal.",

        "page_content": "## Chair\n\nThe independent Chair of the Board is Mike Wilkins AO, who was appointed to that role in March 2020. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that the Board functions as an effective and cohesive group. The Chair works closely with the Group Chief Executive Officer to determine the strategic direction for QBE and to establish high standards of governance and leadership.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Board is supported by several Committees which meet regularly to consider audit, risk management, investments, remuneration, technology, operations and other matters. The main Committees of the Board are the Audit, Governance & Nomination, Investment, Operations & Technology, People & Remuneration and Risk & Capital Committees. Further sub-committees of the Board may be convened to confer on particular issues from time to time. Any non-executive director may attend a Committee meeting. The Board is considering how the work of some Committees could be streamlined and accordingly there may be changes to some Committees in 2022.\n\nThe Committees have free and unfettered access to QBE's senior managers and may consult external advisers at QBE's cost, including requiring their attendance at Committee meetings, with the consent of the Committee Chair. A report on each Committee's last meeting is provided at the next Board meeting.\n\nEach Committee comprises at least three independent directors and each Committee Chair is an independent director who is not the Chair of the Board (excluding the Governance & Nomination Committee, the Chair of which is Mike Wilkins). Each Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. These charters are available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/ corporate-governance/qbe-charters-and-constitution. The membership of each Committee is provided at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/ group-board-of-directors and details of the number of Committee meetings held during the 2021 financial year and attendance by Committee members at Committee meetings is set out in the Directors' Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information regarding the Committees can be found throughout this corporate governance statement.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and all of the Committees and is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. All directors have direct access to the Company Secretary.\n\nThe Company Secretary's role is described in the Board Charter and includes communication with regulatory bodies and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), all statutory and other filings and assisting with good information flows within the Board and its Committees and between non-executive directors and senior management, as well as facilitating induction and professional development as required. The Company Secretary may also provide guidance to directors in relation to governance matters.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nDirectors are selected to provide to QBE a broad range of skills, experience and expertise complementary to QBE's insurance activities. The Board comprised 10 directors at 31 December 2021, being an independent Chair, Group Chief Executive Officer and eight other independent directors.\n\nThe Board has a skills matrix covering the range of competencies and experience of each director. When the need for a new director is identified, the required experience and competencies of the new director are considered in the context of this matrix and any gaps that may exist.\n\nThe Board's skills matrix is summarised below:\n\n## SKILLS\n\n## INDUSTRY\n\n| Financial literacy   | Government relations   |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Legal                | Executive leadership   |\n| Governance           | Digital technology     |\n| Strategy             | Cyber security         |\n| Commercial expertise | IT risks               |\n| Risk management      | Data analytics         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral insurance\n\nPrivate equity\n\nReinsurance\n\nFinancial services\n\nInvestment banking\n\nAccounting\n\n- Details of individual directors, including their qualifications and experience, independence status and period of Board tenure, are set out in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report and can also be found on the QBE website at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/group-board-of-directors.\n\n## Independence of the Board\n\nDuring the 2021 year, the majority of the directors on the Board were independent directors, applying the 'independence' definition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council. When applying this definition, the Board has determined that an independent director's relationship with QBE as a professional adviser, consultant, supplier, customer or otherwise is not material unless amounts paid under that relationship exceed 0.1% of QBE's revenue. The roles of the Chair and Group Chief Executive Officer are generally also not exercised by the same individual.\n\nDirectors are required to advise the Board on an ongoing basis of any interest they have that they believe could conflict with QBE's interests. If a potential conflict does arise, either the director concerned may choose not to, or the Board may decide that he or she should not, receive documents or take part in Board discussions while the matter is being considered. Conflicts of interest, including related party transactions, are a standing agenda item and are considered by the Board at each Board meeting.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\n## Tenure\n\nThe mere fact that a director has served on the Board for a lengthy period of time does not, of itself, suggest a lack of independence; however, the Board has agreed that a non-executive director's term should be approximately 10 years. Under the Company's Constitution, there is no maximum fixed term or retirement age for non-executive directors. The Board considers that a mandatory limit on tenure would deprive the Group of valuable and relevant corporate experience in the complex world of international general insurance and reinsurance. John M Green has been a non-executive director since 2010 and Deputy Chair since 2015. He was re-elected as a director at the 2019 Annual General Meeting (AGM). QBE's other directors believe that Mr Green continues to exercise independent judgement and, through his QBE experience, makes an important contribution. The tenure of each director is set out in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report and can also be found on the QBE website at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/group-board-of-directors.\n\nThe Constitution provides that no director, except the Group Chief Executive Officer, shall hold office for a continuous period in excess of three years or past the third AGM following a director's appointment, whichever is the longer, without submission for individual re-election.\n\n## Board and senior executive selection process\n\nThe Board has a Governance & Nomination Committee which meets regularly during the year around the time of the Board meetings. The Committee assists the Board in appointing directors so that the Board as a whole has the necessary range of skills, knowledge and experience to be effective. The Committee also assists the Board in managing the succession plans for the Group Chief Executive Officer and reviewing succession plans for members of the Group Executive Committee. The Governance & Nomination Committee is comprised of all the non-executive directors of the Board and is chaired by Mike Wilkins.\n\nA formal process for the selection and appointment of directors or senior executives is undertaken by the Governance & Nomination Committee and Board. Appropriate background checks are undertaken before the Board appoints a new director or senior executive or puts forward a candidate for election. External consultants may be employed, where necessary, to search for prospective directors. Candidates are assessed against the required skills and on their qualifications, background and personal qualities.\n\nFor Board appointments, candidates must also have the required time to commit to the position. The Board regularly reviews the mix of skills that is required to operate effectively. Under the Constitution, the size of the Board is limited to 12 directors. The Board considers that a maximum of 12 directors reflects the largest realistic size of the Board that is consistent with:\n\n- \u00b7 maintaining the Board's efficiency and cohesion in carrying out its governance duties on behalf of shareholders;\n- \u00b7 reducing the risk of a director being insufficiently involved in, and informed about, the business of QBE; and\n- \u00b7 providing individual directors with greater potential to contribute and participate.\n\nQBE also provides shareholders with all material information in its possession that is relevant to a decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director through a number of channels, such as the notice of meeting, director biographies and other information contained in the Annual Report.\n\nUpon appointment, each non-executive director and senior executive is provided with a written agreement which sets out the terms of their appointment.\n\nThe Board believes that orderly succession and renewal contribute to strong corporate governance and are achieved by careful planning and continual review. As an ongoing evaluation, the Board regularly discusses its composition in relation to the mix of skills, diversity and geographic location of directors to meet the needs of QBE.\n\n## Director induction and training\n\nUpon appointment, directors attend induction sessions where they are briefed on QBE's history, DNA, strategy, financials, and risk management and governance frameworks.\n\nThe Board obtains the information it requires to be effective including, where necessary, independent professional advice.\n\nA non-executive director may seek such advice at QBE's cost with the consent of the Chair. Directors are also provided with ongoing professional development and training programs to enable them to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge at QBE's cost, with the consent of the Chair. Non-executive directors are required to complete continuing professional development each year, including on insurance, customer and regulatory matters.",

The Board regularly reviews its performance through internal and external assessments, and recommendations for either improvement or increased focus are agreed and promptly implemented.\n\nA Board performance evaluation was conducted in 2021 for the 2020 year. The review covered the performance of boards and committees at both the Group and divisional levels.\n\n## People & Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board has a People & Remuneration Committee which meets at least quarterly to assist it in, amongst other things, overseeing major remuneration practices of QBE. The People & Remuneration Committee is comprised of independent directors and is chaired by John M Green.\n\n## Performance evaluation - senior executives\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee oversees the performance of senior executives. In addition, the Board continually monitors the performance of senior executives through regular review and reporting.\n\nIn 2021, QBE used a balanced scorecard of an individual's achievement against specific strategic priorities. Other than as set out in the Remuneration Report, senior executives have 35% of their short-term incentive plan outcome determined with reference to individual objectives.\n\nThe scorecard is aligned to QBE's business plans and measures performance against objectives, which supported QBE's strategic objectives in 2021. The Remuneration Report sets out a summary of the key objectives and outcomes against these for the executive key management personnel.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive Officer's and Interim Group Chief Executive Officer's (26 October 2020 - 31 August 2021) scorecards were formulated initially through a discussion between them and the Chair and were approved by the Board. Consistent with the Group Chief Executive Officer's scorecard, the scorecards for the other senior executives align with QBE's business plans and support the strategic priorities. The approval and assessment process for the senior executives' scorecards is completed by the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\nA senior executives' performance evaluation was conducted for the 2021 year, with reference to their performance against agreed 2021 objectives.\n\n## Remuneration policies and practices\n\nDetails of QBE's policies and practices regarding the remuneration of executives and non-executive directors (being key management personnel) are set out in the Remuneration Report.\n\nOther than meeting statutory superannuation requirements, QBE does not have in place any retirement benefit schemes for non-executive directors.\n\nQBE's Securities Trading Policy outlines QBE's approach to derivatives or otherwise limiting the economic risk of participating in an equity-based remuneration scheme, and is available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Group governance\n\n## Governance frameworks\n\nQBE has a Board-approved Group governance framework that sets out five overarching governance principles that support best practice governance across QBE and is designed to encourage collective accountability across Group Head Office and the divisions.\n\nThe framework defines the roles, responsibilities and composition of the Group and divisional boards and committees to facilitate the governance surrounding appropriate guidance and oversight of the business. The framework also strengthens the relationship and information flows between the Group and divisional boards and committees, so they can work together to achieve the best possible outcomes for QBE.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\n## QBE DNA\n\nEverything we do at QBE is underpinned by our QBE DNA, which consists of seven interwoven elements. These elements describe who we are and what we stand for, and outline the standards and behaviours we expect from our employees to achieve our goals and fulfil our purpose.\n\nAt QBE, when we show up for our customers, shareholders, communities and each other:\n\n- \u00b7 we are customer-focused;\n- \u00b7 we are technical experts;\n- \u00b7 we are inclusive;\n- \u00b7 we are fast-paced;\n- \u00b7 we are courageous;\n- \u00b7 we are accountable; and\n- \u00b7 we are a team.\n\nThe QBE DNA is set and approved by the Board, with the GEC responsible for bringing the elements to life throughout the organisation through our day-to-day interactions as well through our recruitment, onboarding, performance, reward, leadership, feedback, learning and communication practices.\n\nEmployees' demonstration of the QBE DNA is integral to how strategic performance objectives are measured. At the end of the performance year, employees are assessed in terms of both what they have achieved and how they have achieved it - whether their behaviours were aligned to the QBE DNA. This in turn links to reward outcomes and is applicable for all employees, including senior executives.\n\nThe Group Code of Ethics and Conduct addresses the responsibilities employees have to the Group, to each other and to customers, suppliers, communities and governments. It provides clear guidance to help employees apply good judgement and make considered decisions that exemplify the QBE DNA.\n\n## Group policies\n\nQBE maintains a suite of Group policies commensurate with a mature and well-run organisation. QBE policies are governed by a global policy framework designed to establish consistent policy design and management requirements. Group policies serve as vital conduits to facilitate an understanding of the Group's compliance and conduct expectations. QBE's approach in key compliance areas recognises that employees (including contractors, directors and agents) are key to maintaining a compliant and ethical approach to QBE's business practices. Most global policies are supported by Group standards and procedures that provide additional information and guidance to support employees.\n\nThe Group Code of Ethics and Conduct applies to all employees as well as directors, agents and contractors. The Group Code of Ethics and Conduct is complemented by the Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy, which was last updated in December 2021 for release in 2022. The Board oversees, and receives reports on compliance with amongst other things, the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct. The Group Conflicts of Interest Policy operates in conjunction with the Group Gift and Entertainment Policy, to create a system to identify and report actual, perceived or potential conflicts of interest. In recognition of the importance of protecting employee and customer data across QBE, we have a global privacy framework that is periodically reviewed and updated to reflect developments in privacy laws across the global footprint.\n\nQBE's policy framework also addresses sanctions, outsourcing, modern slavery, anti-bribery and corruption, health, safety and wellbeing, continuous disclosure, diversity and inclusion, securities trading, flexible working, supplier sustainability, and environment and energy. Policy summaries are available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies. Material breaches and incidents relating to the policies within the policy framework, including the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy, are required to be recorded and reported to the Board.\n\nGlobal policies are also in place to address the prudential requirements of APRA, including risk management, cyber risk, business continuity management, reinsurance management, fitness and propriety and material outsourcing.\n\nIn Australia, QBE complies with the General Insurance Code of Practice, an industry code relating to the provision of products and services to customers of the general insurance industry in Australia. The Code Governance Committee is the independent body that monitors and enforces insurers' compliance with the Code. The General Insurance Code of Practice will also have sections that are enforceable by ASIC. Discussion as to identification of relevant sections is ongoing with ASIC and the Insurance Council of Australia. QBE's Australian business is also a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the external dispute resolution scheme that deals with complaints from consumers related to financial services.",

During 2021 we saw an increase from 34.8% to 35.9% women in leadership, and maintained 33.3% women on our Board. Action plans and succession planning continue to progress the diversity of our leadership and our Board.\n\nDetails of gender representation across our workforce and management levels together with targets are set out below:\n\n| FEMALE REPRESENTATION                               | GENDER   TARGET BY 2025   | ACTUAL  31 DECEMBER 2021   | ACTUAL  31 DECEMBER 2020   | ACTUAL  31 DECEMBER 2019   | ACTUAL  31 DECEMBER 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Board                                               | 40%                       | 33.3%                      | 33.3%                      | 22.2%                      | 22.2%                      |\n| GEC                                                 |                           | 45.5%                      | 30.0%                      | 27.3%                      | 27.3%                      |\n| Level 1                                             |                           | 28.3%                      | 25.5%                      | 19.6%                      | 23.1%                      |\n| Level 2                                             |                           | 32.0%                      | 29.4%                      | 28.8%                      | 25.7%                      |\n| Level 3                                             |                           | 36.9%                      | 36.3%                      | 35.3%                      | 33.8%                      |\n| Women in leadership (total % of GEC and levels 1-3) | 40%                       | 35.9%                      | 34.8%                      | 33.7%                      | 32.0%                      |\n| Women in workforce                                  | 40% to 60%                | 52.2%                      | 52.0%                      | 52.2%                      | 52.7%                      |",

QBE also makes an annual filing to comply with the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) (WGEA) in Australia disclosing our performance against the 'Gender Equality Indicators'. The report can be found at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Communications with shareholders\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nQBE is committed to regularly communicating with its shareholders and other stakeholders in a timely and accessible manner, and encouraging shareholder participation at its AGM. Detailed information about QBE can be found on the website at www.qbe.com including:\n\n- \u00b7 its history;\n- \u00b7 the Board and management;\n- \u00b7 its Constitution, Board charter and the charters of each of its Committees;\n- \u00b7 corporate governance and policies;\n- \u00b7 periodic disclosures, including annual reports, half year reports and sustainability reports;\n- \u00b7 ASX announcements;\n- \u00b7 shareholder calendar;\n- \u00b7 notices of meeting and any accompanying documents;\n- \u00b7 presentation materials provided at investor and analyst briefings; and\n- \u00b7 webcasts of meetings of shareholders and investor and analyst briefings.\n\nThe QBE website includes a dedicated investor relations section where shareholders can access relevant information regarding their shares. There is also a direct link where shareholders can access their shareholding online through QBE's share registry, Computershare. They can update their personal information and provide their email address and elect to receive communications electronically. Shareholders can discuss their shareholding with either QBE's shareholder services department by email to shares@qbe.com or by contacting QBE's share registry, Computershare, by email to qbe.queries@computershare.com.au or by phone at +61 3 9415 4840. Shareholders may request to receive a hard copy of the Annual Report by updating their communication preferences by logging into their shareholding at www.investorcentre.com/au.\n\nQBE has a comprehensive investor relations program that facilitates effective communication with its investors. The Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group General Counsel and Company Secretary, Global Head of Investor Relations, Group Executive, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability, Group Treasurer and divisional chief executives generally deal with analysts, investors, media, rating agencies and others, taking account of regulatory guidelines including those issued by the ASX on continuous disclosure. The presentations on the 30 June and 31 December results and other major presentations are sent to the ASX before the presentations commence and are available promptly at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/ reports-presentations. The 30 June and 31 December results presentations are also webcast live and subsequently archived at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/reports-presentations.\n\n## Annual General Meetings\n\nQBE welcomes and encourages shareholder participation at its AGM, in person, online or by proxy. The AGM is held in Sydney each year. In 2021, QBE held a hybrid AGM in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shareholders were able to:\n\n- \u00b7 participate by attending the meeting in person, watching online or dialling in to the teleconference;\n- \u00b7 ask questions in person, online or on the telephone once they were verified; and\n- \u00b7 vote by appointing a proxy, direct voting prior to the AGM and direct voting online during the AGM.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\nWithin the required statutory period before each AGM, QBE distributes to shareholders a notice of meeting and proxy form in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , the ASX Listing Rules and the Company's Constitution. To encourage effective participation at AGMs, QBE:\n\n- \u00b7 issues notices of meeting that are honest, accurate and not misleading;\n- \u00b7 includes explanatory notes for all resolutions included in the notice;\n- \u00b7 provides a proxy appointment form which clearly indicates how a shareholder may appoint a proxy, direct their proxy how to vote on a particular resolution if they so choose and, if they appoint the Chair of the meeting as their proxy, how the Chair intends to vote undirected proxies;\n- \u00b7 only combines or 'bundles' resolutions in notices of meeting in limited circumstances; and\n- \u00b7 provides shareholders with the opportunity to lodge proxies electronically.\n\nShareholders are encouraged to provide questions or comments ahead of the AGM so that these can be addressed at the meeting. QBE will make directors, members of the management team and the external auditor available to shareholders at the AGM to respond to questions regarding the items of business, including about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the auditor's report.\n\nVotes at the AGM are by way of a poll, i.e. one vote for each fully paid ordinary share held.\n\n## Continuous disclosure\n\nQBE takes its continuous disclosure obligations seriously and issues market releases during the year to satisfy those obligations. Significant developments affecting QBE may be the subject of an announcement to the ASX. All ASX announcements are placed on QBE's website at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/asx-announcements as soon as practicable after release. The Board and relevant management also receive copies of all material market announcements promptly after they have been made. QBE's Continuous Disclosure Policy is available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Verification of periodic corporate reports\n\nQBE prepares periodic corporate reports for the benefit of investors such as annual reports, half year reports and sustainability reports. QBE follows a robust process for satisfying itself that the report is materially accurate and balanced, and that it provides investors with appropriate information to make investment decisions.\n\nPeriodic corporate reports are drafted by staff with direct responsibility for, or expertise in, the subject matter and are supported by evidence, including by documenting the various sources of information and consultation undertaken within QBE or with external parties. The information is then reviewed by senior management who have the knowledge and skills to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided. QBE uses an independent assurance engagement to confirm that certain data in the annual sustainability report has been prepared and presented appropriately in all material aspects.\n\nThe Board and its Committees review and approve statutory and other significant corporate reports prior to release to the market. All other periodic corporate reports are submitted for approval to the Disclosure Committee, a committee comprised of senior executives including the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Financial and other reporting\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Board has an Audit Committee which meets at least quarterly to support the Board in overseeing the effectiveness of the Group's financial reporting and risk management framework. In particular, the Audit Committee oversees and monitors the integrity of the Group's financial reporting, including climate-related financial disclosures. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing the management of tax risks. The Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors, all of whom have financial expertise, and is chaired by Jann Skinner.\n\n## Group Chief Executive O/fficer and Group Chief Financial O/fficer declaration\n\nPrior to the Audit Committee's review and the Board's approval of the 2021 Annual Report, the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer provided a declaration to the Board that, in their opinion, the financial records were properly maintained, that the financial statements complied with the appropriate accounting standards and that they gave a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of QBE. The declaration also provides that the opinion of the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer was based on a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating effectively.\n\n## External auditor independence\n\nQBE firmly believes that the external auditor must be, and must be seen to be, independent. The external auditor confirms its independence and the Audit Committee verifies this by separate enquiry. The Audit Committee regularly meets with the external auditor in the absence of management. The external auditor attends the AGM and a representative is available to answer questions from shareholders relevant to the audit.\n\nThe Audit Committee has free and unfettered access to the external auditor. The external auditor has free and unfettered access to the Audit Committee.",

        "page_content": "QBE has issued an internal policy on external auditor independence. Under this policy, the external auditor is not allowed to provide the excluded services of preparing accounting records, financial reports or asset or liability valuations. Furthermore, it cannot act in a management capacity, as an advocate, as a custodian of assets or as a share registry.\n\nThe Board believes some non-audit services are appropriate given the external auditor's knowledge of the QBE Group. QBE may engage the external auditor for some non-audit services, subject to the general principle that fees for non-audit services excluding audit-related and assurance services should not exceed 50% of all fees paid to the external auditor in any one financial year. External tax services are generally provided by an accounting firm other than the external auditor.\n\nThe Audit Committee approves the audit plan each year and receives information on the external auditor's fees. QBE also considers the terms of engagement of the external auditor every few years. The Corporations Act 2001 and Australian professional auditing standards require rotation of the lead engagement partner after five years. The lead engagement partner of the external auditor was last rotated in 2019.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly reviews the need to rotate external auditors and if the Audit Committee thought it appropriate to change the firm undertaking QBE's external audit, it would conduct a competitive tender process.\n\n## Actuarial review\n\nThe central estimate of QBE's insurance liabilities, comprising outstanding claims and premium liabilities, is determined by experienced internal actuarial staff. Actuarial staff form an independent view of both the central estimate and the probability of adequacy of outstanding claims and premium liabilities. At 31 December 2021, close to 100% of QBE's outstanding claims central estimate was also reviewed by external actuaries.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nA global internal audit function is a core part of QBE's three lines of defence approach to effective risk management. QBE's Group Internal Audit team is an independent global function that operates on an integrated basis and is managed by the Group Head of Internal Audit. Group Internal Audit is formally accountable to the Chair of the Audit Committee and has an operational reporting line to the Group Chief Financial Officer. Group Internal Audit operates under an Audit Committee-approved internal audit charter that provides Group Internal Audit with free and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, and all management, records and properties.\n\nGroup Internal Audit's primary purpose is to assist the Audit Committee and senior management to discharge their responsibility for sound and prudent management of risk at QBE. Group Internal Audit does this by performing audits, reviews and investigations to provide independent assurance that the design and operation of controls across QBE's international operations are effective.\n\nGroup Internal Audit develops and delivers an annual risk-based internal audit plan that is aligned to QBE's risk management framework and includes audits to address relevant regulatory requirements. The annual Group Internal Audit plan is designed so that higher materiality risk processes are reviewed more frequently. Audit findings and related themes are reported to management, local audit committees and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Risk management\n\nQBE is in the business of managing risk. The Board and management are fully committed to adopting a disciplined approach to managing risk, delivering leading practice and maintaining robust and independent risk management processes and systems.\n\nQBE's risk management framework supports its businesses across all divisions and provides a sound foundation for reducing uncertainty and volatility in business performance.\n\nFurther details of how QBE manages risk are set out in the Group Chief Risk Officer's report and the climate change section of the Annual Report on pages 28 to 37. An overview of QBE's risk management framework, including QBE's material economic risks and how these are mitigated, is also set out in note 4 to the financial statements.\n\n## Risk & Capital Committee\n\nThe Board monitors QBE's performance and, as such, plays a significant role in monitoring that an effective risk management strategy is established and maintained. The Board has a Risk & Capital Committee which meets at least quarterly to support the Board in overseeing the effectiveness of QBE's risk and capital management frameworks. The proper oversight of these frameworks supports strategic objectives, informs business plans and enables current and future risks to be identified, assessed and monitored in line with risk appetite. Under its charter, the Risk & Capital Committee is required to review the risk management framework periodically to confirm it continues to be sound. This review was undertaken during 2021 as part of the annual refresh of the Risk Management Strategy. The Risk & Capital Committee is also responsible for overseeing QBE's ESG responsibilities and performance, and external reporting relating to this.\n\nThe Risk & Capital Committee is comprised of independent directors and is chaired by Rolf Tolle. The Risk & Capital Committee has free and unfettered access to the Group Chief Risk Officer and other relevant senior management.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nInformation about how QBE approaches sustainability and the management of ESG issues can be found in the climate change disclosures section on pages 30 to 37 of the Annual Report and in the 2021 Sustainability Report available at www.qbe.com/sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Refer to QBE's 2021 Sustainability Report at www.qbe.com/sustainability.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The current year profit reflects a material turnaround from the prior year which included a significant underwriting loss due to COVID-19, adverse prior accident year claims development, and impairments of North American goodwill and deferred tax assets.\n\nGross written premium increased by $3,814 million mainly due to premium rate increases, improved retention and new business growth across the Group, with particularly strong growth in Crop. Reinsurance expense increased by $1,327 million, mainly reflecting the cost of reinsuring certain prior accident year Australian compulsory third party motor (CTP) liabilities ($365 million) combined with growth in more heavily reinsured portfolios and the higher cost of renewal of the Group's main catastrophe and per risk treaties.\n\nThe Group reported an underwriting profit of $1,138 million compared with a loss of $869 million in the prior year, equating to a combined operating ratio of 91.5% compared with 107.4%. Excluding the impacts of changes in risk-free rates, the combined operating ratio was 93.7% compared with 104.2% in the prior year.\n\nThe net claims ratio was 62.4% compared with 76.3% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in risk-free rates, the net claims ratio was 64.6% compared with 73.1%, with the improvement reflecting the aforementioned CTP reinsurance transaction ($349 million), the reduced impact of COVID-19 claims (a net release of $141 million compared with a cost of $560 million in the prior year), and a reduced level of adverse prior accident year claims development relative to the prior year.",

        "page_content": "The combined commission and expense ratio decreased to 29.1% from 31.1% in the prior year. The net commission ratio reduced to 15.5% from 16.1% in the prior year, primarily due to business mix changes in North America and Australia Pacific. The Group's expense ratio decreased to 13.6% from 15.0% in the prior year, mainly reflecting disciplined cost management and operating leverage driven by strong premium growth.\n\nTotal investment income was $122 million compared with $226 million in the prior year, reflecting the adverse impact of higher risk-free rates partly offset by improved returns on growth assets.\n\nThe Group's effective tax rate was 17% compared with negative 3% in the prior year reflecting the mix of corporate tax rates in the jurisdictions in which QBE operates and the utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses in the North American tax group. The prior year tax rate was also impacted by the non-deductible impairment of goodwill and derecognition of deferred tax assets in North America.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe directors are announcing a final dividend of 19 Australian cents per share, 10% franked, compared with no final dividend for the prior year. The 2021 full year dividend payout is A$443 million compared with A$59 million for 2020. Further details of dividends paid during the year are set out in note 5.4 to the financial statements.\n\nThe directors have reassessed the Group's dividend policy and expect to pay out 40%-60% of annual adjusted cash profit. This approach will better support the Group's growth ambitions and provide flexibility to manage the dynamics of the global insurance cycle.\n\n## Activities\n\nThe principal activities of QBE during the year were underwriting general insurance and reinsurance risks, management of Lloyd's syndicates and investment management.\n\n## Presentation currency\n\nThe Group has presented the Financial Report in US dollars because a significant proportion of its underwriting activity is denominated in US dollars. The US dollar is also the currency that is widely understood by the global insurance industry, international investors and analysts.\n\n## Operating and financial review\n\nInformation on the Group's results, operations, business strategy, prospects and financial position is set out in the operating and financial review on pages 10 to 21 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Outstanding claims liability\n\nThe net central estimate of outstanding claims is determined by the Group Chief Actuary. The assessment takes into account the statistical analysis of past claims, allowance for claims incurred but not reported, reinsurance and other recoveries and future interest and inflation factors.\n\nAs in previous years, the directors consider that substantial risk margins are required to mitigate the inherent uncertainty in the net central estimate. The probability of adequacy of the outstanding claims liability at 31 December 2021 was 91.7% compared with 92.5% last year. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) prudential standards provide a capital credit for risk margins in excess of a probability of adequacy of 75%.\n\n## Group indemnities\n\nRule 78 of the Company's Constitution provides that the Company indemnifies past and present directors, secretaries or other officers against any liability incurred by that person as a director, secretary or other officer of the Company or its subsidiaries. The indemnity does not apply to any liability (excluding legal costs):\n\n- \u00b7 owed to the Company or a related body corporate (e.g. breach of directors' duties);\n- \u00b7 for a pecuniary penalty under section 1317G or a compensation order under sections 1317H or 1317HA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (or a similar provision of the corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction); or\n- \u00b7 that is owed to someone other than the Company or a related body corporate and which did not arise out of conduct in good faith.\n\nThe indemnity extends to legal costs other than where:\n\n- \u00b7 in civil proceedings, one or more of the above exclusions apply;\n- \u00b7 in criminal proceedings, the person is found guilty;\n- \u00b7 the person is liable in proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), a corresponding regulator in another jurisdiction or a liquidator (unless as part of the investigation before proceedings are commenced); or\n- \u00b7 the court does not grant relief after an application under the Corporations Act 2001 or corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, a deed exists between the Company and each director which includes an indemnity in similar terms to rule 78 of the Company's Constitution.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\nD\n\nR\n\ni\n\nr\n\ne\n\np\n\ne\n\no\n\nr\n\nct\n\nt\n\no\n\nrs\n\n'\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report\n\n## continued\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021\n\n## Directors' and officers' insurance\n\nQBE pays a premium each year in respect of a contract insuring directors, secretaries, senior managers and employees of the Group together with any natural person who is either a trustee or a member of a policy committee for a superannuation plan established for the benefit of the Group's employees against liabilities past, present or future. The officers of the Group covered by the insurance contract include the directors listed on pages 38 and 39 of this Annual Report, the Group Company Secretary, Carolyn Scobie, and Deputy Company Secretary, Peter Smiles.\n\nIn accordance with normal commercial practice, disclosure of the amount of premium payable under, and the nature of liabilities covered by, the insurance contract is prohibited by a confidentiality clause in the contract.\n\nNo such insurance cover has been provided for the benefit of any external auditor of the Group.\n\n## Significant changes\n\nThere were no significant changes in the Group's state of affairs during the financial year other than as disclosed in this Annual Report.\n\n## Likely developments and expected results of operations\n\nLikely developments in the Group's operations in future financial years and the expected results of those operations have been included in the operating and financial review on pages 10 to 21 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Events after balance date\n\nOther than the declaration of the final dividend, no matter or circumstance has arisen since 31 December 2021 that, in the opinion of the directors, has significantly affected or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations or the Group's state of affairs in future financial periods.\n\n## Material business risks\n\nAs a global insurance and reinsurance business, QBE is subject to a substantial variety of business risks. The directors believe that effective management of these risks is critical to delivering value for QBE's stakeholders. It is QBE's policy to adopt a rigorous approach to managing risk throughout the Group. Risk management is a continuous process and an integral part of QBE's governance structure, QBE's broader business processes and, most importantly, QBE's culture.\n\nSome of the material business risks that QBE faces include strategic, insurance, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and Group risks. Explanations of these risks and their mitigations are set out in detail in note 4 to the financial statements which we recommend you read. Further details of how QBE manages risk are set out in the Group Chief Risk Officer's Report on pages 28 to 29, the climate change section on pages 30 to 37 and the risk management section of the corporate governance statement on page 51 of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group makes judgements and estimates in respect of the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the most significant of which are in relation to the determination of the net outstanding claims liability, the application of the liability adequacy test and the valuation of deferred tax assets and impairment testing of goodwill in North America. Details of these, and information on how QBE has responded to uncertainties created by COVID-19, are included in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Meetings of directors\n\nMEETINGS OF COMMITTEES\n\n|                 | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE                       | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE                       | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE     | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE     | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE              | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE              | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                 | FULL  MEETINGS OF  DIRECTORS/one.numerator | FULL  MEETINGS OF  DIRECTORS/one.numerator | OF  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS | OF  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS | AUDIT                  | AUDIT                  | &  NOMINATION          | &  NOMINATION          | INVESTMENT             | INVESTMENT             | OPERATIONS &  TECHNOLOGY | OPERATIONS &  TECHNOLOGY | PEOPLE & RE/hyphen.cap MUNERATION | PEOPLE & RE/hyphen.cap MUNERATION | RISK &  CAPITAL        | RISK &  CAPITAL        | SUB/hyphen.cap COMMITTEES | SUB/hyphen.cap COMMITTEES |\n|                 | H                                          | A                                          | H                         | A                         | H                      | A                      | H                      | A                      | H                      | A                      | H                        | A                        | H                                 | A                                 | H                      | A                      | H                         | A                         |\n| Stephen         |                                            |                                            |                           |                           |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |                        |                          |                          |                                   |                                   |                        |                        |                           |                           |\n| Fitzgerald      | 11                                         | 10                                         | 6                         | 6                         | -

A strong return to profitability was achieved with a Group adjusted cash return on equity (ROE) of 10.3% whilst our balance sheet continued to strengthen. Relative to initial expectations, COVID-19 impacts were more benign through 2021 than expected, though our teams have nonetheless remained focused in light of considerable uncertainty across our key markets. From the strong foundations evident in this result, we expect further momentum in the business as our new purpose, vision and six strategic priorities are embedded across the Group and our culture.\n\nDuring 2021, we also welcomed a number of new executives and, as foreshadowed in last year's report, carried out a broader review of remuneration arrangements to address the incoming regulatory requirements across the Australian financial services sector.\n\n- For more information about the changes for 2022, refer to page 59.\n\nIn a challenging year, we are pleased with the results our people have achieved for your Company and delivered for our customers.\n\n- For more information on how we performed in 2021, refer to pages 60-61.\n\n## Executive changes\n\nAs announced in March 2021, we appointed a new Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Andrew Horton, who commenced in September 2021, replacing Interim Group CEO, Richard Pryce. Mr Horton was also appointed an executive director of QBE effective 1 September 2021.\n\nMr Horton's experience in the insurance sector provides QBE with refreshed rigour having driven positive change and high performance in his previous roles. Upon Mr Horton's commencement, Mr Pryce transitioned to an advisory role and retired in December 2021.\n\nWe also welcomed Fiona Larnach as the Group Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Sue Houghton as CEO, Australia Pacific. Pleasingly, we promoted two members of our senior management to the Group Executive being Sam Harrison to the role of Group Chief Underwriting Officer and Amanda Hughes to the role of Group Executive, People and Culture.\n\nIt has been encouraging to see tangible benefit from our efforts to build our internal talent pipeline to fill a number of these roles. We are confident that these most recent executive changes provide QBE with the capability to continue to build the momentum across the business for future success.\n\nThere were no changes in non-executive director membership or fees during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information, refer to page 77.\n\n## People, culture and inclusion\n\nThere continued to be a strong commitment to the wellbeing of our people in 2021.\n\nHaving regard to both physical and mental health during the year, we evolved our employee listening strategy to better connect with our people. The former annual engagement and enablement survey is now carried out through more frequent, shorter and tailored pulse surveys. Through these, we have started to deliver on our ambition for a modernised listening approach at QBE and we are able to gather important insights into how our people are feeling. Our focus is on four key dimensions: wellbeing, respect, inclusion and risk.\n\nOur progress on the 'Culture Accelerator' program during 2021 has provided a solid base from which to build. The activities carried out as part of the program, which were to refine and enhance our DNA and support our journey towards making QBE more future-fit, have seen significant traction. A refreshed DNA and shared language for calling out behaviour were launched in October 2021 and sponsorship of a number of culture-related initiatives will continue into 2022.\n\nThe development of a renewed approach to inclusion occurred during 2021 with the formal launch of a new Inclusion of Diversity policy in early 2022. The change in terminology is representative of the fact that inclusion is needed to both foster and unlock the value of diversity and QBE's continued commitment and focus in this area.\n\nPleasingly, during the year, QBE became one of the first organisations in Australia certified as a Family Friendly Workplace and is a founding partner of the National Work + Family Standards, launched in",

In addition, we have been recognised in the Top 100 of Equileap's 2021 Gender Equality Global Report & Ranking for progressing our gender equality agenda and included in the 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.\n\n- For more information, refer to QBE's Sustainability Report at www.qbe.com/sustainability.\n\n## Performance during 2021\n\nThe Group's 2021 financial result was pleasing as we have seen a strong return to profitability and growth in comparison to 2020. Across the three divisions of North America, International and Australia Pacific, strong premium growth and progress against key initiatives was delivered against a backdrop of heightened natural catastrophe activity. The Group's statutory combined operating ratio (COR) (excluding the impact of changes in risk-free rates) was 93.7% compared with 104.2% in 2020 and the Group cash ROE of 10.3% compared with (10.9)% in 2020.\n\nFor 2021 incentives, the Group COR used to determine short-term incentive (STI) calculations is based on a blend of divisional COR outcomes. This results in a payout of 93.9%. The non-financial component of the STI for the executive KMP, the ME@QBE component, was determined by the Board and outcomes ranged from 100% to 120%.\n\nBased on the above, overall STI outcomes for the current executive KMP ranged from 80% to 128% of their target. The 2021 STI outcome for the Group CEO reflects his part year in the role. Based on this, he will receive 115.2% of his target opportunity (76.8%% of his maximum opportunity). For the other executive KMP, the average STI outcome is 73% of their maximum opportunity.\n\nThere was no executive KMP long-term incentive (LTI) due to vest during 2021.\n\n- For more information on 2021 performance and STI outcomes, refer to pages 60-64.\n\nThis Remuneration Report sets out QBE's remuneration framework and provides detail of remuneration outcomes for key management personnel (KMP) for 2021 and how this aligns with QBE's performance.\n\nAccounting standards define KMP as those executives and non-executive directors with the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, either directly or indirectly.\n\nThe 2021 Remuneration Report has been prepared and audited in accordance with the disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Changes for 2022\n\nFor 2022, we have continued to evolve our remuneration arrangements to support our future direction and proactively respond to the upcoming regulatory requirements in Australia.\n\nA number of changes were introduced in 2021 such as the revised malus and new clawback provisions, and we will continue to transition further in 2022 and 2023.\n\nFor STI in 2022 we will be taking a broader view of performance and will include overall enterprise financial and also non-financial performance including risk, people and strategic measures. The detail of the measures will be provided along with the outcomes at the end of the performance year and will consider both qualitative and quantitative factors. In addition, executive KMP STI deferral periods will be lengthened from vesting across two years to four years.\n\nWe will also simplify the LTI award in 2022. Whilst the use of average Group cash ROE and relative total shareholder return (TSR) measures will be retained, a varied weighting will apply.\n\nWe will recommence our use of a three year average Group cash ROE with ranges set with reference to a risk free rate plus margin and remove the use of a catastrophe collar. This measure will be weighted as 70%.\n\nThe remaining 30% weighting will be based on the performance of a relative TSR peer group which will reflect a global insurance peer group.\n\nThese changes maintain a strong link to measures management are able to influence and provide a stepped change approach to the regulatory requirements being introduced in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, refer to page 59.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWith culture and our people being two of the six strategic priorities, highlighted on page 9, I am confident that we will continue to drive forward a strong agenda for the benefit of our employees, customers and shareholders in 2022 and beyond.\n\nThe remuneration changes provide QBE with an opportunity to continue to adapt to the changing landscape along with the additional areas of focus for the year ahead.\n\nAs always, we look forward to shareholder feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn M Green\n\nDeputy Chair Chair, People & Remuneration Committee\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee is a member of the Risk & Capital Committee and vice versa. The attendance of other members of the Board at the People & Remuneration Committee meetings and close working relationship with the Risk & Capital Committee strengthen remuneration governance across QBE. The Group CRO attends the People & Remuneration Committee periodically to report on executive risk behaviours.\n\nExecutive KMP are required to adhere to a range of Group-wide policies to ensure risks are well managed, strong governance structures are in place and high ethical standards are maintained. The Board approves a comprehensive delegated authority for the Group CEO, which is an integral part of QBE's risk management process. The remuneration governance framework incorporates risk oversight principles so that executives cannot unduly influence a decision that could materially impact their own incentive outcome, and the performance-based components of remuneration established in QBE's incentive plans are designed to encourage behaviour that supports the Group's long-term financial soundness. Specifically, the QBE incentive plans:\n\n- \u00b7 are designed to deliver a target remuneration mix balanced between fixed/variable remuneration and short and long-term and cash and equity;\n- \u00b7 incorporate individual objectives through the STI that measure demonstrable proactive sound risk management, including the setting of a clear and consistent tone about the importance of managing risk throughout the organisation;\n- \u00b7 incorporate robust corporate standards for all employees supporting the QBE risk culture;\n- \u00b7 balance performance outcomes based on delivery against a range of financial and non-financial strategic metrics which are set in the context of business plans that have been appropriately stress-tested by the Group CRO;\n- \u00b7 enable the build-up of meaningful shareholding with deferred STI equity and LTI underpinned by a MSR for executive KMP (refer to page 66);\n- \u00b7 provide the Board with discretion to take other factors into account when determining the appropriate award outcome; and\n- \u00b7 allow for multiple risk adjustments, notably in year, malus provisions for unvested awards and clawback of cash payments and vested equity (refer to page 66).\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## 2. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n\nAs part of the year end process, an assessment of each senior executive's approach to risk management has been completed using input from the CRO. This process recognises positive and negative risk culture and risk management through upward or downward adjustment of performance ranges, incentive payouts and consequences that can include executives leaving the organisation.\n\nAcross the Group in 2021, over 100 assessments were carried out including for executive KMP and divisional executive teams. Based on the assessments in 2021, there were adjustments applied both upwards and downwards.\n\n## Malus provision\n\nThe malus provision gives the People & Remuneration Committee and the Board discretion to reduce the amount of an unvested award (including to zero) in certain circumstances during the retention period including in the case of:\n\n- \u00b7 misconduct leading to significant adverse outcomes;\n- \u00b7 a significant failure of financial or non-financial risk management;\n- \u00b7 a significant failure or breach of accountability, fitness and propriety, or compliance obligations;\n- \u00b7 a significant error or a significant misstatement of criteria on which the variable remuneration determination was based; and/or\n- \u00b7 significant adverse outcomes for customers, beneficiaries or counterparties.\n\nThis provision reflects QBE's obligations under APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 510 Governance to incorporate terms allowing for the adjustment of incentive awards to protect QBE's financial soundness and ability to respond to unforeseen significant issues. A review against the malus provision was completed as part of the year end process. There was no requirement to apply the provision in 2021.\n\n## Clawback provision\n\nThe clawback provision, introduced for the 2021 performance year, allows, to the extent permissible by applicable law, all variable remuneration (cash and deferred remuneration) to remain subject to clawback for a period of two years from the date of payment or vesting (as the case may be) of the relevant component of variable remuneration. The Board can determine whether to apply clawback to paid or vested variable remuneration and, if so, the appropriate value over which clawback will be applied. The circumstances in which the Board may apply clawback include those where it concludes in good faith that there is or has been:\n\n- \u00b7 misconduct leading to material adverse outcomes;\n- \u00b7 a material failure of financial or non-financial risk management;\n- \u00b7 a material failure or breach of accountability, fitness and propriety, or compliance obligations;\n- \u00b7 a material error or a material misstatement of criteria on which the variable remuneration determination was based; and/or\n- \u00b7 material adverse outcomes for customers, beneficiaries or counterparties.\n\nClawback may be applied to any variable remuneration that has been paid or vested (as the case may be) regardless of whether or not the employment or engagement of the relevant person is ongoing.\n\nA review against the clawback provision was completed as part of the year end process. There was no requirement to apply the provision in 2021.\n\n## Trading policy\n\nTrading in QBE ordinary shares is generally permitted outside of designated closed periods. QBE's trading policy states that non-executive directors and other designated employees must notify any intended share transaction to nominated people within the Group. The policy prohibits the hedging of QBE securities at all times. The purpose of this prohibition is to ensure that there is an alignment between the interests of executives and shareholders.\n\n- A copy of QBE's trading policy for dealing in securities is available from www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/ global-policies.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nThe MSR ensures executives build their shareholding to have significant exposure to QBE's share price. Under the MSR, a minimum of three times fixed remuneration for the Group CEO (one and a half times for other executive KMP) is to be maintained as long as the executive KMP remains at QBE. The value of shareholdings as a percentage of fixed remuneration at 31 December 2021 for each executive KMP is shown on pages 62 to 64. New executive KMP are required to build their shareholdings over a five-year period after becoming executive KMP.",

This is significantly less than the maximum of 10% over a 10-year period allowed under the plan rules.\n\n## Treatment of conditional rights on a change in control of QBE\n\nIn accordance with the rules of each of QBE's incentive plans, a change in control is defined as either a scheme of arrangement that has been approved by QBE's shareholders or the acquisition by a bidder of at least 50% of the issued and to be issued QBE shares under an unconditional takeover offer made in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nShould a change in organisational control occur, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine how unvested conditional rights should be treated, having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the performance period, the level of performance to date and the circumstances of the change of control.\n\n## Use of external advisors\n\nRemuneration consultants provide guidance on remuneration for executives, facilitate discussion, review remuneration and at-risk reward benchmarking within industry peer groups and provide guidance on current trends in executive remuneration practices. Any advice provided by remuneration consultants is used as a guide and is not a substitute for consideration of all the issues by each non-executive director on the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\nAustralian-based firm Ernst & Young (EY) currently acts as the independent remuneration advisor to the People & Remuneration Committee. The People & Remuneration Committee and the Board are satisfied that the advice provided by EY during 2021 was free from undue influence. The cost of advice and assistance provided by EY in 2021 was $61,000 (2020 $65,000).\n\nDuring 2021, management requested and utilised reports on market practice from various reputable sources. No recommendations in relation to the remuneration of KMP were provided as part of these engagements.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\nAt QBE, having the right talent across the Group enables us to create shareholder value, while prudently managing risk and maintaining strong corporate governance. To deliver our strategic ambitions, we must ensure that our executive remuneration framework reflects QBE's desire to attract and retain the best people.\n\nThis section sets out our approach for 2021. The graph below sets out the typical remuneration structure and delivery for the Group CEO for on-target performance, and how the remuneration vests over time:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive remuneration structure\n\nQBE's executive remuneration structure for 2021 remained broadly consistent with the prior year and comprised a mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration through STI and LTI plan arrangements.\n\nEach of these components is discussed in further detail in the following pages.\n\n## FIXED REMUNERATION /endash.cap KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nFixed remuneration comprises cash salary, superannuation/pension and packaged benefits, additional annual benefits and associated taxes. Additional annual benefits may include health insurance, life assurance, personal accident insurance, car allowances, expatriate benefits, occasional spouse travel to accompany the executive on business and applicable taxes.\n\nFixed remuneration is delivered in accordance with terms and conditions of employment.\n\n## Determining fixed remuneration levels\n\nFixed remuneration considers the diversity, complexity and expertise required of individual roles. Remuneration quantum is set in the context of QBE's broader reward strategy and internal relativities.\n\nTo assess the competitiveness of fixed remuneration, the People & Remuneration Committee considers market data and recognised published surveys.\n\nExecutive roles that are Australian-based are generally benchmarked to the ASX 30 and ASX 10-50 peer group of companies, with a specific focus on global companies and companies in the financial services industry. Overseas-based executives or roles that have a global reach are compared with a peer group consisting of global insurers. The peer group of companies used for remuneration benchmarking purposes is set out in the table below:\n\n| PEER GROUP                                                                                                                                                      | DESCRIPTION                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| The financial services company sub-peer group is determined based on the industry  classification listed on the ASX and includes commercial banks and insurers. | ASX peer group              |\n| Consists of large, global insurance companies aligned with the peer group used for the  LTI plan.                                                               | Global insurance peer group |",

        "page_content": "## STI /endash.cap KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nThe STI is a performance-based incentive delivered in the form of an annual cash payment and deferred award in the form of conditional rights to QBE shares. Performance is measured over a 12-month period.\n\n## Performance measures and rationale\n\nSTI outcomes are based on performance against Group cash ROE and COR, and divisional COR targets in the case of divisional executives, as well as individual strategic performance objectives reflecting QBE's strategic priorities as they apply to each executive's role. An explanation of the financial measures and their rationale is provided below:\n\n## Group cash return on equity\n\n## Combined operating ratio\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nA measure of how effectively we are managing shareholders' investment in QBE. For the STI, this measure will generally be measured on the same basis as that used to determine shareholder dividends. As a principle, losses due to unbudgeted amortisation/impairment of intangibles will, other than in exceptional circumstances, be included in cash ROE so that executives remain accountable for the management of intangible assets.\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nCash ROE is a measure of how effectively we manage shareholders' funds.\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nNet claims, commissions and expenses as a percentage of net earned premium. Consistent with how we report COR to the market, this is measured excluding the impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims. An equal blend of the COR outcomes for North America (1/3), International (1/3) and Australia Pacific (1/3) is used for the 2021 blended Group COR.\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nCOR is the most relevant measure of the underwriting performance of our insurance operations. The measure excludes the impact of risk-free rates because it is consistent with the way we report and with the basis on which the market assesses the underwriting performance of QBE.\n\nStrategic performance objectives : These objectives are linked to our longer-term strategic priorities. Executive KMP performance against the strategic performance objectives is evaluated annually by the Group CEO, and by the Chair in respect of the Group CEO, through formal business review assessments which include management of risk.\n\n- A summary of the achievements against the strategic performance objectives for 2021 is provided on page 61.\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS\n\nSTI outcomes may be adjusted by other items (such as material acquisitions or divestments) not included in the business plan and as deemed appropriate by the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Vesting schedule\n\nThe indicative STI vesting schedule is outlined below:\n\n|                               | THRESHOLD   | TARGET   | SUPERIOR   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|------------|\n| % of STI opportunity achieved | 30%         | 100%     | 150%       |\n\nThe STI rules provide suitable discretion to the People & Remuneration Committee to adjust any formulaic outcome to ensure STI awards appropriately reflect performance.\n\n## Instrument and deferral mechanics\n\nThe STI award is delivered as 67% in cash (50% in the case of the Group CEO and Interim Group CEO) and 33% is deferred as conditional rights to QBE shares (50% in the case of the Group CEO and Interim Group CEO).\n\nDeferred STI vests in two equal tranches - half on the first anniversary of the award and the remainder on the second anniversary of the award. Vesting is subject to service conditions during the deferral period. Malus and clawback also apply.\n\nTo calculate the number of conditional rights to be granted, the award value is divided by the volume weighted average price of QBE shares over the five trading days prior to the grant date. Notional dividends accrue during the deferral period.\n\n- STI awards for the 2021 performance year are detailed on pages 62 to 64.\n\n## Leaver provisions\n\nOn voluntary termination, dismissal or termination due to poor performance, all awards are forfeited.\n\n'Good leaver' provisions (e.g. retirement, redundancy, ill health, injury, mutually agreed separation (in some cases)) will apply such that:\n\n- \u00b7 STI opportunity is reduced to a pro-rata amount to reflect the proportion of the performance year in service; and\n- \u00b7 deferred awards remain in the plan subject to the original vesting conditions.\n\n## Malus and clawback provisions\n\nSTI is subject to malus and clawback, as applicable, enabling awards to be either forfeited, reduced or have clawback applied at the discretion of the People & Remuneration Committee and Board.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

Conditional rights are awarded at no cost to the executive KMP.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nVesting is subject to two equally weighted performance conditions measured over a three-year performance period:\n\n## Average cash return on equity\n\n## Relative total shareholder return\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nThe average of the three individual annual cash ROEs for the three individual years comprising the performance period (used for the 2021 grant due to volatility). A catastrophe adjustment may apply, which defines a ceiling and floor for catastrophe claims (see below) when determining LTI outcomes. Prior year grant details\n\nare provided in the relevant Annual Reports.\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nCash ROE is the primary financial measure of success for QBE and is most tangible for long-term decision making.\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS\n\nBecause the LTI performance period is measured over three years, extreme or benign catastrophe periods can have a material effect across multiple LTI awards. A levelling mechanism, introduced in 2019, effectively puts a ceiling and a floor on aggregate catastrophe claims when determining LTI outcomes. This levelling mechanism uses a range of +/- 1.5% of net earned premium either side of the budgeted catastrophe allowance for which LTI participants are exposed to catastrophe risk. For 2021, the range of $505 million to $865 million is applied. This means where actual aggregate catastrophe claims (after allowing for reinsurance recoveries) exceed $865 million, aggregate catastrophe claims are capped at this amount for calculating cash ROE. Conversely, in a very benign period, the lower limit of the collar ($505 million) provides a floor on aggregate catastrophe claims for calculating cash ROE. The cost of catastrophe claims for 2021 was $924 million, and this in excess of the range and consequently an after-tax adjustment of $49 million is applied and an adjusted cash ROE of 11% will be used for the 2021 performance period (2020 (14.2)%).\n\nAny other items (such as material acquisitions or divestments) not included in the business plan and deemed appropriate by the People & Remuneration Committee may be adjusted.\n\n## TSR peer group 1 - ASX 50 peer group (excludes any organisations domiciled overseas)\n\n| Afterpay Limited                                  | Dexus                             | Qantas Airways Limited      | Sydney Airport                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| APA Group                                         | Fortescue Metals Group Ltd        | QBE Insurance Group Limited | Tabcorp Holdings Limited                             |\n| Aristocrat Leisure Limited                        | Goodman Group                     | Ramsay Health Care Limited  | Telstra Corporation Limited                          |\n| ASX Limited                                       | GPT Group                         | REA Group Ltd               | TPG Telecom Limited                                  |\n| Australia and New Zealand Banking  Group Limited  | Insurance Australia Group Limited | Reece Limited               | Transurban Group                                     |\n| Australian Foundation Investment  Company Limited | Lendlease Group                   | Rio Tinto Limited           | Wesfarmers Limited                                   |\n| BHP Group Limited                                 | Macquarie Group Limited           | Santos Limited              | Westpac Banking Corporation                          |\n| BlueScope Steel Limited                           | Magellan Financial Group Limited  | Scentre Group               | WiseTech Global Limited                              |\n| Brambles Limited                                  | Mirvac Group                      | Seek Limited                | Woodside Petroleum Ltd                               |\n| Cochlear Limited                                  | National Australia Bank Limited   | Sonic Healthcare Limited    | Woolworths Group Limited                             |\n| Coles Group Limited                               | Newcrest Mining Limited           | South32 Limited             |                                                      |\n| Commonwealth Bank of Australia                    | Northern Star Resources Ltd       | Stockland                   | Coca-Cola Amatil Limited  (removed due to delisting) |\n| CSL Limited                                       | Origin Energy Limited             | Suncorp Group Limited       | Coca-Cola Amatil Limited  (removed due to delisting) |\n\n## TSR peer group 2 - Global insurance peer group\n\n| Allianz SE                   | Beazley PLC        | Insurance Australia Group Limited       | The Travelers Companies, Inc.   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| American International Group | Chubb Ltd          | QBE Insurance Group Limited             | Zurich Insurance Group AG       |\n| Aviva plc                    | CNA Financial Corp | Suncorp Group Limited                   | RSA Insurance Group plc         |\n| AXA SA                       | Hiscox Ltd         | Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. | (removed due to delisting)      |\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nTSR is the change in percentage value of an entity's share price plus the value of reinvested dividends and any capital returns measured over the three-year performance period.\n\nTSR of QBE is measured against two independent peer groups, shown below for 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 ASX 50 peer group (for 50% of the TSR component); and\n- \u00b7 a global insurance peer group (for 50% of the TSR component).\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nThe use of a relative TSR measure enables stronger pay for performance, aligning with shareholders.",

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\n## Changes to incentives for 2022\n\nIn considering our future incentive design, we have included feedback from multiple sources in an effort to evolve our incentive plans to better support our future strategy, target culture and align with the future requirements being introduced by Australian regulators.\n\nDialogue captured through the Culture Accelerator identified a number of areas that could be enhanced through incentive plan design. These included, being more future focused, being more enterprise focused, having a broader view of performance and having an increased focus on behaviours.\n\nBased on this the three key areas of change are firstly, the introduction of non-financial metrics with a material weighting through the STI. These would be assessed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Secondly, the use of a formalised 'how' rating which informs the overall rating of an executive KMP. This emphasises its importance and brings focus to the role that behaviours play in achieving STI outcomes across QBE. Thirdly, changes to simplify LTI for future grants include the removal of the relative TSR ASX 50 peer group and a higher weighting of the Group cash ROE component for 2022, removing the catastrophe adjustment mechanism and using risk free rate plus margin basis ensure that LTI outcomes are more easily understood, and therefore supported, by our internal stakeholders and shareholders.

The terms and conditions of employment of each executive KMP reflect market conditions at the time of their contract negotiation on appointment and thereafter. In addition, the typical treatment of incentives is also provided below.\n\n| CONTRACTUAL TERM                          | GROUP CEO  1                                                                | OTHER EXECUTIVE KMP                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Duration                                  | Permanent full-time employment contract until notice given by either party. | Permanent full-time employment contract until notice given by either party. |\n| Notice period   (by executive KMP or QBE) | 12 months: QBE may elect to make a payment  in lieu of notice.              | Six months: QBE may elect to make a payment  in lieu of notice.             |\n| Post-employment restraints                | 12 months non-compete and non-solicitation.                                 | Six to 12 months non-compete and non-solicitation.                          |\n\n- 1 The terms for the Interim Group CEO were not aligned with the Group CEO role due to the interim nature of the role.\n\n## Treatment of incentives\n\n## Involuntary termination\n\nOn termination with cause or for poor performance: All unvested incentives are forfeited.\n\nOn termination without cause: For STI in the year of termination, the executive remains eligible to be considered for an award on a pro-rata basis, with any award to be determined following the end of the performance year and subject to the standard deferral arrangements. Unvested deferred EIP and STI conditional rights remain in the plan subject to the original vesting dates and malus provisions. The unvested LTI conditional rights may be reduced to a pro-rata amount to reflect the proportion of the performance period in service and may continue to be held subject to the same performance and vesting conditions. Legacy LTI awards generally remain in the plan subject to the original performance and vesting conditions; however, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest these awards.\n\n## Voluntary termination\n\nAll unvested incentives are forfeited.",

Where an executive is a KMP for only part of the year, amounts shown are pro-rated. The Board exercised its discretion to deliver the 2020 STI in conditional rights.\n- 3 Includes the movement in annual leave and long service leave provisions during the relevant year.\n- 4 Includes conditional rights and legacy cash-settled awards. The fair value at grant date of conditional rights is determined using appropriate models including Monte Carlo simulations, depending on the vesting conditions. The fair value of each conditional right is recognised evenly over the service period ending at vesting date. Where an award will no longer vest, the related accounting charge for any non-market component is reversed in full and the reversal is included in the table above. For new executive KMP, this may include conditional rights granted as compensation for incentives forfeited on ceasing previous employment to join QBE in addition to a pro-rata grant of conditional rights for the 2021 LTI.

EIP outcomes were subject to the achievement of multiple performance measures over the one-year performance period including the Group's cash ROE and COR targets, individual performance ratings and, for divisional staff, divisional COR targets.\n\nThe EIP was replaced by the STI and LTI plans for executive KMP from 2019 but remains in existence for senior employees below the executive KMP level. The EIP awards made to Sam Harrison prior to his appointment as executive KMP include cash-settled share based payment awards which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the equivalent conditional rights described above. The benefit received at vesting is indexed to the movement in the A$ value of QBE's shares including dividends declared in the period between grant and vest dates.\n\n## Special long-term incentive awards\n\nThe LTI award made to Richard Pryce in early 2020 includes performance criteria aligned to specific deliverables as he transitioned to retirement. Other than the tailored performance criteria, the terms and conditions of the award are consistent with other executive KMP.\n\nThe LTI award made to Richard Pryce in October 2020, at the time of his appointment as Interim Group CEO, is subject to two performance conditions measured by the Board over the period he held this role. The performance measures were set with a focus on the delivery of a number of important priorities. These include a blend of individual and strategic measures to both reward for the stability provided as Interim Group CEO through 2021, setting QBE up for future success, and the creation of alignment with shareholder interests, structured as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 individual component (40%) - the Board will apply its discretion to determine outcomes against this component having considered achievement of agreed deliverables relating to executive team transition and development, building talent succession and depth, and effective engagement with regulators and shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 strategic component (60%) - this component will be measured against the delivery of a number of objectives including Customer@QBE, reinsurance strategy, IT modernisation strategy and cultural change.\n\nSubject to performance against the above, consideration of appropriate financial outcomes, risk behaviours during the vesting period and malus provisions, the conditional rights will vest in three tranches in Q1 2024 (33%), 2025 (33%) and 2026 (34%).",

        "page_content": "## 5. NON/hyphen.capEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION\n\nThe following section contains information on the approach to non-executive director remuneration, the fees, other benefits and shareholdings.\n\n## Remuneration philosophy\n\nNon-executive director remuneration reflects QBE's desire to attract, motivate and retain experienced independent directors and to ensure their active participation in the Group's affairs for the purpose of corporate governance, regulatory compliance and other matters. QBE aims to provide a level of remuneration for non-executive directors comparable with that of its peers, which include multi-national financial institutions. The Board reviews surveys published by independent remuneration consultants and other public information to ensure that fee levels are appropriate. The remuneration arrangements of non-executive directors are distinct and separate from those of the executive KMP.\n\n## Fee structure and components\n\nThe aggregate amount approved by shareholders at the 2017 AGM was A$4,000,000 per annum.\n\nThe total amount paid to non-executive directors in 2021 was A$3,398,414 (2020 A$3,237,700).\n\nUnder the current fee framework, non-executive directors receive a base fee expressed in Australian dollars. In addition, a non-executive director (other than the Chair) may receive further fees for chairing or membership of a board committee.\n\nNo changes were made to non-executive director remuneration during 2021.\n\nThe non-executive director fee structure in place since 2017 is shown in the table below:\n\n| ROLE      | CHAIR FEE   | DEPUTY CHAIR FEE   | MEMBER FEE   |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Board     | A$663,000   | A$229,000          | A$208,000    |\n| Committee | A$50,000    | -                  | A$27,000     |\n\n## Other benefits\n\nNon-executive directors do not receive any performance-based remuneration such as cash incentives or equity awards. Under QBE's Constitution, non-executive directors are entitled to be reimbursed for all travel and related expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of QBE. All non-executive directors are eligible to receive an annual cash travel allowance of A$42,750 (A$64,000 for the Chair), in addition to fees for the time involved in travelling to Board meetings and other Board commitments. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, the travel allowance was temporarily ceased in 2021 for non-executive directors.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nQBE pays superannuation to Australian-based non-executive directors in accordance with Australian superannuation guarantee (SG) legislation. Overseas-based non-executive directors receive the cash equivalent amount in addition to their fees. From 1 July 2021, the SG contribution increased by 0.5% to 10.0%. This change is reflected in table 5.2.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, Australian-based directors may elect to opt out of superannuation contributions as long as they are still receiving contributions from at least one employer. In such cases, a superannuation allowance will be paid in lieu of actual contributions.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2014, a non-executive director MSR was introduced for the Board. Under this requirement, non-executive directors have five years to build a minimum shareholding equal to 100% of annual base fees.\n\nTo assist current and new non-executive directors in meeting the requirement, a Director Share Acquisition Plan (DSAP) was established with effect from 1 June 2014. The DSAP allows non-executive directors to sacrifice a portion of their director pre-tax fees to acquire QBE shares.\n\nWhere the MSR has not been met, non-executive directors are required to sacrifice a mandatory minimum amount of 20% of pre-tax fees into the DSAP until the MSR is achieved. Shares acquired in this way are not subject to performance targets, as they are acquired in place of cash payments. Directors' shareholdings are shown overleaf. All non-executive directors have met the MSR as at 31 December 2021, or are within the five-year period to achieve the MSR.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.1 About QBE\n\n## About QBE Insurance Group\n\nQBE is one of the world's largest insurance and reinsurance companies, with operations in all the major insurance markets. Formed in Australia in 1886, QBE employs more than 11,000 people and carries on insurance activities in 27 countries, with operations in Australia, Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific. QBE's captive reinsurer, Equator Re, provides reinsurance protection to our divisions in conjunction with the Group's external reinsurance programs.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is a for-profit entity.\n\n## About insurance\n\nIn simple terms, insurance and reinsurance companies help their customers (consumers, businesses and other insurance companies) to manage risk. More broadly put, an insurance company creates value by pooling and redistributing risk. This is done by collecting premium from those that it insures (i.e. policyholders), and then paying the claims of the few that call upon their insurance protection. A company may also choose to reduce some of its own accumulated risk through the use of outward reinsurance, which is insurance for insurance companies. As not all policyholders will actually experience a claims event, the effective pooling and redistribution of risk lowers the total cost of risk management, thereby making insurance protection more cost effective for all.\n\nThe operating model of insurance companies relies on profits being generated by:\n\n- \u00b7 appropriately pricing risk and charging adequate premium to cover the expected payouts that will be incurred over the life of the insurance policy (both claims and operating expenses); and\n- \u00b7 earning a return on the collected premium and funds withheld to pay future claims through the adoption of an appropriate investment strategy.\n\nInsurance therefore serves a critical function of providing customers with the confidence to achieve their business and personal goals through cost-effective risk management. This is achieved within a highly regulated environment, designed to ensure that insurance companies maintain adequate capital to protect the interests of policyholders.\n\nThe diagram below presents a simplified overview of the key components of this Financial Report:\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 About this report\n\nThis Financial Report includes the consolidated financial statements of QBE Insurance Group Limited (the ultimate parent entity or the Company) and its controlled entities (QBE or the Group).\n\nThe Financial Report includes the four primary statements, namely the statement of comprehensive income (which comprises profit or loss and other comprehensive income or loss), balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows as well as associated notes as required by Australian Accounting Standards. Disclosures have been grouped into the following categories in order to assist users in their understanding of the financial statements:\n\n- 1. Overview contains information that impacts the Financial Report as a whole as well as segment reporting disclosures.\n- 2. Underwriting activities brings together results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's insurance activities.\n- 3. Investment activities includes results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's investments.\n- 4. Risk management provides commentary on the Group's exposure to various financial and capital risks, explaining the potential impact on the results and balance sheet and how the Group manages these risks.\n- 5. Capital structure provides information about the debt and equity components of the Group's capital.\n- 6. Tax includes disclosures relating to the Group's tax expense and balances.\n- 7. Group structure provides a summary of the Group's controlled entities and includes disclosures in relation to transactions impacting the Group structure.\n- 8. Other includes additional disclosures required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nWhere applicable within each note, disclosures are further analysed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Overview provides some context to assist users in understanding the disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures (both numbers and commentary) provide analysis of balances as required by Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 How we account for the numbers summarises the accounting policies relevant to an understanding of the numbers.\n- \u00b7 Critical accounting judgements and estimates explains the key estimates and judgements applied by QBE in determining the numbers.\n\nThe notes include information which the directors believe is required to understand the financial statements and is material and relevant to the operations, balance sheet and results of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant if:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount in question is significant because of its size or nature;\n- \u00b7 it is important to assist in understanding the results of the Group;\n- \u00b7 it helps to explain the impact of significant changes in the Group's business - for example, significant acquisitions or disposals; or\n- \u00b7 it relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance.\n\n## 1.2.1 Basis of preparation\n\nThis Financial Report is a general purpose financial report which:\n\n- \u00b7 has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 ;\n- \u00b7 complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Interpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC);\n- \u00b7 has been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by certain exceptions, the most significant of which are the measurement of investments and derivatives at fair value and the measurement of the net outstanding claims liability at present value;\n- \u00b7 is presented in US dollars; and\n- \u00b7 is presented with values rounded to the nearest million dollars or, in certain cases, to the nearest thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 .\n\nNew and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are now effective are detailed in note 8.1.1.\n\nThe Group has not adopted any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective as listed in note 8.1.2.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by the Company as at 31 December 2021 and the results for the financial year then ended. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all transactions between controlled entities are eliminated in full. Where control of an entity commences or ceases during a financial year, the results are included for that part of the year during which control existed. A list of entities controlled by the Company at the balance date is contained in note 7.2.\n\nLloyd's syndicates are accounted for on a proportional basis. The nature of Lloyd's syndicates is such that, even when one party provides the majority of capital, the syndicate as a whole is not controlled for accounting purposes.\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been restated to conform to the current year's disclosures.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021\n\n## 1. OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.2.2 Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts. The diversity and complexity of the Group are evidenced by its international operations and the broad product range as shown in the class of business analysis in note 4.2.\n\nIn view of its geographic and product diversity, the Group has developed a centralised risk management and policy framework designed to ensure consistency of approach across a number of operational activities, subject to the specific requirements of local markets, legislation and regulation. Such operational activities include underwriting, claims management, actuarial assessment of the outstanding claims liability and investment management.\n\nGiven the centralised approach to many activities and the diversity of products and geographies, sensitivity analyses in respect of critical accounting estimates and judgements are presented at the consolidated Group level in order to provide information and analysis which is meaningful, relevant, reliable and comparable year-on-year. Sensitivity disclosure at business segment or product level would not provide a meaningful overview given the complex interrelationships between the variables underpinning the Group's operations.\n\nThe key areas in which critical estimates and judgements are applied are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 net outstanding claims liability (note 2.3);\n- \u00b7 liability adequacy test (note 2.5.1);\n- \u00b7 recoverability of deferred tax assets (note 6.2.1); and\n- \u00b7 impairment testing of intangible assets (note 7.1.1).\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 on these areas are discussed in note 1.2.3 and in individual notes where appropriate.\n\n## 1.2.3 COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation in March 2020. The virus itself, as well as measures to slow its spread, have had a profound impact on the global economy. QBE has considered a broad range of factors in assessing the impact of the resulting uncertainty on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWhile the areas of critical accounting judgements and estimates did not change, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in the application of further judgement within those identified areas. Given the continued uncertainty related to the potential impact of COVID-19, there may be changes in market conditions in the future and the impact of these changes will be accounted for in future reporting periods as they arise and/or can be reasonably predicted.\n\nAreas which were most impacted by COVID-19 at the balance date were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Net discounted central estimate (note 2.3): QBE's result and balance sheet were materially impacted by the estimated cost of COVID-19-related claims in 2020. The projected net ultimate cost of COVID-19-related claims is based on detailed reviews of the Group's emerging claims experience and exposure, scenario analysis under a variety of macroeconomic and legislative outcomes, and consideration of the Group's reinsurance protections. There has been no material change to the projected ultimate cost of COVID-19-related claims, noting a release of claims incurred in 2020 has been offset by claims incurred in 2021. Although the overall cost of COVID-19-related claims is relatively unchanged, the uncertainty in relation to ultimate outcomes is, in our view, somewhat reduced compared with the prior reporting period. The release relating to COVID-19-related claims incurred in 2020, which is supported by emerging claims experience, is consistent with this view.\n\nThe potential impact of ongoing litigation relating to the Group's property business interruption exposure (refer to note 8.2), including the second industry test case in Australia concerning the interpretation and application of exclusion clauses in relation to COVID-19, has been considered in the determination of the net discounted central estimate and risk margin (see below). While the initial judgement from the second Australian business interruption test case was favourable to insurers, it is currently subject to appeal. The ultimate cost of claims therefore remains uncertain pending the outcome of the appeal.\n\nQBE will continue to monitor emerging claims experience, legislative outcomes and wider market developments to ensure that the net discounted central estimate is reflective of the Group's best estimate of expected future claims.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk margin (note 2.3.3): The Group aims to maintain a probability of adequacy in the range of 87.5% to 92.5% reflecting the level of uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate. In response to the heightened level of uncertainty related to the potential impact of COVID-19 on claims outcomes, QBE increased the risk margin at 31 December 2020 to achieve a probability of adequacy of 92.5%, at the upper end of the Group's target range. During the current period, the Group released $140 million of this risk margin reflecting the reduced uncertainty related to COVID-19, particularly with respect to business interruption claims across all regions where we have exposure, trade credit and LMI claims. The probability of adequacy at 31 December 2021 is 91.7%.\n- \u00b7 Liability adequacy test (note 2.5.1): This assessment is informed by the Group's expectation of future net claims including a risk margin and is therefore subject to uncertainties similar to those discussed above. Future claims assumptions used in the liability adequacy test have been selected whilst giving consideration to, amongst other factors, the potential for ongoing impact from COVID-19, albeit that the future risk associated with COVID-19 is somewhat reduced compared with the prior reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Goodwill impairment testing (note 7.1.1): A detailed impairment test has been completed in respect of the carrying value of QBE's cash-generating units, which included consideration of the impact of COVID-19 consistent with the process undertaken at 31 December 2020. The explicit risk premium adjustment which was included in the pre-tax discount rate at 31 December 2020 in response to COVID-19 uncertainty has been removed with the continuing, albeit reduced, uncertainty in relation to COVID-19 now implicitly reflected in the equity beta used to calculate the cost of equity. The impact of this change on the recoverable value of the cash-generating units was not material.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 North American tax group deferred tax asset recoverability (note 6.2.1): QBE's reassessment of the recoverability of this asset included consideration of the potential impacts of COVID-19. The recoverability assessment has been updated, consistent with the impairment testing completed for the North American cash-generating unit and other entities where relevant.\n\nThe Group's COVID-19 financial impact assessment was not limited to the areas identified above. All material components of the balance sheet were considered in detail, as was the effectiveness of QBE's risk management framework in responding to both financial and non-financial risks, with no material issues identified.\n\n## 1.2.4 Foreign currency\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions included in the financial statements of controlled entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currencies at the spot rates of exchange applicable at the dates of the transactions. At the balance date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in profit or loss.\n\n## Translation of foreign operations\n\nThe results and balance sheets of all foreign operations that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency of US dollars are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 income, expenses and other current period movements in comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange; and\n- \u00b7 balance sheet items are translated at the closing balance date rates of exchange.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign operations are taken to shareholders' equity and recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold in whole or part and capital is repatriated, exchange differences on translation from the entity's functional currency to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars are reclassified out of other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Hedging of foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group manages its foreign exchange exposures as part of its foreign currency risk management processes, further information on which is provided in note 4.4.\n\nQBE uses borrowings to mitigate currency risk on translation of net investments in foreign operations to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars. QBE may elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nQBE also uses derivatives to mitigate risk associated with foreign currency transactions and balances.\n\nThe Group designates hedge relationships which meet the specified criteria in AASB 9 Financial Instruments as either cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Further information on the accounting for derivatives and for designated hedge relationships is provided in note 5.6.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:\n\n|        | 2021           | 2021          | 2020           | 2020          |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n|        | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET |\n| A$/US$ | 0.751          | 0.727         | 0.688          | 0.771         |\n| \u00a3/US$  | 1.375          | 1.353         | 1.283          | 1.368         |\n| \u20ac/US$  | 1.182          | 1.138         | 1.140          | 1.222         |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section provides analysis and commentary on the Group's underwriting activities. Underwriting, in simple terms, is the agreement by the insurer to assume insurance risk in return for a premium paid by the insured. The underwriter assesses the quality of the risk and prices it accordingly.\n\n## 2.1 Revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nRevenue mainly comprises premiums charged for providing insurance coverage. Premiums are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 direct, being those paid by the policyholder to the insurer;\n- \u00b7 facultative, being reinsurance of an individual (usually significant) risk by a ceding insurer or reinsurer; or\n- \u00b7 inward reinsurance, being coverage provided to an insurer or reinsurer in relation to a specified grouping of policies or risks.\n\nOther sources of revenue include amounts recovered from reinsurers under the terms of reinsurance contracts, commission income from reinsurers and salvage or third-party recoveries.\n\n|                                          | NOTE   | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gross earned premium revenue             |        |             |             |\n| Direct and facultative                   |        | 15,493      | 12,634      |\n| Inward reinsurance                       |        | 1,542       | 1,374       |\n|                                          |        | 17,035      | 14,008      |\n| Other revenue                            |        |             |             |\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries revenue | 2.2    | 3,093       | 3,366       |\n| Reinsurance commission revenue           |        | 634         | 440         |\n|                                          |        | 20,762      | 17,814      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\n## Premium revenue\n\nPremium written comprises amounts charged to policyholders, excluding taxes collected on behalf of third parties. Premium is recognised as revenue in profit or loss based on the incidence of the pattern of risk associated with the insurance policy. The earned portion of premium on unclosed business, being business that is written at the balance date but for which detailed policy information is not yet booked, is also included in premium revenue.\n\n## Reinsurance and other recoveries\n\nReinsurance and other recoveries on paid claims, reported claims not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims incurred but not enough reported (IBNER) are recognised as revenue. Recoveries are measured as the present value of the expected future receipts.",

When an insurance company incurs a claim as a result of an insured loss, it may be able to recover some of that claim from reinsurance. An insurer may also be entitled to non-reinsurance recoveries under the insurance contract such as salvage, subrogation and sharing arrangements with other insurers; less\n- \u00b7 an amount to reflect the discount to present value using risk-free rates of return: The net central estimate is discounted to present value recognising that the claim and/or recovery may not be settled for some time.

The central estimate is determined by the Group Chief Actuary, supported by a team of actuaries in each of the Group's divisions. The valuation process is performed quarterly and, on at least a semi-annual basis, includes extensive consultation with claims and underwriting staff as well as senior management. The central estimate of outstanding claims is also subject to annual comprehensive independent actuarial review. The risk management procedures related to the actuarial function are explained in note 4.2.",

Some of the uncertainties impacting these assumptions are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in patterns of claims incidence, reporting and payment;\n- \u00b7 volatility in the estimation of future costs for long-tail insurance classes due to the longer period of time that can elapse before a claim is paid in full;\n- \u00b7 existence of complex underlying exposures;\n- \u00b7 incidence of catastrophic events close to the balance date;\n- \u00b7 changes in the legal environment, including the interpretation of liability laws and the quantum of damages;\n- \u00b7 changing social, political and economic trends, for example price and wage inflation; and\n- \u00b7 impacts of COVID-19 as described in note 1.2.3.\n\nThe estimation of IBNR and IBNER is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims that have been reported to the Group but are not yet paid, for which more information about the claims is generally available. The notification and settlement of claims relating to liability and other long-tail classes of business may not happen for many years after the event giving rise to the claim. As a consequence, liability and other long-tail classes typically display greater variability between initial estimates and final settlement due to delays in reporting claims and uncertainty in respect of court awards and future claims inflation. Claims in respect of property and other short-tail classes are typically reported and settled soon after the claim event, giving rise to more certainty.\n\nCentral estimates for each class of business are determined using a variety of estimation techniques, generally based on an analysis of historical experience and with reference to external benchmarks where relevant. The gross central estimate is discounted to present value using appropriate risk-free rates.\n\nCentral estimates are calculated gross of any reinsurance and other recoveries. A separate estimate is made of the amounts recoverable based on the gross central estimate (refer to note 2.3.2).\n\n## 2.3.2 Reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims\n\n|                                                                       | NOTE   | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims - undiscounted |        | 7,014       | 6,623       |\n| Discount to present value                                             |        | (257)       | (96)        |\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims                | 2.3    | 6,757       | 6,527       |\n| Receivable within 12 months                                           |        | 2,758       | 2,715       |\n| Receivable in greater than 12 months                                  |        | 3,999       | 3,812       |\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims                | 2.3    | 6,757       | 6,527       |\n\n- 1  Net of a provision for impairment of $32 million (2020 $21 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe recoverability of amounts due from reinsurers is assessed at each balance date to ensure that the balances properly reflect the amounts ultimately expected to be received, taking into account counterparty credit risk and the contractual terms of the reinsurance contract. Counterparty credit risk in relation to reinsurance assets is considered in note 4.3. Recoveries are discounted to present value using appropriate risk-free rates.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n## 2.3.3 Risk margin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nA risk margin is determined by the Board to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate.\n\nThe risk margin and the net discounted central estimate are key inputs in the determination of the probability of adequacy, which is a statistical measure of the relative adequacy of the outstanding claims liability to ultimately be able to pay claims. For example, a 90% probability of adequacy indicates that the outstanding claims liability is expected to be adequate nine years in 10.\n\n|                                                                    |      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Risk margin                                                        | US$M | 1,418  | 1,537  |\n| Risk margin as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate | %    | 8.8    | 9.7    |\n| Probability of adequacy                                            | %    | 91.7   | 92.5   |\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange which reduced the risk margin by $37 million (2020 $57 million increase), the net movement in profit or loss was a release of $82 million (2020 $344 million charge). The resulting probability of adequacy was 91.7% (2020 92.5%). Net profit after tax would have reduced by $40 million, at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%, if the probability of adequacy was maintained at 92.5%.\n\nThe reduction in risk margin mainly reflects reduced uncertainty related to the impact of COVID-19 partly offset by additional risk margin in response to business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nAASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts requires an entity to adopt an appropriate risk margin. The resulting probability of adequacy is not of itself an accounting policy as defined by AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .\n\nQBE reviews a number of factors when determining the appropriate risk margin, including any changes in the level of uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate, the resulting probability of adequacy and the risk margin as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate. The Group aims to maintain a probability of adequacy in the range of 87.5% to 92.5%.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe risk margin is determined by the Board and is held to mitigate the potential for uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate. The determination of the appropriate level of risk margin takes into account similar factors to those used to determine the central estimate, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 mix of business, in particular the mix of short-tail and long-tail business and the overall weighted average term to settlement; and\n- \u00b7 the level of uncertainty in the central estimate due to estimation error, data quality, variability of key inflation assumptions and possible economic and legislative changes.\n\nThe variability by class of business is measured using techniques that determine a range of possible outcomes of ultimate payments and assign a likelihood to outcomes at different levels. These techniques generally use standard statistical distributions, and the measure of variability is referred to as the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe appropriate risk margin for two or more classes of business or for two or more geographic locations combined is likely to be less than the sum of the risk margins for the individual classes, reflecting the benefit of diversification in general insurance, but is not determined by reference to a fixed probability of adequacy. The statistical measure used to determine diversification is called the correlation; the higher the correlation between two classes of business, the more likely it is that a negative outcome in one class will correspond to a negative outcome in the other class. For example, higher correlation exists between classes of business affected by court cases involving bodily injury claims such as motor third-party liability, workers' compensation and public liability, particularly in the same jurisdiction.\n\nThe probability of adequacy for the Group is determined by analysing the variability of each class of business and the correlation between classes of business and divisions. Correlations are determined for aggregations of classes of business, where appropriate, at the divisional level. The correlations adopted by the Group are generally derived from industry analysis, the Group's historical experience and the judgement of experienced and qualified actuaries.",

The table below summarises the expected maturity profile of the Group's net discounted central estimate for each operating segment.\n\n| 2021              | LESS THAN  1 YEAR  US$M   | 13 TO 24  MONTHS  US$M   | 25 TO 36  MONTHS  US$M   | 37 TO 48  MONTHS  US$M   | 49 TO 60  MONTHS  US$M   | OVER 5  YEARS  US$M   | TOTAL  US$M   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| North America     | 1,578                     | 608                      | 413                      | 274                      | 193                      | 647                   | 3,713         |\n| International     | 2,404                     | 1,631                    | 1,143                    | 842                      | 632                      | 2,120                 | 8,772         |\n| Australia Pacific | 1,599                     | 713                      | 465                      | 300                      | 190                      | 355                   | 3,622         |\n|                   | 5,581                     | 2,952                    | 2,021                    | 1,416                    | 1,015                    | 3,122                 | 16,107        |\n| 2020              | LESS THAN  1 YEAR  US$M   | 13 TO 24  MONTHS  US$M   | 25 TO 36  MONTHS  US$M   | 37 TO 48  MONTHS  US$M   | 49 TO 60  MONTHS  US$M   | OVER 5  YEARS  US$M   | TOTAL  US$M   |\n| North America     | 1,241                     | 571                      | 417                      | 289                      | 195                      | 684                   | 3,397         |\n| International     | 2,581                     | 1,192                    | 1,201                    | 897                      | 665                      | 1,992                 | 8,528         |\n| Australia Pacific | 1,240                     | 831                      | 596                      | 454                      | 268                      | 483                   | 3,872         |\n|                   | 5,062                     | 2,594                    | 2,214                    | 1,640                    | 1,128                    | 3,159                 | 15,797        |\n\n## 2.3.7 Impact of changes in key variables on the net outstanding claims liability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThe impact of changes in key variables used in the calculation of the outstanding claims liability is summarised in the table below. Each change has been calculated in isolation from the other changes and shows the after-tax impact on profit or loss assuming that there is no change to any of the other variables. In practice, this is considered unlikely to occur as, for example, an increase in interest rates is normally associated with an increase in the rate of inflation. Over the medium to longer term, the impact of a change in discount rates is expected to be largely offset by the impact of a change in the rate of inflation.\n\nThe sensitivities below assume that all changes directly impact profit after tax. In practice, if the central estimate was to increase, it is possible that part of the increase may result in an offsetting change in the level of risk margin required rather than in a change to profit or loss after tax, depending on the nature of the change in the central estimate and risk outlook. Likewise, if the coefficient of variation were to increase, it is possible that the probability of adequacy would reduce from its current level rather than result in a change to net profit or loss after income tax.\n\n|                                     |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                     | SENSITIVITY % | 2021 US$M         | 2020 US$M         |\n| Net discounted central estimate     | +5            | (564)             | (553)             |\n|                                     | -5            | 564               | 553               |\n| Risk margin                         | +5            | (50)              | (54)              |\n|                                     | -5            | 50                | 54                |\n| Inflation rate                      | +0.5          | (206)             | (194)             |\n|                                     | -0.5          | 193               | 185               |\n| Discount rate                       | +0.5          | 193               | 185               |\n|                                     | -0.5          | (206)             | (194)             |\n| Coefficient of variation            | +1            | (163)             | (166)             |\n|                                     | -1            | 162               | 166               |\n| Probability of adequacy             | +1            | (53)              | (60)              |\n|                                     | -1            | 48                | 54                |\n| Weighted average term to settlement | +10           | 38                | 11                |\n|                                     | -10           | (38)              | (11)              |\n\n- 1  Net of tax at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%.",

This table therefore illustrates the variability and inherent uncertainty in estimating the central estimate each year. The ultimate claims cost for any particular accident year is not known until all claims payments have been made which, for some long-tail classes of business, could be many years into the future. The estimate of net ultimate claims payments at the end of each subsequent accident year demonstrates how the original estimate has been revised over time (b).\n\nCumulative net claims payments (d) are deducted from the estimate of net ultimate claims payments in each accident year (c) at the current balance date, resulting in the undiscounted central estimate at a fixed rate of exchange (e). This is revalued to the balance date rate of exchange (f) to report the net undiscounted central estimate (g), which is reconciled to the discounted net outstanding claims liability (h). The treatment of foreign exchange in the claims development table is explained on the following page.\n\nThe net increase (decrease) in estimated net ultimate claims payments (i) reflects the estimated ultimate net claims payments at the end of the current financial year (c) less the equivalent at the end of the previous financial year (b). This is further summarised in note 2.4.1.\n\nThe claims development table is presented net of reinsurance. With insurance operations in 27 countries, hundreds of products, various reinsurance arrangements and with the Group's risk tolerance managed on a consolidated basis, it is considered neither meaningful nor practicable to provide this information other than on a consolidated Group basis.\n\n2011 &\n\n|                                |

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe estimate of net ultimate claims payments attributable to business acquired is generally included in the claims development table in the accident year in which the acquisition was made. The exception is increased participation in Lloyd's syndicates where the estimate of net ultimate claims payments is allocated to the original accident year(s) in which the underlying claim was incurred.\n\nThe Group writes business in many currencies. The translation of estimated net ultimate claims payments denominated in foreign currencies gives rise to foreign exchange movements which have no direct bearing on the development of the underlying claims. To eliminate this distortion, estimated net ultimate claims payments have been translated to the functional currencies of our controlled entities at constant rates of exchange. All estimates of ultimate claims payments for the 10 most recent accident years reported in functional currencies other than US dollars have been translated to US dollars using 2021 average rates of exchange.\n\n## 2.4.1 Reconciliation of claims development table to profit or loss\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThe table below reconciles the net increase or decrease in estimated net ultimate claims payments in the current financial year from the claims development table (item (i) in note 2.4) to the analysis of current and prior accident year net central estimate development recognised in profit or loss (refer to note 2.4.2).\n\n|                                                                       | 2021                         | 2021                        | 2021       | 2020                         | 2020                        | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                                                                       | CURRENT  ACCIDENT  YEAR US$M | PRIOR  ACCIDENT  YEARS US$M | TOTAL US$M | CURRENT  ACCIDENT  YEAR US$M | PRIOR  ACCIDENT  YEARS US$M | TOTAL US$M |\n| Movement in estimated net ultimate claims payments  (note 2.4) 1, 2,3 | 8,463                        | (142)                       | 8,321      | 7,469                        | 363                         | 7,832      |\n| Movement in claims settlement costs                                   | 433                          | 1                           | 434        | 413                          | (1)                         | 412        |\n| Movement in discount                                                  | (85)                         | (232)                       | (317)      | (39)                         | 387                         | 348        |\n| Other movements                                                       | 2                            | 13                          | 15         | 5                            | (7)                         | (2)        |\n| Movement in net discounted central estimate (note 2.4.2)              | 8,813                        | (360)                       | 8,453      | 7,848                        | 742                         | 8,590      |\n\n- 2  2021 prior accident year claims includes a benefit of $324 million from the reinsurance of Australian CTP liabilities.

The unearned premium liability is that portion of gross written premium that QBE has not yet earned in profit or loss as it represents insurance coverage to be provided by QBE after the balance date.\n\n## Deferred insurance costs\n\nPremium ceded to reinsurers by QBE in exchange for reinsurance protection is expensed in profit or loss in accordance with the reinsurance contract's expected pattern of incidence of risk. The deferred reinsurance premium asset is that portion of the reinsurance premium that QBE has not yet expensed in profit or loss as it represents reinsurance coverage to be received by QBE after the balance date.\n\nAcquisition costs are the costs associated with obtaining and recording insurance business. Acquisition costs are similarly capitalised and amortised, consistent with the earning of the related premium for that business. Commissions are a type of acquisition cost and are disclosed separately.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

At the balance date, deferred acquisition costs represent the capitalised acquisition costs that relate to unearned premium and are carried forward to a subsequent accounting period in recognition of their future benefit. The carrying value of deferred acquisition costs is subject to impairment testing in the form of the liability adequacy test (refer to note 2.5.1). Deferred net commission is a type of deferred acquisition cost and is disclosed separately.\n\n## 2.5.1 Liability adequacy test\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nAt each balance date, the Group is required to assess net unearned premium to determine whether the amount provided is sufficient to pay future claims net of reinsurance recoveries attributable to the net unearned premium.\n\nIf the present value of expected future net claims including a risk margin exceeds the net unearned premium, adjusted for deferred reinsurance premium relating to future business not yet written, the net unearned premium is deemed deficient. This deficiency is immediately recognised in profit or loss. In recognising the deficiency, an insurer must first write down related intangible assets and then deferred acquisition costs before recognising an unexpired risk liability.\n\n## Expected present value of future cash /flows for future claims including risk margin\n\n|                                                                                     | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Undiscounted net central estimate                                                   | 5,282       | 4,676       |\n| Discount to present value                                                           | (98)        | (23)        |\n|                                                                                     | 5,184       | 4,653       |\n| Risk margin at the 75th percentile of insurance liabilities                         | 197         | 181         |\n| Expected present value of future cash flows for future claims including risk margin | 5,381       | 4,834       |\n\nThe risk margin at the 75th percentile of insurance liabilities as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate is 3.8% (2020 3.9%).\n\nThe application of the liability adequacy test at 31 December 2021 did not identify a deficiency (2020 nil).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nAt each balance date, the adequacy of net unearned premium is assessed on a net of reinsurance basis against the present value of the expected future claims cash flows in respect of the relevant insurance contracts, plus an additional risk margin to reflect the inherent uncertainty of the central estimate. The assessment is carried out at the operating segment level other than Europe, Asia and the Group's captive reinsurer, Equator Re, which are assessed separately, each being a portfolio of contracts subject to broadly similar risks and which are managed together as a single portfolio.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nIn assessing the adequacy of net unearned premium, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts requires the inclusion of a risk margin but does not prescribe a minimum level of margin. While there is established practice in the calculation of the probability of adequacy of the outstanding claims liability, no such guidance exists in respect of the level of risk margin to be used in determining the adequacy of net unearned premium.\n\nThe liability adequacy test assumes a 75% probability of adequacy. The risk margin applied in the liability adequacy test is determined on a consistent basis with the methodology described in note 2.3.3 and also reflects the benefit of diversification. The 75% basis is a recognised industry benchmark in Australia, being the minimum probability of adequacy required for Australian licensed insurers by APRA.\n\n## 2.6 Trade and other receivables\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nTrade and other receivables are principally amounts owed to QBE by policyholders or reinsurance counterparties. Unclosed premium receivables are estimated amounts due to QBE in relation to business for which the Group is on risk but which have not yet been processed into financial systems.\n\n|                                      | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Trade debtors                        |             |             |\n| Premium receivable 1                 | 3,462       | 2,990       |\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries 2   | 2,118       | 1,452       |\n| Unclosed premium                     | 774         | 729         |\n| Other trade debtors                  | 195         | 224         |\n|                                      | 6,549       | 5,395       |\n| Other receivables                    | 560         | 365         |\n| Trade and other receivables          | 7,109       | 5,760       |\n| Receivable within 12 months          | 6,628       | 5,471       |\n| Receivable in greater than 12 months | 481         | 289         |\n| Trade and other receivables          | 7,109       | 5,760       |\n\n- 1  Net of a provision for impairment of $81 million (2020 $88 million).\n- 2  Net of a provision for impairment of $17 million (2020 $14 million).\n\nDue to the predominantly short-term nature of these receivables, the carrying value is assumed to approximate the fair value.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivables. No receivables are pledged by the Group as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities. Information on the ageing and credit rating of these balances is included in note 4.3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nReceivables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost less any impairment.\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's receivables arise from general insurance contracts. These include premium receivable, reinsurance and other recoveries, and unclosed premium. For these receivables, a provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. The remainder of the Group's receivables are assessed for impairment based on expected credit losses, the impacts of which are not material. Any increase or decrease in the provision for impairment is recognised in profit or loss within underwriting expenses.",

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nPremiums collected from policyholders are invested to meet the Group's cash flow needs to pay claims and other expenses, as well as generating a return that contributes to the Group's profitability. A sound investment strategy is therefore integral to the success of the Group's operations.\n\nThe Group invests across a diversified range of instruments to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. Decisions on where to invest are dependent on expected returns, cash flow requirements of the Group, liquidity of the instrument, credit quality of the instrument and the overall risk appetite of the Group.

The fair value hierarchy and the Group's approach to measuring the fair value of each category of investment instrument are disclosed in note 3.2.1.\n\nAll purchases and sales of investments that require delivery of the asset within the time frame established by regulation or market convention are recognised at trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to buy or sell the asset. Investments are de-recognised when the right to receive future cash flows from the asset has expired or has been transferred along with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n1\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Term deposits are valued at par; other short-term money (bank bills, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other short-term instruments) is priced using interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Government bonds and corporate bonds\n\nGovernment bonds and corporate bonds are valued based on quoted prices sourced from external data providers. The fair value categorisation of these assets is based on the observability of the inputs. At 31 December 2021, $332 million of government bonds were reclassified from level 2 to level 1 following a reassessment of the observability of inputs used in the valuation of those assets.\n\n## Infrastructure debt\n\nInfrastructure debt is priced by external data providers where quoted prices are available or by the external fund manager who may use a combination of observable market prices or comparable prices where available and other valuation techniques. When valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n## Developed market equity\n\nListed equities traded in active markets are valued by reference to quoted bid prices. Unlisted equities are priced using QBE's share of the net assets of the entity.\n\n## Unlisted property trusts and infrastructure assets\n\nThese assets are valued using current unit prices as advised by the responsible entity, trustee or equivalent of the investment management scheme. As the valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.",

Fair value is based on the net asset value of the vehicle, and the responsibility for the valuation of the underlying securities lies with the external fund manager. In most cases, an independent administrator will be utilised by the external fund manager for pricing and valuation. When the most up to date information is not available at the balance date, management may consider a combination of other valuation techniques in the determination of fair value. During the period, these assets were disposed of, or reclassified to assets held for sale as described in note 3.2.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThese assets mainly comprise investments in exchange-traded commodity products that are listed, traded in active markets and valued by reference to quoted bid prices. Alternatives also includes strategic unlisted investments which are valued based on other valuation techniques utilising significant unobservable inputs.\n\n## Movements in level 3 investments\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of investments valued with reference to level 3 inputs:\n\n| LEVEL 3                                          | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January                                     | 2,285       | 1,379       |\n| Purchases                                        | 61          | 121         |\n| Disposals/transfers to assets held for sale      | (675)       | (146)       |\n| Reclassifications from level 2                   | -           | 816         |\n| Fair value movement recognised in profit or loss | 86          | 17          |\n| Foreign exchange                                 | (60)        | 98          |\n| At 31 December                                   | 1,697       | 2,285       |\n\n## 3.2.2 Charges over investments and restrictions on use\n\nA controlled entity has given fixed and floating charges over certain of its investments and other assets in order to secure the obligations of the Group's corporate members at Lloyd's as described in note 8.2.\n\nIncluded in investments are amounts totalling $3,417 million (2020 $3,071 million) which are held in Lloyd's syndicate trust funds. In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicate and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until they become distributable as profit once annual solvency requirements are met. Included in this amount is $287 million (2020 $164 million) of short-term money.\n\n## 3.2.3 Derivatives over investment assets\n\nIn accordance with our investment management policies and procedures, derivatives may be used in the investment portfolio as both a hedging tool and to alter the risk profile of the portfolio. Risk management policies over the use of derivatives are set out in note 4.\n\nQBE may also have exposure to derivatives through investments in underlying pooled funds in accordance with the fund mandate. Those derivative exposures are not included in the table below.\n\nThe Group's notional exposure to investment derivatives at the balance date is set out in the table below:\n\n| NOTIONAL EXPOSURE             | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bond futures and options      |             |             |\n| Short government bond futures | (1,751)     | (403)       |\n| Long government bond futures  | 36          | -           |\n| Short government bond options | (23)        | -           |\n| Interest rate futures         |             |             |\n| Short interest rates futures  | (1,214)     | -           |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives over investment assets are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. They are therefore initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and are remeasured to fair value through profit or loss at each reporting date. For futures and options traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices. The mark-to-market value of futures positions is cash settled on a daily basis resulting in a fair value of nil at the balance date. The fair value of options was not material at the balance date.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nQBE is in the business of managing risk. The Group's ability to satisfy customers' risk management needs is central to what we do. QBE aims to generate wealth and maximise returns for its shareholders by pursuing opportunities that involve risk. Our people are responsible for ensuring that QBE's risks are managed and controlled on a day-to-day basis. QBE aims to use its ability to properly manage risk to provide more certainty and improved outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\nQBE applies a consistent and integrated approach to enterprise risk management (ERM). QBE's framework for managing risk sets out the approach to managing risk effectively to meet strategic objectives whilst taking into account the creation of value for our shareholders. QBE's ERM framework is articulated in the Group Risk Management Strategy (RMS) and Reinsurance Management Strategy (REMS), both of which are approved annually by the Board and lodged with APRA.\n\nThe ERM framework consists of complementary elements that are embedded throughout the business management cycle and culture of the organisation. Key aspects include risk appetite, governance, reporting, risk identification and measurement, modelling and stress testing, risk systems, and risk culture.\n\nRisk management is a continuous process and an integral part of robust business management. QBE's approach is to integrate risk management into the broader management processes of the organisation. It is QBE's philosophy to ensure that risk management remains embedded in the business and that the risk makers or risk takers are themselves the risk managers. Specifically, the management of risk must occur at each point in the business management cycle.\n\nThe Group's strategy for managing risk is to:\n\n- \u00b7 achieve competitive advantage by better understanding the risk environments in which we operate;\n- \u00b7 give confidence to the business to make objective, risk-based decisions to optimise returns; and\n- \u00b7 avoid unwelcome surprises to the achievement of business objectives by reducing uncertainty and volatility through the identification and management of risks.\n\nThe framework is supported by a suite of policies that detail QBE's approach to the key risk categories used by QBE to classify risk as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 strategic risk (note 4.1);\n- \u00b7 insurance risk (note 4.2);\n- \u00b7 credit risk (note 4.3);\n- \u00b7 market risk (note 4.4);\n- \u00b7 liquidity risk (note 4.5);\n- \u00b7 operational risk (note 4.6);\n- \u00b7 compliance risk (note 4.7); and\n- \u00b7 Group risk (note 4.8).",

        "page_content": "## 4.1 Strategic risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nStrategic risk is the current and prospective impact on earnings and/or capital arising from strategic business decisions and responsiveness to external change. QBE classifies strategic risk into six subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance risk: QBE is not able to achieve its performance objectives.\n- \u00b7 Capital risk: QBE's structure and availability of capital do not meet regulatory requirements and/or support strategic initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Reputational risk: QBE's stakeholders have a negative perception of QBE's brand which may damage QBE's reputation and threaten overall performance.\n- \u00b7 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk: negative impact on QBE's strategic priorities or objectives from ESG issues.\n- \u00b7 Emerging risk: new or future risks which are difficult to assess but may have a significant impact to QBE or the markets in which it operates.\n- \u00b7 Risk culture: the norms of behaviour within QBE that determine the organisation's ability to understand, discuss and act on current and future risks.\n\nQBE's approach to managing strategic risk is underpinned by the Group strategic risk appetite statement as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Performance risk\n\nFailure to deliver acceptable performance can result in shareholders losing confidence, impacting our reputation in the market and ultimately impacting our ability to deliver our strategic objectives.\n\nQBE evaluates performance risk by assessing changing levels of risk in the business plan (supported by an established regime of attestations to the business plan by chief underwriting officers, chief actuaries, chief financial officers and chief risk officers) and taking action accordingly, prior to signing off the business plan and making market commitments. Performance risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans (supported by performance monitoring, cell reviews and mid-year performance risk reviews.)\n\n## Capital risk\n\nThe Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) outlines QBE's approach to ensuring that the Group maintains adequate capital over time and monitors compliance with regulatory capital requirements and targets. The ICAAP includes:\n\n- \u00b7 specific capital targets set in the context of QBE's risk profile, the Board's risk appetite and regulatory capital requirements;\n- \u00b7 plans for how target levels of capital are to be met; and\n- \u00b7 potential sources of additional capital, if required.\n\nThe ICAAP also sets out QBE's actions and procedures for monitoring compliance with its regulatory capital requirements and capital targets. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 the setting of triggers to alert management to potential breaches of these requirements; and\n- \u00b7 actions to avert and rectify potential breaches of these requirements.\n\nAchieving capital targets is dependent on an appropriate level and mix of capital, and effective capital management to yield adequate returns. Oversight of the Group's capital management framework is performed by senior management, the Executive Investment & Capital Committee, Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk & Capital Committee.\n\nManagement has a particular focus on the following performance indicators:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group actively manages the components of capital in order to maintain a level of eligible regulatory capital that exceeds APRA requirements. Having determined that the current risk appetite remains appropriate, the Board sets the target level of regulatory capital for 2021 at 1.6-1.8 times (2020 1.6-1.8 times) the Group's Prescribed Capital Amount (PCA).\n- \u00b7 All regulated controlled entities are required to maintain a minimum level of capital to meet obligations to policyholders. It is the Group's policy that each regulated entity maintains a capital base appropriate to its size, business mix, complexity and risk profile which fully complies with and meets or exceeds local regulatory requirements.\n- \u00b7 The Group aims to maintain the ratio of borrowings to total capital at 15%-30%. At the balance date, the ratio of borrowings to total capital was 26.9% (2020 25.8%). Excluding the subordinated debt due 2042 which is intended to be redeemed (refer to note 5.1), the ratio at the balance date was 24.1%.\n- \u00b7 Insurer financial strength ratings are provided by the major rating agencies which indicate the Group's financial strength and claims paying ability.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Reputational risk\n\nQBE assesses reputational risk through the quality of the relationships with key stakeholders, including shareholders, regulators, customers, governments, communities, employees, and third-party partners including distributors and suppliers. Each of these relationships is managed through divisional and Group teams, including corporate affairs, human resources, regulatory, compliance and distribution teams.\n\n## ESG and emerging risks\n\nQBE's ESG risk and emerging risk standards operationalise QBE's approach to managing ESG and emerging risks respectively, including climate change. Biannual horizon scans are performed on ESG and emerging risks, including assessment of potential financial and reputational impacts to the Group. Risk treatment plans are developed for material risks, which include development of underwriting and investment policy, monitoring frameworks and stress and scenario analysis. ESG and emerging risks are regularly reported to the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk & Capital Committee.\n\nClimate change is a material business risk for QBE, potentially impacting our business and customers in the medium to long term. We have considered potential short-term scenarios that could affect our insurance business written to date and our current investments, and we expect no material impact on the amounts recognised or disclosed in the financial statements. Further detail on QBE's approach to climate change is included in our climate change disclosures on pages 30 to 37 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture underpins QBE's risk management strategy and is a key component of the ERM framework.\n\nQBE is committed to, and supports, a strong risk culture. It recognises the importance of risk awareness and culture as being instrumental in the effectiveness of the ERM framework. Further information on risk culture is provided on page 28 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 4.2 Insurance risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events and claims settlements, relative to expectations.\n\nQBE classifies insurance risk into three subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 underwriting/pricing risk;\n- \u00b7 insurance concentration risk; and\n- \u00b7 reserving risk.\n\nQBE's approach to managing insurance risk is underpinned by the Group's insurance risk appetite statement which is set by the Board and is summarised below.",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting/pricing risk\n\nQBE manages underwriting/pricing risk by appropriately setting and adjusting underwriting strategy, risk selection and pricing practices throughout the underwriting cycle. Underwriting/pricing risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans underpinned by cell reviews.\n\nQBE's underwriting strategy aims to diversify and limit the type of insurance risks accepted and reduce the variability of the expected outcome. The underwriting strategy is implemented through QBE's annual business planning process, supported by minimum underwriting standards and delegated authorities. These authorities reflect the level of risk that the Group is prepared to take with respect to each permitted insurance class.\n\nPricing of risks is controlled by the use of in-house pricing models relevant to specific portfolios and the markets in which QBE operates. Underwriters and actuaries maintain pricing and claims analysis for each portfolio, combined with a knowledge of current developments in the respective markets and classes of business.\n\n## Insurance concentration risk\n\nQBE's exposure to concentrations of insurance risk is mitigated by maintaining a business portfolio that is diversified across countries and classes of business. Product diversification is pursued through a strategy of developing strong underwriting skills in a wide variety of classes of business.\n\nThe table below demonstrates the diversity of QBE's operations:\n\n| GROSS EARNED PREMIUM REVENUE     | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Commercial and domestic property | 5,031       | 4,194       |\n| Agriculture                      | 2,825       | 1,957       |\n| Public/product liability         | 1,983       | 1,647       |\n| Motor & motor casualty           | 1,937       | 1,750       |\n| Professional indemnity           | 1,644       | 1,263       |\n| Marine, energy and aviation      | 1,271       | 1,098       |\n| Workers' compensation            | 1,040       | 847         |\n| Accident and health              | 772         | 727         |\n| Financial and credit             | 511         | 465         |\n| Other                            | 21          | 60          |\n|                                  | 17,035      | 14,008      |\n\nInsurance concentration risk includes the risks from natural or man-made events that have the potential to produce claims from many of the Group's policyholders at the same time (e.g. catastrophes). QBE currently uses a variety of methodologies to monitor aggregate exposures and manage catastrophe risk. These include the use of catastrophe models from third-party vendors, realistic disaster scenarios and group aggregate methodology. QBE sets the risk appetite relating to catastrophe risk with reference to the insurance concentration risk charge (ICRC). QBE's maximum risk tolerance for an individual natural catastrophe, measured using the ICRC methodology, is determined annually and is linked to a maximum net aggregate allowance of catastrophe and large individual risk claims.\n\n## Reserving risk\n\nReserving risk is managed through the actuarial valuation of insurance liabilities, which is conducted at least half-yearly. The valuation of the net discounted central estimate of outstanding claims is performed by qualified and experienced actuaries, with reference to historical data and reasoned expectations of future experience and events. The net discounted central estimate of outstanding claims is subject to a comprehensive independent review at least annually.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.3 Credit risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss from a counterparty's failure to meet their financial obligations, including both inability or unwillingness to pay, as well as loss due to credit quality deterioration from rating downgrades. QBE's exposure to credit risk results from financial transactions with securities issuers, debtors, brokers, policyholders, reinsurers and guarantors.\n\nQBE's approach to managing credit risk is underpinned by the Group's credit risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Reinsurance credit risk\n\nThe Group's objective is to maximise placement of reinsurance with highly rated counterparties. Concentration of risk with reinsurance counterparties is monitored strictly and regularly by the Group's Security Committee and is controlled by reference to the following protocols:\n\n- \u00b7 treaty or facultative reinsurance is placed in accordance with the requirements of the Group REMS and Group Security Committee guidelines;\n- \u00b7 reinsurance arrangements are regularly reassessed to determine their effectiveness based on current exposures, historical claims and potential future claims based on the Group's insurance concentrations; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to reinsurance counterparties and the credit quality of those counterparties are actively monitored.\n\nCredit risk exposures are calculated regularly and compared with authorised credit limits. The Group is exposed to material concentrations of credit risk in relation to reinsurance recoveries at the balance date, in particular to large global reinsurers. In certain cases, the Group requires letters of credit or other collateral arrangements to be provided to guarantee the recoverability of the amount involved. Collateral held for the Group in respect of reinsurance arrangements is $1,960 million (2020 $1,098 million). The carrying amount of relevant asset classes on the balance sheet represents the maximum amount of credit exposure. Collateral held may reduce the level of credit risk associated with this exposure but does not change the total amount recoverable. The credit rating analysis below includes the impact of such security arrangements. In some cases, further security has been obtained in the form of trust arrangements, reinsurer default protection and other potential offsets. This additional security has not been included in the credit rating analysis below.\n\nThe following table provides information about the quality of the Group's credit risk exposure in respect of reinsurance recoveries at the balance date. The analysis classifies the assets according to Standard & Poor's (S&P) counterparty credit ratings. AAA is the highest possible rating. Rated assets falling outside the range of AAA to BBB are classified as speculative grade.\n\n|                                                   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   |                |            |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|------------|\n|                                                   | AAA US$M        | AA US$M         | A US$M          | BBB US$M        | NOT RATED US$M | TOTAL US$M |\n| As at 31 December 2021                            |                 |                 |                 |                 |                |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on outstanding claims 1, 2 | 2               | 4,713           | 1,662           | 55              | 64             | 6,496      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims 1           | -               | 1,701           | 388             | 4               | 25             | 2,118      |\n| As at 31 December 2020                            |                 |                 |                 |                 |                |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on outstanding claims 1, 2 | 67              | 4,613           | 1,419           | 58              | 67             | 6,224      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims 1           | 1               | 1,138           | 301             | 3               | 9              | 1,452      |",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.4 Market risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse impacts on earnings resulting from changes in market factors. Market factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\nQBE's approach to managing market risk is underpinned by the Group's market risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\nQBE's approach to managing investment market movements is underpinned by the Group's investment strategy which outlines QBE's view of the markets and its corresponding investment approach.\n\nInvestment market risk is managed through the application of exposure and asset limits. These limits are based on the market risk appetite as determined by the Board and apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 losses generated on the investment portfolio under market stress scenarios. The scenarios assume adverse movements in market factors and are designed to reflect a significant market stress event; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivities to changes in interest rate and credit spread risk, measured in terms of sensitivities to changes in risk factors such as interest rate risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nQBE is exposed to interest rate risk through its holdings in interest-bearing assets. Financial instruments with a floating interest rate expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas fixed interest rate instruments expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Interest-bearing borrowings issued by the Group are measured at amortised cost and therefore do not expose the Group result to fair value interest rate risk.\n\nQBE's risk management approach is to minimise interest rate risk by actively managing investment portfolios to achieve a balance between cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk. The Group predominantly invests in high quality, liquid interest-bearing securities and cash and may use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of the fixed interest portfolio and other financial instruments. The risk management processes over these derivative financial instruments include close senior management scrutiny, including appropriate board and other management reporting. Derivatives are used only for approved purposes and are subject to Board-approved risk appetites and delegated authority levels provided to management. The level of derivative exposure is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Appropriate segregation of duties exists with respect to derivative use, and compliance with policy, limits and other requirements is closely monitored.\n\nThe net central estimate of outstanding claims is discounted to present value by reference to risk-free interest rates. The Group is therefore exposed to potential underwriting result volatility as a result of interest rate movements. In practice, over the longer term, an increase or decrease in interest rates is normally offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in inflation. Information relating to this sensitivity is provided in note 2.3.7. At the balance date, the average modified duration of cash and fixed interest securities was 2.1 years (2020 2.1 years). Although QBE maintains a shorter asset duration relative to insurance liabilities, the Group's overall exposure to interest rate risk is not material given the quantum by which the value of fixed income assets exceeds the value of insurance liabilities.\n\nAll investments are financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Movements in interest rates impact the fair value of interest-bearing financial assets and therefore impact reported profit or loss after tax. The impact of a 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates on interest-bearing financial assets owned by the Group at the balance date is shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                            |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                            | SENSITIVITY % | 2021 US$M         | 2020 US$M         |\n| Interest rate movement - interest-bearing financial assets | +0.5          | (199)             | (186)             |\n|                                                            | -0.5          | 169               | 101               |",

        "page_content": "## Equity price risk\n\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded on the market.\n\nQBE is exposed to equity price risk on its investment in growth assets and may use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. The risk management processes over these derivative financial instruments are the same as those already explained in respect of interest rate derivative financial instruments. Exposure is also managed by diversification across international markets and currencies.\n\nGrowth assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nQBE's approach to foreign exchange management is underpinned by the Group's foreign currency strategy. The Group's foreign exchange exposure generally arises as a result of either the translation of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency of a controlled entity (operational currency risk) or due to the translation of the Group's net investments in foreign operations to the functional currency of the ultimate parent entity of Australian dollars and to QBE's presentation currency of US dollars (currency translation risk).\n\n## Operational currency risk\n\nOperational currency risk is managed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Each controlled entity manages the volatility arising from changes in foreign exchange rates by matching liabilities with assets of the same currency, as far as is practicable, thus ensuring that any exposures to foreign currencies are minimised. The Group's aim is to mitigate, where possible, its operational foreign currency exposures at a controlled entity level.\n- \u00b7 Forward foreign exchange contracts are used where possible to protect any residual currency positions. Where appropriate, forward foreign exchange contracts may also be used in relation to the Group's borrowings and may be designated as hedge relationships for accounting purposes. Further information on forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage operational currency risk is provided in note 5.6.\n\nThe risk management process relating to the use of forward foreign exchange contracts involves close senior management scrutiny. All forward foreign exchange contracts are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on profit or loss after income tax of a 10% strengthening or weakening of the major currencies against the functional currencies of the underlying QBE entities for which the Group has a material exposure at the balance date. The exposures below reflect the aggregation of operational currency exposures of multiple entities with different functional currencies. The sensitivity is measured with reference to the Group's residual (or unmatched) operational foreign currency exposures at the balance date. Operational foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The sensitivities provided demonstrate the impact of a change in one key variable in isolation while other assumptions remain unchanged.\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below are relevant only at the balance sheet date, as any unmatched exposures are actively monitored by management and the exposure subsequently matched.\n\n|                   | 2021                    | 2021          | 2021                 | 2020                    | 2020          | 2020                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M |\n| US dollar         | 198                     | +10           | 14                   | 258                     | +10           | 18                   |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (14)                 |                         | -10           | (18)                 |\n| Australian dollar | 95                      | +10           | 7                    | (55)                    | +10           | (4)                  |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (7)                  |                         | -10           | 4                    |\n\n- 1  Net of tax at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%.",

The extent of hedging this exposure is carefully managed to ensure an appropriate balance between currency risk and associated risks such as liquidity risk and stability of capital adequacy levels.\n\nQBE does not ordinarily seek to use derivatives to mitigate currency translation risk on translation to the ultimate parent entity functional currency of Australian dollars for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses generally have no cash flow;\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses are accounted for in the foreign currency translation reserve (a component of equity) and therefore do not impact profit or loss unless the related foreign operation is disposed of; and\n- \u00b7 management of translation risk needs to be balanced against the impact on capital requirements and liquidity risk.\n\nQBE may, however, elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nCurrency management processes are actively monitored by Group Treasury and involve close senior management scrutiny. All hedge transactions are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management, and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis. All instruments that are designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments .\n\nFurther information on derivatives and borrowings designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is provided in note 5.6.1.\n\nForeign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of the Group's foreign operations from the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars to the Group's US dollar presentation currency are recognised directly in equity in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The Group cannot hedge this exposure.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening against the US dollar of the major currencies to which QBE is exposed through its net investments in foreign operations. The basis for the sensitivity calculation is the Group's actual residual exposure at the balance date.\n\n|                    | 2021                    | 2021          | 2021                             | 2020                    | 2020          | 2020                             |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY  | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M |\n| Australian dollar  | 2,702                   | +10           | 270                              | 2,962                   | +10           | 296                              |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (270)                            |                         | -10           | (296)                            |\n| Euro               | 1,538                   | +10           | 154                              | 1,632                   | +10           | 163                              |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (154)                            |                         | -10           | (163)                            |\n| Sterling           | 782                     | +10           | 78                               | 150                     | +10           | 15                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (78)                             |                         | -10           | (15)                             |\n| New Zealand dollar | 278                     | +10           | 28                               | 222                     | +10           | 22                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (28)                             |                         | -10           | (22)                             |\n| Singapore dollar   | 121                     | +10           | 12                               | 120                     | +10           | 12                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (12)                             |                         | -10           | (12)                             |\n| Hong Kong dollar   | 116                     | +10           | 12                               | 36                      | +10           | 4                                |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (12)                             |                         | -10           | (4)                              |\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.5 Liquidity risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient liquid assets to meet liabilities as they fall due to policyholders and creditors or only being able to access liquidity at excessive cost.\n\nQBE's approach to managing liquidity risk is underpinned by the Group's liquidity risk appetite which is set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\nQBE manages liquidity risk using a number of tools, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 cash flow targeting;\n- \u00b7 maintenance of a minimum level of liquid assets relative to the Group's liabilities;\n- \u00b7 cash flow forecasting; and\n- \u00b7 stress testing and contingency planning.\n\nLiquidity is managed across the Group using a number of cash flow forecasting and targeting tools and techniques. Cash flow forecasting and targeting are conducted at a legal entity level and involve actively managing operational cash flow requirements.\n\nTo supplement the cash flow targeting and to ensure that there are sufficient liquid funds available to meet insurance and investment obligations, a minimum percentage of QBE's liabilities is held, at all times, in cash and liquid securities. QBE also maintains a defined proportion of the funds under management in liquid assets.\n\nQBE actively forecasts cash flow requirements to identify future cash surpluses and shortages to optimise invested cash balances and limit unexpected calls from the investment pool. The Group limits the risk of liquidity shortfalls resulting from mismatches in the timing of claims payments and receipts of claims recoveries by negotiating cash call clauses in reinsurance contracts and seeking accelerated settlements for large reinsurance recoveries.\n\nThe following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on the remaining contractual obligations. Borrowings and contractual undiscounted interest payments are disclosed by reference to the first call date of the borrowings, details of which are included in note 5.1.\n\n|                                             | LESS THAN   1 YEAR US$M   | 13 TO 36  MONTHS US$M   | 37 TO 60  MONTHS US$M   | OVER 5  YEARS US$M   | NO FIXED  TERM US$M   | TOTAL US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021                      |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Derivative financial instruments            | 130                       | 322                     | -                       | -                    | -                     | 452          |\n| Trade payables                              | 2,123                     | 191                     | 2                       | 1                    | 5                     | 2,322        |\n| Other payables and accrued  expenses        | 767                       | 46                      | 5                       | -                    | 5                     | 823          |\n| Treasury payables                           | 19                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 19           |\n| Investment payables                         | 51                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 51           |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 56                        | 90                      | 60                      | 148                  | -                     | 354          |\n| Borrowings 1                                | 442                       | 1,106                   | 1,188                   | 541                  | -                     | 3,277        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest  payments | 162                       | 268                     | 108                     | 17                   | -                     | 555          |\n| As at 31 December 2020                      |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Derivative financial instruments            | 316                       | 231                     | 298                     | -                    | -                     | 845          |\n| Trade payables                              | 1,475                     | 122                     | 3                       | -                    | 4                     | 1,604        |\n| Other payables and accrued  expenses        | 679                       | 26                      | 3                       | -                    | 6                     | 714          |\n| Treasury payables                           | 16                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 16           |\n| Investment payables                         | 4                         | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 4            |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 68                        | 103                     | 84                      | 176                  | -                     | 431          |\n| Borrowings 1                                | 200                       | 854                     | 1,000                   | 909                  | -                     | 2,963        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest  payments | 191                       | 326                     | 194                     | 23                   | -                     | 734          |\n\n- 1  Excludes capitalised finance costs of $9 million (2020 $8 million).\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's net discounted central estimate is analysed in note 2.3.6.",

|\n\n## 4.6 Operational risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.\n\nOperational risk can materialise in a number of forms including fraud perpetrated by employees or by external parties (e.g. claims fraud or cyber attacks), employment practices (e.g. losses arising from breaches of employment, health or safety laws), improper business practices (e.g. failure to meet professional obligations or issues with the nature or design of an insurance product), business disruption and system failures, or business and transaction processing failures.\n\nQBE manages operational risk through setting policy, minimum standards, and process and system controls, including effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisations and reconciliation procedures, business continuity management, fraud management, information security and physical security.\n\nQBE identifies, assesses and manages operational risk through the:\n\n- \u00b7 risk and control self-assessment process, which identifies and assesses the key risks to achieving business objectives and is conducted at the business unit level;\n- \u00b7 operational risk appetite statement, which sets out the nature and level of risk that the Board and Group Executive Committee are willing to take in pursuit of the organisation's objectives. The operational risk appetite statement is measured through an assessment of the control environment, key risk indicators, issues and incidents; and\n- \u00b7 scenario analysis process, which assesses the impact of potentially extreme scenarios and the appropriateness of our contingency planning.\n\nKey residual risks from the above processes are monitored by the Executive Risk Committee.\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.7 Compliance risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory penalties, financial loss or impacts and non-financial loss or impacts (including reputational damage) resulting from a breach of obligations. Obligations refer to those in legislation, regulation, industry codes and standards, internal policies and ethical and business standards.\n\nQBE's approach to managing compliance risk is underpinned by the Group risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\nQBE manages compliance risk through its governance, culture, stakeholder management and strategy approach. There are six components for managing compliance risk:\n\n- \u00b7 identify compliance obligations and controls;\n- \u00b7 embed compliance obligations across systems and processes;\n- \u00b7 communicate and train staff on compliance requirements;\n- \u00b7 monitor obligations and controls;\n- \u00b7 identify and rectify incidents, issues and breaches; and\n- \u00b7 report on and assess the state of compliance.\n\nCompliance management is subject to continuous improvement, recognising changes in the regulatory and legal environment and industry, customer and community expectations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.8 Group risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nGroup risk is the risk to a division arising specifically from being part of the wider Group, including financial impact and loss of support from the Company.\n\nQBE's approach to managing Group risk is supported by divisional Group risk appetite statements where divisions define the Board-approved plan to address identified Group risk exposures. Sources of Group risk are summarised below.\n\nSources of Group risk may include:\n\n- \u00b7 shared global reinsurance program, including counterparty risk of Equator Re;\n- \u00b7 intercompany loans;\n- \u00b7 contagion reputational risk;\n- \u00b7 credit agency dependency;\n- \u00b7 use of Group functions where there is a global operating model in place;\n- \u00b7 use of QBE's internal asset management function - Group Investments;\n- \u00b7 Group initiatives or decisions with a material impact on one or more divisions; and\n- \u00b7 liquidity and central foreign exchange management.\n\nQBE manages Group risk through various systems, controls and processes, including the management of reinsurance arrangements, use of intercompany transactions and balances accounting guidance, transfer pricing guidelines, investment management agreements, capital planning and assessments of the use of Group functions, Group initiatives and contagion reputational events.",

Borrowings are diversified across currencies and tenure.\n\nDetails of the Group's approach to capital risk management are disclosed in note 4.1.\n\n## 5.1 Borrowings\n\n| FINAL MATURITY DATE                                      | I SSUE DATE                                              | PRINCIPAL AMOUNT                                         | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Senior debt                                              |                                                          |                                                          |             |             |\n| 25 May 2023                                              | 25 September 2017                                        | $6 million                                               | 6           | 6           |\n|                                                          |                                                          |                                                          | 6           | 6           |\n| Subordinated debt                                        |                                                          |                                                          |             |             |\n| 25 August 2036                                           | 25 August 2020                                           | A$500 million 1                                          | 362         | 385         |\n| 13 September 2038                                        | 13 September 2021                                        | \u00a3400 million (2020 nil)                                  | 538         | -           |\n| 24 May 2041                                              | 24 May 2011                                              | Nil (2020 $167 million)                                  | -           | 167         |\n| 24 May 2041                                              | 24 May 2011                                              | Nil (2020 \u00a324 million)                                   | -           | 33          |\n| 24 May 2042                                              | 24 May 2016                                              | \u00a3327 million                                             | 442         | 445         |\n| 24 November 2043                                         | 21 November 2016                                         | $400 million/A$689 million 1                             | 400         | 400         |\n| 2 December 2044                                          | 2 December 2014                                          | $700 million/A$1,169 million                             | 698         | 697         |\n| 12 November 2045                                         | 12 November 2015                                         | $300 million                                             | 300         | 300         |\n| 17 June 2046                                             | 17 June 2016                                             | $524 million                                             | 522         | 522         |\n|                                                          |                                                          |                                                          | 3,262       | 2,949       |\n| Total borrowings 2                                       |                                                          |                                                          | 3,268       | 2,955       |\n| Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months          | Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months          | Amounts expected to be settled within 12 months          | 442         | 200         |\n| Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months | Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months | Amounts expected to be settled in greater than 12 months | 2,826       | 2,755       |\n| Total borrowings                                         | Total borrowings                                         | Total borrowings                                         | 3,268       | 2,955       |\n\n- 1  Details of related hedging activity are included in note 5.6.1.\n- 2  $3 million of finance costs (2020 $2 million) were capitalised during the year.\n\n## Subordinated debt key terms\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2036\n\nInterest is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate equal to the three-month BBSW rate plus a margin of 2.75% per annum.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2038\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 2.5% per annum until 13 September 2028.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2041\n\nThe securities were redeemed on 8 March 2021. Interest was payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 7.25% per annum on the US dollar denominated debt and 7.5% per annum on the sterling debt.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2042\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 6.115% per annum until 24 May 2022. The rate will reset in 2022, 2027, 2032 and 2037 to a rate calculated by reference to the then five-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 5.0% per annum. The securities are intended to be redeemed.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2043\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 7.50% per annum until 24 November 2023. The rate will reset in 2023 and 2033 to a rate calculated by reference to the then 10-year US dollar swap rate plus a margin of 6.03% per annum.\n\nQBE has an option to defer payment of interest in certain circumstances and such deferral will not constitute an event of default.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2044\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 6.75% per annum until 2 December 2024, at which time the rate will reset to a 10-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 4.3% per annum. The rate will reset again, on the same basis, on 2 December 2034.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2045\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 6.1% per annum until 12 November 2025, at which time the rate will reset to a 10-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 3.993% per annum. The rate will reset again, on the same basis, on 12 November 2035.\n\n## Subordinated debt due 2046\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of 5.875% per annum until 17 June 2026. The rate will reset in 2026 and 2036 to a rate calculated by reference to the then 10-year mid-market swap rate plus a margin of 4.395% per annum.\n\n## Redemption terms\n\nThe securities are redeemable at the option of QBE, with the prior written approval of APRA, at any time in the event of certain tax and regulatory events and on:\n\n- \u00b7 25 August 2026 and each interest payment date thereafter for securities due 2036;\n- \u00b7 any business day within the six-month period up to and including the first reset date of 13 September 2028 and on each reset date thereafter for securities due 2038; and\n- \u00b7 each reset date for securities due 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045 and 2046.\n\n## Conversion terms\n\nThe securities due 2036, 2038, 2042, 2043, 2044, 2045 and 2046 must be converted into a variable number of the Company's ordinary shares, or written off, if APRA determines QBE to be non-viable. The conversion rate is subject to a price floor of 20% of the VWAP of the shares in the five trading days before the date of issue of the securities.\n\n## Security arrangements\n\nThe claims of bondholders pursuant to the subordinated debt will be subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all senior creditors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nBorrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs directly attributable to the transaction and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised through profit or loss over the period of the financial liability using the effective interest method.",

The fair value of the Group's borrowings is categorised as level 2 fair value measurements. Fixed and floating rate securities are priced using broker quotes and comparable prices for similar instruments in active markets. Where no active market exists, floating rate resettable notes are priced at par plus accrued interest.\n\n## 5.1.2 Financing and other costs\n\n|                                 |   2021 US$M |   2020 US$M |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Interest expense on borrowings  |         177 |         188 |\n| Other costs                     |          70 |          64 |\n| Total financing and other costs |         247 |         252 |\n\n## 5.1.3 Movement in borrowings\n\n|                                                  | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January                                     | 2,955       | 3,095       |\n| Net changes from financing cash flows            | 348         | 218         |\n| Reclassification of Additional Tier 1 instrument | -           | (399)       |\n| Other non-cash changes                           | 2           | (1)         |\n| Foreign exchange                                 | (37)        | 42          |\n| At 31 December                                   | 3,268       | 2,955       |\n\n## 5.2 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                        |   2021 US$M |   2020 US$M |\n|------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Fixed interest rate    |          14 |          13 |\n| Floating interest rate |         805 |         753 |\n|                        |         819 |         766 |\n\n## Restrictions on use\n\nIncluded in cash and cash equivalents are amounts totalling $74 million (2020 $73 million) which are held in Lloyd's syndicate trust funds. In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicates and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until allowed to be distributed as profit once annual solvency requirements are met.\n\nAlso included in cash and cash equivalents is $125 million (2020 $110 million) relating to policyholder trust accounts in the United Kingdom which can only be accessed by QBE in certain circumstances, such as when QBE is owed a deductible by the policyholder on a claim. The Group recognises a corresponding payable in relation to these until such an event occurs.\n\nQBE has operations in many countries which have foreign exchange controls and regulations. These controls and regulations can vary from simple reporting requirements to outright prohibition of movement of funds without explicit prior central bank or regulator approval. The impact of these controls and regulations may restrict the Group's capacity to repatriate capital and/or profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and on hand and deposits at call which are readily convertible to cash on hand and which are used for operational cash requirements. Amounts in cash and cash equivalents are the same as those included in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe reconciliation of profit or loss after income tax to net cash flows from operating activities is included in note 8.4.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n## 5.6 Derivatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nDerivatives may be used as a tool to hedge the Group's foreign exchange exposures. Each controlled entity manages operational foreign exchange volatility by matching liabilities with assets of the same currency, as far as practicable. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to manage residual currency exposures, with both the foreign exchange gains or losses on translation of the exposure and the mark-to-market of related derivatives reported through profit or loss. Forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased currency options may also be utilised in cash flow hedging of foreign currency borrowings and/or exposure to net investments in foreign operations (NIFO).\n\nInterest rate swaptions are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movements on the Group's borrowings.\n\nRefer to note 4.4 for additional information relating to QBE's approach to managing interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe Group's exposure to treasury derivatives at the balance date determined by reference to the functional currency of the relevant controlled entity is set out in the table below:\n\n|                                                               | 2021          | 2021                   | 2021                       | 2020          | 2020                   | 2020                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                               | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts   not in designated hedges | 2,143         | 118                    | 161                        | 2,603         | 505                    | 394                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in cash flow hedges  | (1,599)       | -                      | 291                        | (1,796)       | -                      | 419                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in NIFO hedges       | 489           | 11                     | -                          | (345)         | 13                     | 32                         |\n| Interest rate swaptions                                       | 363           | 13                     | -                          | 385           | 2                      | -                          |\n|                                                               |               | 142                    | 452                        |               | 520                    | 845                        |\n\nThe fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaptions are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. They are fair valued using present value techniques utilising observable market data, broker quotes and/or comparable prices for similar instruments in active markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss at each reporting date, unless the derivative is designated as part of a qualifying hedge relationship (refer to note 5.6.1).\n\n## 5.6.1 Designated hedges\n\nThe Group's material designated hedge relationships are analysed below by risk category and are accounted for with reference to the accounting policies set out at the end of this note. Hedging ratios, being the relationship between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item, are 1:1 as the nominal values of hedging instruments match those of the hedged items. Any ineffectiveness arising from factors such as credit risk is not expected to be material. Amounts recognised in equity or reclassified to profit or loss are disclosed in note 5.3.2.\n\n## Cash /flow hedges of borrowings\n\nAt the balance date, forward foreign exchange contracts were used to hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions in relation to $400 million of subordinated notes maturing in 2043 and $700 million of subordinated notes maturing in 2044. Foreign currency risk on future coupons and principal amounts is hedged up to and including the first call dates of the notes, being 2023 and 2024 respectively. Similarly, an interest rate swaption was put in place to hedge interest rate risk in relation to coupons on A$500 million of subordinated notes maturing in 2036. The swaption is exercisable in August 2023 and hedges coupon payments from that date to the first call date in August 2026. These hedges were put in place to more effectively manage currency exposures and costs of funding.",

        "page_content": "Only the spot components of the forward foreign exchange contracts and the intrinsic value of the interest rate swaption are designated in hedge relationships. For forward foreign exchange contracts, reclassifications of hedging gains and losses to profit or loss are included in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1), consistent with the currency movement of the hedged borrowings. For the interest rate swaption, reclassifications of any cumulative hedging gains or losses to profit or loss will occur as related coupon payments are made during the period from August 2023 to August 2026. A 'cost of hedging' election was made in respect of these hedges, as described below, and amortisation of the forward and currency basis components is included in financing costs (refer to note 5.1.2) where they relate to hedged coupons, or in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1) where they relate to principal amounts.\n\nThe interest rate swaption does not generate any cash flows until August 2023, when the potential settlement would occur if the swaption is in-the-money at that point in time. The timing of cash flows relating to the forward foreign exchange contracts and corresponding average forward rates are provided in the following table:\n\n|                      |                        | 2021              | 2021          | 2021          | 2020              | 2020          | 2020          |\n|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                      |                        | LESS THAN  1 YEAR | 1 TO 5  YEARS | OVER 5  YEARS | LESS THAN  1 YEAR | 1 TO 5  YEARS | OVER 5  YEARS |\n| Nominal amounts      | Buy US$M/     Sell A$M | 77/130            | 1,225/2,071   | -             | 77/129            | 1,301/2,200   | -             |\n| Average forward rate | US$/A$                 | 0.60              | 0.59          | -             | 0.60              | 0.59          | -             |\n\n## Hedges of currency risk relating to translation of net investments in foreign operations\n\nAt the balance date, forward foreign exchange contracts and borrowings were designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Only the spot components of the forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as being in hedge relationships. The forward and currency basis components are included in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1). Cumulative hedging gains or losses recognised in equity are recycled to profit or loss only on disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nThe timing of cash flows relating to the hedging instruments and corresponding average forward rates, if applicable, are provided in the following table, with borrowings being disclosed by reference to their first call dates (refer to note 5.1):\n\n|                                                                         |                                                                         | 2021                                                                    | 2021                                                                    | 2021                                                                    | 2020                                                                    | 2020                                                                    | 2020                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                         |                                                                         | MATURING IN:                                                            | MATURING IN:                                                            | MATURING IN:                                                            | MATURING IN:                                                            | MATURING IN:                                                            | MATURING IN:                                                            |\n|                                                                         |                                                                         | LESS THAN  1 YEAR                                                       | 1 TO 5  YEARS                                                           | OVER 5  YEARS                                                           | LESS THAN  1 YEAR                                                       | 1 TO 5  YEARS                                                           | OVER 5  YEARS                                                           |\n| Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          | Debt instruments used in US dollar NIFO hedges                          |\n| Subordinated debt                                                       | US$M                                                                    | -

CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nWhen a derivative or other financial instrument is designated in a qualifying hedge relationship, the relevant controlled entity formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedging transactions. The relevant entity also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are met, including the relevant economic relationship, the effect of credit risk and the hedge ratio.\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument associated with the effective portion of the hedge is accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item also affects profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, this is reflected in the cash flow hedge reserve; for hedges of net investments in foreign operations, this is reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve (refer to note 5.3.2). The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nWhere the forward and currency basis components of a designated derivative do not form part of the designated hedge relationship, these components are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless a 'cost of hedging' election is made. Under this election, the fair value of these components at inception of the hedge are amortised through profit or loss over time periods relevant to the hedge, with other changes in their fair values after inception recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. This election can be made on a hedge-by-hedge basis and is reflected in the cost of hedging reserve (refer to note 5.3.2).\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the qualifying hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, including when the risk management objective is no longer met or is no longer relevant; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; the hedged item matures, is sold or repaid; or a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the hedged item is a forecast transaction that is no longer considered highly probable, the cumulative gain or loss is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. When a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss at that time remains in equity and is only recycled to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation, forming part of the resulting gain or loss.",

TAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIncome tax expense or credit is the accounting tax outcome for the period and is calculated as the tax payable on the current period taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and unused tax losses. The relationship between accounting profit or loss and income tax expense or credit is provided in the reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense or credit (refer to note 6.1). Income tax expense does not equate to the amount of tax actually paid to tax authorities around the world, as it is based upon the accrual accounting concept.\n\nAccounting income and expenses do not always have the same recognition pattern as taxable income and expenses, creating a timing difference as to when a tax expense or credit can be recognised. These differences usually reverse over time but, until they do, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet. Note 6.2 details the composition and movements in deferred tax balances and the key management assumptions applied in recognising tax losses.\n\nDetails of franking credits available to shareholders are disclosed in note 5.4.\n\n## 6.1 Reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense or credit\n\n|                                                                | NOTE   | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Profit (loss) before income tax                                |        | 913         | (1,472)     |\n| Prima facie tax expense (credit) at 30%                        |        | 274         | (442)       |\n| Tax effect of non-temporary differences:                       |        |             |             |\n| Untaxed dividends                                              |        | (2)         | (1)         |\n| Differences in tax rates                                       |        | (93)        | 109         |\n| Other, including non-allowable expenses and non-taxable income |        | (2)         | 75          |\n| Prima facie tax adjusted for non-temporary differences         |        | 177         | (259)       |\n| Deferred tax assets (re-recognised) de-recognised              |        | (18)        | 278         |\n| (Overprovision) underprovision in prior years                  |        | (3)         | 20          |\n| Income tax expense                                             |        | 156         | 39          |\n| Analysed as follows:                                           |        |             |             |\n| Current tax                                                    |        | 169         | 59          |\n| Deferred tax                                                   |        | (13)        | (20)        |\n|                                                                |        | 156         | 39          |\n| Deferred tax (credit) expense comprises:                       |        |             |             |\n| Deferred tax assets recognised in profit or loss               | 6.2.1  | (57)        | (125)       |\n| Deferred tax liabilities recognised in profit or loss          | 6.2.2  | 44          | 105         |\n|                                                                |        | (13)        | (20)        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe current income tax expense or credit is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which controlled entities operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as appropriate.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n6",

In making this assessment, QBE considers in particular each controlled entity's future business plans, history of generating taxable profits, whether the unused tax losses resulted from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur and if any tax planning opportunities exist in the period in which the taxable losses can be utilised.\n\nThe recognised deferred tax asset relating to the North American tax group of $295 million (2020 $295 million) comprises $105 million (2020 $117 million) of carry forward tax losses and $190 million (2020 $178 million) of deductible temporary differences, net of applicable offsetting deferred tax liabilities, as a result of insurance technical reserves and the tax deductibility of goodwill and other intangibles.\n\nUncertainty continues to exist in relation to the utilisation of this asset, which is subject to there being continued future taxable profits over the period of time in which the losses can be utilised. QBE has made a judgement that the North American tax group will be able to generate sufficient taxable profits over the foreseeable future, based upon its future business plans. Key assumptions include an expectation of future taxable profit driven by no material deterioration in the prior accident year central estimate, a sustained return to underwriting profitability, benefits flowing from initiatives to reduce the cost base of the division and future increases in investment yields. Losses expire over the next 19 years, with the majority expiring between 2031 and 2040. The uncertainty around the recognition of the deferred tax asset will be resolved in future years if taxable profits are generated. Recovery of the asset continues to be sensitive to changes in the combined operating ratio, premium growth and investment yield assumptions as these items are the key drivers of future taxable profits.\n\nWe continue to monitor developments in global tax reform led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for potential impacts on the Group's deferred tax balances.\n\n## 6.2.2 Deferred tax liabilities\n\n|                                                             | NOTE   | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Amounts recognised in profit or loss                        |        |             |             |\n| Intangible assets                                           |        | 155         | 143         |\n| Insurance provisions                                        |        | 556         | 531         |\n| Financial assets - fair value movements                     |        | 2           | 7           |\n| Other provisions                                            |        | 38          | 27          |\n| Other                                                       |        | 83          | 92          |\n|                                                             |        | 834         | 800         |\n| Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income and equity |        |             |             |\n| Defined benefit plans                                       |        | 20          | 11          |\n|                                                             |        | 20          | 11          |\n| Deferred tax liabilities before set-off                     |        | 854         | 811         |\n| Set-off of deferred tax assets                              | 6.2.1  | (823)       | (760)       |\n|                                                             | 6.2    | 31          | 51          |\n\nMovements\n\n|                                                  | NOTE   | 2021 US$M   |   2020 US$M |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January                                     |        | 811         |         686 |\n| Amounts recognised in profit or loss             | 6.1    | 44          |         105 |\n| Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income |        | 8           |           6 |\n| Foreign exchange                                 |        | (9)         |          14 |\n| At 31 December                                   |        | 854         |         811 |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nD\n\nR\n\ni\n\nr\n\ne\n\np\n\ne\n\no\n\nr\n\nct\n\nt\n\no\n\nrs\n\n'\n\n5\n\n6",

TAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDeferred income tax is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the controlled entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the consolidated financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\n## 6.2.3 Tax losses\n\nThe Group has not brought to account $402 million (2020 $414 million) of tax losses, which includes the benefit arising from tax losses in overseas countries. $78 million (2020 $66 million) of tax losses not brought to account have an indefinite life and the remaining $324 million (2020 $348 million) expire in nine to 19 years. The benefits of unused tax losses will only be brought to account when it is probable that they will be realised.\n\nThis benefit of tax losses will only be obtained if:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group derives future assessable income of a nature and an amount sufficient to enable the benefit from the deductions for the losses to be realised;\n- \u00b7 the Group continues to comply with the conditions for deductibility imposed by tax legislation; and\n- \u00b7 no changes in tax legislation adversely affect the Group in realising the benefit from the deductions for the losses.\n\n## 6.2.4 Tax consolidation legislation\n\nOn adoption of the tax consolidation legislation, the Company and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities entered into a tax sharing and tax funding agreement that requires the Australian entities to fully compensate the Company for current tax liabilities and to be fully compensated by the Company for any current tax or deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses arising from external transactions occurring after the date of implementation of the tax consolidation legislation. The contributions are allocated by reference to the notional taxable income of each Australian entity. The head entity is QBE Insurance Group Limited.",

        "page_content": "## 7. GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section provides information to help users understand the Group structure, including the impact of changes in the financial year. This includes acquisitions and disposals of businesses, intangible assets acquired or developed and the results of impairment reviews.\n\n## 7.1 Intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIntangible assets are assets with no physical substance. The most significant classes of intangible assets are detailed below:\n\n## Lloyd's syndicate capacity\n\nThe Lloyd's syndicate capacity intangible asset relates to the syndicate capacity acquired as part of the acquisition of QBE Underwriting Limited (formerly trading as Limit) in 2000 and costs incurred as a result of increasing capacity since that date. Syndicate capacity is the aggregate of the premium limits of each member of that syndicate at a point in time. An existing capital provider has the first right to participate on the next year of account, giving the indefinite right to participate on all future years of account. The Group has demonstrated a long-term commitment to developing its operations at Lloyd's. The value of this asset is in the access it gives to future underwriting profits at Lloyd's. For these reasons, Lloyd's syndicate capacity is deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\n\n## Customer relationships\n\nCustomer relationships comprise the capitalisation of future profits relating to insurance contracts acquired and the expected renewal of those contracts. It also includes the value of distribution networks and agency relationships. Customer relationships are amortised over remaining lives of up to eight years depending on the classes of business to which the assets relate.\n\n## Brand names\n\nThese assets reflect the revenue generating ability of acquired brands. In some circumstances, brand names are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to the long-term nature of the asset.\n\n## Insurance licences\n\nThese assets give the Group the right to operate in certain geographic locations and to write certain classes of business with a potential to generate additional revenue. In some cases, these are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to their long-term nature; however, where there is a finite useful life, assets are amortised over the remaining period, up to 15 years.\n\n## So/f\\_tware\n\nThis includes both acquired and internally developed software which is not integral or closely related to an item of hardware such as an underwriting system. Capitalised software is amortised over periods of up to 10 years, reflecting the period during which the Group is expected to benefit from the use of the software.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and therefore is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually, or more often if there is an indication of impairment.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Those with a finite useful life are amortised over their estimated useful life in accordance with the pattern of expected consumption of economic benefits, with amortisation expense reported in underwriting and other expenses or in amortisation and impairment of intangibles depending on the use of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",

Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored for impairment by QBE. As the Group acquires or disposes of operations or reorganises the way that operations are managed, reporting structures may change, giving rise to a reassessment of cash-generating units and the allocation of goodwill to those cash-generating units.\n\nThe goodwill relating to certain acquisitions is denominated in currencies other than the US dollar and so is subject to foreign exchange movements.\n\nGoodwill is analysed by groups of cash-generating units as follows:\n\n|                   | 2021 US$M   | 2020 US$M   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| North America     | 358         | 358         |\n| International     | 524         | 546         |\n| Australia Pacific | 1,134       | 1,203       |\n|                   | 2,016       | 2,107       |\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nDuring 2021, insurance licences of $2 million were impaired.\n\nDuring 2020, $390 million of goodwill relating to North America and $48 million of identifiable intangible assets were impaired.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\n## Impairment testing of identi/fiable intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of each intangible asset with an indefinite useful life has been determined by reference to a value in use calculation based on the following key assumptions and estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow forecasts relevant to the initial valuation of the identifiable intangible asset are reviewed and updated (if appropriate). Cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of actual performance to date and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates include a beta and a market risk premium sourced from observable market information and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the risk associated with the intangible asset or the cash-generating unit to which the asset is allocated.\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units has been determined by reference to a value in use calculation based on the following key assumptions and estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow forecasts reflect combined operating ratio and investment return assumptions that build from the latest three-year business plan. These forecasts cover a period of five years, with the final two years determined with reference to the terminal growth rates discussed below. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of historical performance and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors and the benefit of committed cost saving measures.\n- \u00b7 Terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth formula from the end of the cash flow forecast period. Growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates of the countries relevant to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units and are based on observable market information. The terminal growth rates used in impairment testing are: North America 2.3% (2020 2.3%), Australia Pacific 2.5% (2020 2.5%) and International 2.0% (2020 2.0%).\n- \u00b7 Discount rates reflect a beta and a market risk premium sourced from observable market information and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the business of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates used were: North America 9.7% (2020 9.8%), Australia Pacific 12.8% (2020 12.5%) and International 8.9% (2020 9.0%). The post-tax discount rates used were: North America 7.6% (2020 7.8%), Australia Pacific 9.1% (2020 9.1%) and International 7.2% (2020 7.3%).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nBased on the detailed impairment test completed in respect of goodwill relating to North America, the headroom (being the excess of recoverable value over carrying value) at the current balance date increased to $83 million compared with nil at 31 December 2020. The valuation continues to be highly sensitive to a range of assumptions, in particular the forecast combined operating ratio used in the terminal value calculation, discount rate and long-term investment return. The impact of changes in these key assumptions is shown in the table below and each change has been calculated in isolation from other changes. In practice, this is considered unlikely to occur due to interrelationships between assumptions.\n\n| KEY ASSUMPTION                          | ASSUMPTION  %   |   SENSITIVITY % | IMPACT OF SENSITIVITY ON CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL   | ASSUMPTION  AT WHICH  HEADROOM IS NIL %   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Terminal value combined operating ratio | 98.5            |              +1 | Impairment of $358 million                            | 98.7                                      |\n|                                         | (2020 98.5)     |              -1 | Increase headroom to $641 million                     |                                           |\n| Long-term investment return             | 3.43            |              +1 | Increase headroom to $863 million                     | 3.33                                      |\n|                                         | (2020 3.75)     |              -1 | Impairment of $358 million                            |                                           |\n| Post-tax discount rate                  | 7.6             |              +1 | Impairment of $358 million                            | 7.8                                       |\n|                                         | (2020 7.8)      |              -1 | Increase headroom to $733 million                     |                                           |",

All transactions between and with controlled entities are eliminated in full. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of controlled entities are shown separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere control of an entity commences during a financial year, its results are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained. Where control of an entity ceases during a financial year, its results are included for that part of the year during which the control existed.\n\nA change in ownership of a controlled entity without the gain or loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6",

An assessment of the financial impact of the standards and amendments has been undertaken and they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements, except where noted below.\n\n## AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nAASB 17, a new accounting standard for insurance contracts, was adopted by the AASB in July 2017. In June 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 17 which deferred the effective date from 1 January 2021 to 1 January 2023 and made significant amendments to the standard in response to feedback from, and implementation issues raised by, stakeholders. These amendments were adopted by the AASB in July 2020.\n\n## Measurement of insurance contracts\n\n## Measurement models\n\nThe standard introduces a new 'general model' for the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. The liability for remaining coverage (which represents insurance coverage to be provided after the balance date) under the general model is measured as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the present value of expected future cash flows and a risk adjustment (collectively referred to as the 'fulfilment cash flows'); and\n- \u00b7 a contractual service margin, being the unearned profit, which is recognised as insurance revenue in profit or loss over the coverage period of the contracts. The contractual service margin is earned based on a pattern of coverage units which may not be the same as the pattern of incidence of risk used to earn gross written premium under AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts (AASB 1023).",

    {
        "page_content": "AASB 17 permits the use of a simplified approach (which is similar to the current basis on which general insurance is brought to account under AASB 1023) if the liability for remaining coverage under the simplified approach is not expected to materially differ from that under the general model, or if the coverage period of the contracts is less than one year. QBE has developed a model and methodology for assessing eligibility of contracts with coverage periods of greater than one year to apply the simplified approach. Our preliminary assessment, which involves detailed modelling under a range of scenarios as well as a qualitative assessment of contract features, has determined that the simplified approach is expected to apply to more than 98% of the Group's business based on gross written premium.\n\nFor groups of contracts that apply the simplified approach and have a coverage period of one year or less, AASB 17 provides an option to recognise any insurance acquisition costs as expenses when incurred. QBE does not plan to apply this option and expects to amortise acquisition costs over the coverage period of the related insurance contracts, consistent with current accounting under AASB 1023.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nAASB 17 requires the identification of 'groups' of onerous contracts which are expected to be determined at a more granular level of aggregation than the level at which the liability adequacy test is performed under AASB 1023. Contracts that are measured using the simplified approach are assumed not to be onerous unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. QBE has developed a framework for identifying relevant facts and circumstances that may be indicators of possible onerous contracts which includes consideration of management information provided to the Group Executive Committee for planning and performance management purposes.\n\nIf such facts and circumstances that may be indicators of possible onerous contracts exist, the onerous contract losses are measured based on an estimation of fulfilment cash flows and are recognised in profit or loss. Models for measuring potential onerous contract losses are currently being developed, tested and approved. Onerous contract losses must be measured on a gross basis (excluding the effect of reinsurance), with the impact on equity and profit or loss mitigated by the deduction of related income on reinsurance recoveries to the extent that the onerous contracts are covered by reinsurance. The financial impact is still being determined but the application of the onerous contracts requirements could result in a decrease in opening equity on adoption of AASB 17.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe measurement of insurance contract liabilities will include a risk adjustment which replaces the risk margin under AASB 1023. The risk margin under AASB 1023 reflects the inherent uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate, whereas the risk adjustment is defined as the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty that arises from non-financial risk. Similar to the risk margin, the risk adjustment includes the benefit of diversification. AASB 17 requires the disclosure of the confidence level that corresponds to the risk adjustment used in the measurement of insurance contract liabilities. The application of the AASB 17 requirements is one of substantial judgement and QBE is currently defining the methodology for determining the risk adjustment and, in doing so, is giving consideration to evolving industry interpretation. Given QBE's ongoing work on this complex component of the standard, the financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at the balance date.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nAASB 1023 requires the net central estimate of outstanding claims to be discounted using risk-free rates as described in note 2.3.4. AASB 17 requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted to reflect the time value of money and financial risks related to those cash flows but does not prescribe a methodology for determining the discount rates used. QBE expects to apply a 'bottom-up approach' which uses risk-free rates adjusted to reflect the illiquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts, which could result in higher discount rates relative to current requirements. The methodology and impact of reflecting illiquidity within discount rates is currently being determined.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nInsurance contract assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currency are treated as monetary items under AASB 17. This differs from current industry practice in respect of unearned premium and deferred insurance costs which are treated as non-monetary items. The financial impact of this change will be known once the other measurement impacts of AASB 17 have been determined and will be impacted by the exchange rates at the balance date. QBE will reassess its operational and translational currency exposures, as well as related risk management strategies, once the impacts are reasonably estimable.\n\n## Interim reporting\n\nAASB 17 provides an option to change the treatment of accounting estimates made in interim financial statements when applying AASB 17 in the subsequent annual financial statements (i.e. a 'year-to-date basis'). QBE expects to apply this option and will measure accounting estimates on a year-to-date basis which is consistent with current practice.\n\n## Presentation and disclosure\n\nThe standard introduces significant changes to the presentation and disclosure of insurance line items in the financial statements, introducing new line items on the balance sheet and statement of comprehensive income and increased disclosure requirements compared with existing reporting requirements.\n\nExisting insurance and reinsurance contract line items on the balance sheet (including trade debtors arising from general insurance contracts, unearned premium, deferred insurance costs, gross outstanding claims and reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims) will be replaced with insurance contract assets and liabilities, and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities. Insurance contract liabilities under AASB 17 will include all cash flows that directly relate to the fulfillment of insurance contracts (direct and inward reinsurance), including acquisition, claims settlement, policy administration and maintenance costs. It also includes other costs such as direct overheads which are currently recognised in trade and other payables on the balance sheet.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

OTHER\n\n## Transition\n\nAASB 17 will be applied retrospectively to all of QBE's insurance contracts on transition except to the extent that it is impracticable to do so, in which case either a modified retrospective or fair value approach may be applied. QBE expects to apply a modified retrospective approach to certain contracts acquired in the past (e.g. as part of a business combination) that, at the time of acquisition, were considered past expiry and were in their claims settlement period. For these contracts, the related liabilities are expected to be classified as liabilities for incurred claims, on the basis that it would be impracticable to treat these liabilities as related to unexpired coverage. QBE is currently performing an assessment to conclude on the expected transition approach to be applied for the remainder of the business.\n\n## Financial impact\n\nThe requirements of AASB 17 are complex and the expectations noted above are subject to change as the implementation progresses and as QBE continues to analyse the impacts of the standard and recent amendments. Market developments also continue to be monitored in order to assess the impact of evolving interpretations and other changes. The financial impact of adopting AASB 17 cannot be reasonably estimated at the date of this report. QBE intends to disclose the potential financial impact of adopting AASB 17 once it is practical to provide a reliable estimate.\n\n## Implementation progress\n\nQBE has performed an impact assessment which identified the key areas of expected impact. Group-wide accounting guidance and application methodologies are being developed, and a global implementation team has been mobilised to progress the detailed design and implementation of required changes to financial reporting systems.\n\nIn addition to concluding on methodology decisions in relation to the areas of judgement described above, the implementation team is currently focused on the development and testing of actuarial models as well as the implementation of changes to finance systems and reporting processes. Complementing these changes, QBE's transition approach also includes the development and delivery of training to the global finance teams and relevant stakeholders on the new requirements and their practical application.\n\n## 8.2 Contingent liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nContingent liabilities are disclosed when the possibility of a future settlement of economic benefits is considered to be less than probable but more likely than remote. If the expected settlement of the liability becomes probable, a provision is recognised.\n\nQBE is required to support the underwriting activities of the Group's controlled entities including corporate members at Lloyd's. Funds at Lloyd's are those funds of the Group which are subject to the terms of the Lloyd's Deposit Trust Deed and are required to support underwriting for the following year and the open years of account, determined by a formula prescribed by Lloyd's each year. At the balance date, letters of credit and similar forms of support of $2,177 million (2020 $2,085 million) were in place in respect of the Group's participation in Lloyd's, along with cash and investments of $106 million (2020 $250 million). In addition, a controlled entity has entered into various trust and security deeds with Lloyd's in respect of assets lodged to support its underwriting activities. These deeds contain covenants that require the entity to meet financial obligations should they arise in relation to cash calls from syndicate participations. A cash call would be made first on the assets held in syndicate trust funds and would only call on funds at Lloyd's after syndicate resources were exhausted. Only if the level of these trust funds was not sufficient would a cash call result in a draw down on the letters of credit and other assets lodged with Lloyd's.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is also exposed to contingent liabilities in relation to claims litigation and regulatory examinations arising out of its insurance and reinsurance activities. The Group may also be exposed to the possibility of contingent liabilities in relation to insurance and non-insurance litigation including but not limited to regulatory test cases and class actions, taxation and compliance matters, which may result in legal or regulatory penalties and financial or non-financial losses and other impacts. QBE is currently defending a representative class action in Australia relating to policyholders with business interruption policies (refer to note 1.2.3).\n\nEntities in the Group may also provide guarantees to support representations in commercial transactions.",

Some of the assumptions used may be based on historical data which is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Reasonable changes in these assumptions would not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 8.5.4 Employee options\n\nThe market value of all shares underlying the options at the balance date was A$0.2 million (2020 A$0.1 million). During 2021, no options were cancelled or forfeited. At 31 December 2021, 17,000 remained, excluding notional dividends (2020 17,000). The options were issued to employees in 2004 in lieu of shares under the Plan. The options vested immediately and are exercisable until March 2024.\n\n## 8.5.5 Share-based payment expense\n\nThis expense, which includes amounts in relation to cash-settled share-based payment awards, was $36 million (2020 $20 million). These amounts are included in underwriting and other expenses.\n\n## 8.5.6 Shares purchased on-market\n\nThe Group may purchase shares on-market to satisfy entitlements under employee share schemes. The Group acquired 0.1 million (2020 0.2 million) such shares during the period at an average price of A$11.07 (2020 A$13.18).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity-settled instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The impacts of non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable.\n\nThe fair value of each instrument is recognised evenly over the service period ending at the vesting date; however, at each balance date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable due to the achievement of non-market vesting conditions. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\n1\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Bonus or profit sharing obligations are settled within 12 months from the balance date.\n\n## Post-employment bene/fits - de/fined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays a fixed contribution into a fund during the course of employment and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Other long-term employee employment bene/fits\n\nThe liabilities for long service leave and annual leave are recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using high quality corporate bond yields with terms and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nFurther information in relation to remuneration under equity-based compensation schemes is provided in note 8.5.\n\n## Termination bene/fits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the date when the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and\n- \u00b7 recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the payment of termination benefits.\n\nIn the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.",

Contributions are made to cover the current cash outflows from the plans and a liability is recorded to recognise the estimated accrued but not yet funded obligations.\n\n|                                                    |                                     | FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS   | FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS   | PRESENT VALUE OF   PLAN OBLIGATIONS   | PRESENT VALUE OF   PLAN OBLIGATIONS   | NET RECOGNISED SURPLUSES  (DEFICITS)   | NET RECOGNISED SURPLUSES  (DEFICITS)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|                                                    | DATE OF LAST  ACTUARIAL  ASSESSMENT | 2021  US$M                  | 2020  US$M                  | 2021  US$M                            | 2020  US$M                            | 2021  US$M                             | 2020  US$M                             |\n| Defined benefit plan surpluses                     |                                     |                             |                             |                                       |                                       |                                        |                                        |\n| Iron Trades Insurance staff trust                  | 31 Dec 2021                         | 365                         | 363                         | (285)                                 | (299)                                 | 80                                     | 64                                     |\n| Janson Green final salary  superannuation scheme 1 | 31 Dec 2021                         | 197                         | 209                         | (185)                                 | (208)                                 | 12                                     | 1                                      |\n|                                                    |                                     | 562                         | 572                         | (470)                                 | (507)                                 | 92                                     | 65                                     |\n| Defined benefit plan deficits                      |                                     |                             |                             |                                       |                                       |                                        |                                        |\n| QBE the Americas plan 1                            | 31 Dec 2021                         | 214                         | 258                         | (224)                                 | (259)                                 | (10)                                   | (1)                                    |\n| Other plans 2                                      | 31 Dec 2021                         | 34                          | 44                          | (53)                                  | (65)                                  | (19)                                   | (21)                                   |\n|                                                    |                                     | 248                         | 302                         | (277)                                 | (324)                                 | (29)                                   | (22)                                   |\n\nThe measurement of assets and liabilities in defined benefit plans makes it necessary to use assumptions about discount rates, expected future salary increases, investment returns, inflation and life expectancy. If actual outcomes differ materially from actuarial assumptions, this could result in a significant change in employee benefit expense recognised in profit or loss or in actuarial remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income, together with the defined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group does not control the investment strategies of defined benefit plans; they are managed by independent trustees. Nonetheless, the Group has agreed, as part of ongoing funding arrangements, that the trustees should manage their strategic asset allocation in order to minimise the risk of material adverse impact. In particular, the Group has agreed with the trustees to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that match, where possible, the profile of the liabilities. This involves holding a mixture of government and corporate bonds. The Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is also appropriate.\n\nThe charge recognised in profit or loss in the year of $2 million (2020 $3 million) is included in underwriting expenses. Total employer contributions expected to be paid to the various plans in 2022 amount to $1 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have a term to maturity approximating the term of the related superannuation liability. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

External tax services are generally provided by an accounting firm other than the external auditor. Consistent with prior periods, the external auditor cannot provide the excluded services of preparing accounting records or financial reports or acting in a management capacity.\n\n|                                                                         | 2021 US$000   | 2020 US$000   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Australian firm                            |               |               |\n| Audit or review of financial reports of the ultimate parent entity      | 2,022         | 1,868         |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 2,258         | 1,805         |\n| Audit of statutory returns                                              | 591           | 483           |\n| Other assurance services                                                | 515           | 920           |\n| Taxation services                                                       | 14            | 32            |\n| Advisory services                                                       | 524           | 505           |\n|                                                                         | 5,924         | 5,613         |\n| Related practices of PwC Australian firm (including overseas PwC firms) |               |               |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 9,157         | 9,654         |\n| Audit of statutory returns                                              | 2,640         | 2,824         |\n| Other assurance services                                                | 53            | 130           |\n| Taxation services                                                       | 34            | 74            |\n| Advisory services                                                       | 72            | 102           |\n|                                                                         | 11,956        | 12,784        |\n|                                                                         | 17,880        | 18,397        |\n| Audit and assurance services                                            | 17,236        | 17,684        |\n| Other services                                                          | 644           | 713           |\n|                                                                         | 17,880        | 18,397        |\n| Other auditors                                                          |               |               |\n| Audit of financial reports of controlled entities                       | 1,101         | 15            |",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial Report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 For the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of US$60 million, which represents approximately 0.5% of the Group's net earned premium.\n- \u00b7 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the Financial Report as a whole.\n- \u00b7 We chose Group net earned premium because, in our view, it is a key financial statement metric used in assessing the performance of the Group and is not as volatile as other profit or loss measures.\n- \u00b7 We utilised a 0.5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds.\n\n## Audit Scope\n\n- \u00b7 Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events. To conduct this risk assessment, we considered the inherent risks facing the Group, including those arising from its respective business operations, and how the Group manages these risks.\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with component auditors, we conducted an audit of the most financially significant components, being the Australia Pacific, International and North America divisions. In addition, we performed specified risk focused audit procedures in relation to the captive reinsurer, Equator Re, and other head office entities. Further audit procedures were performed over the consolidation process.\n- \u00b7 We determined the level of direction and supervision we needed to have over the audit work performed by component auditors to be satisfied that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained for the purposes of our opinion.\n- \u00b7 We kept in regular communication with component auditors throughout the year with conference calls and written instructions.\n- \u00b7 We also ensured that our team, including the component auditors across the Group, possessed the appropriate competence and capabilities needed for the audit of a complex global insurer. This included industry expertise as well as specialists and experts in IT, actuarial, tax and valuations.",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of net outstanding claims liability\n\n(Refer to note 2.3) $17,525 million\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims relates to claims incurred during the year or prior periods, net of any reinsurance and other recoveries.\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims is estimated by the Group as a central estimate but, as is the case with any accounting estimate, there is a risk that the ultimate claims paid will differ from the initial estimate. A risk margin is therefore applied by the Group to reflect the uncertainty in the estimate. The central estimate and risk margin combined, which are estimated based on judgements and actuarial expertise, are intended to achieve a probability of adequacy within the Group's desired range of 87.5% - 92.5%, being the estimated overall sufficiency of the liability to pay future claims.\n\nWe considered the valuation of the net outstanding claims liability a key audit matter due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The significant judgement required by the Group and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the expected future payments for claims incurred, including those not yet reported.\n- \u00b7  The uncertainty related to catastrophe events, particularly those occurring closer to year end, and in relation to classes of business where there is a greater length of time between the initial claim event and settlement, because of the inherent difficulty in assessing amounts until further evidence is available.\n- \u00b7 The uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic on particular classes of business including property business interruption, credit exposed lines and certain long-tail classes as a result of ongoing legal test cases, wider macroeconomic impacts and other factors.\n- \u00b7 Models used to calculate the net outstanding claims liability across the Group are complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the models.\n- \u00b7 The higher degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to significant assumptions, particularly patterns of claims incidence, reporting and payments.\n- \u00b7 The audit effort required the use of experts with specialised skills and knowledge.\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nTogether with PwC actuarial experts, our procedures included:\n\n## Gross discounted central estimate\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the design of the Group's relevant controls over the claims reserving process and assessing whether a sample of these controls operated effectively throughout the year.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether the Group's actuarial methodologies were consistent with recognised practices and with prior periods.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness and reliability of data used to derive the central estimate, including testing a sample of case estimates and settlement by agreeing to underlying documentation.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of significant actuarial assumptions such as patterns of claims incidence, reporting and payments, focusing on those classes of business which present a higher risk and in particular those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed these assumptions by comparing them with our expectations based on the Group's experience, current trends and benchmarks, and our own industry knowledge.\n- \u00b7 Testing the discount assumptions applied through evaluating the yield curves and claims payment patterns. This included comparing the rates applied to external market data and the payment patterns to historical information.\n\n## Reinsurance and other recoveries\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating a sample of reinsurance recoveries held by divisions and the Group against underlying contracts to assess the existence of cover and appropriateness of their recognition, including making inquiries regarding legal advice obtained by the Group.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the recoverability of reinsurance recoveries by considering the payment history and credit worthiness of reinsurer counterparties for a sample of reinsurance recoveries.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The value-in-use for each of the CGUs is estimated by the Group using a discounted cash flow model which includes significant judgements and assumptions relating to cash flow projections, investment returns, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.\n\nWe considered the carrying value of goodwill a key audit matter due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The inherent estimation uncertainty and subjectivity in judgements in a number of assumptions, including cash flow projections, investment returns, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\n- \u00b7 Models used to calculate value-in-use are complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the models.\n- \u00b7 The higher degree of auditor subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in relation to significant assumptions, particularly cash flow projections.\n- \u00b7 The audit effort required the use of experts with specialised skills and knowledge.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Risk margin and probability of adequacy\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's approach to setting the risk margin in accordance with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, with a focus on the assessed level of uncertainty in the net central estimate leading to a change in the margin year on year.\n- \u00b7 Considering the Group's key judgements about the variability of each class of business underwritten and the extent of correlation within each division based on the Group's experience and prior periods.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the Group's calculation of the probability of adequacy for reasonableness and consistency with previous valuations by developing an understanding of and testing the actuarial techniques applied by the Group.\n\nWe also considered the reasonableness of the Group's disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the determination and composition of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the value-in-use methodology adopted against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the process by which the cash flow projections were developed and comparing the cash flows included in the impairment assessment with the three year business plan presented to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used to derive the cash flow projections by comparing to external market and industry data where available, and current and past performance of the CGUs.\n- \u00b7 Together with PwC valuation experts, we:\n- - Assessed the consistency of the terminal growth rates and investment returns with available external information.\n- - Reperformed the calculation of the discount rates applied to cash flow projections, comparing key inputs (including risk-free rates, market premiums and unlevered betas) to industry and other benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models which were used to determine the value-in-use of the CGUs.\n\nWe also considered the reasonableness of the Group's disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",

It is very important that shareholders bank outstanding dividend cheques promptly and advise Computershare immediately of changes of address or bank account details.\n\n## Recent QBE dividends\n\n| DATE PAID         | TYPE    | RECORD DATE      |   AUSTRALIAN CENTS PER SHARE |   FRANKING % |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------|------------------------------|--------------|\n| 28 March 2013     | Final   | 8 March 2013     |                           10 |          100 |\n| 23 September 2013 | Interim | 2 September 2013 |                           20 |          100 |\n| 31 March 2014     | Final   | 13 March 2014    |                           12 |          100 |\n| 23 September 2014 | Interim | 29 August 2014   |                           15 |          100 |\n| 13 April 2015     | Final   | 6 March 2015     |                           22 |          100 |\n| 2 October 2015    | Interim | 28 August 2015   |                           20 |          100 |\n| 14 April 2016     | Final   | 11 March 2016    |                           30 |          100 |\n| 28 September 2016 | Interim | 26 August 2016   |                           21 |           50 |\n| 13 April 2017     | Final   | 10 March 2017    |                           33 |           50 |\n| 29 September 2017 | Interim | 25 August 2017   |                           22 |           30 |\n| 20 April 2018     | Final   | 9 March 2018     |                            4 |           30 |\n| 5 October 2018    | Interim | 24 August 2018   |                           22 |           30 |\n| 18 April 2019     | Final   | 8 March 2019     |                           28 |           60 |\n| 4 October 2019    | Interim | 23 August 2019   |                           25 |           60 |\n| 9 April 2020      | Final   | 6 March 2020     |                           27 |           30 |\n| 25 September 2020 | Interim | 21 August 2020   |                            4 |           10 |\n| 24 September 2021 | Interim | 20 August 2021   |                           11 |           10 |\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of QBE Insurance Group Limited will be held at 10am on Thursday, 5 May 2022.
