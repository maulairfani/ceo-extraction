All of our colleagues can be very proud of their achievements during the year.\n\n## Optimism for the future\n\nThe defining backdrop to 2021 was the continuation, and evolution, of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the associated economic uncertainties. Our colleagues have continued to work hard, adapting well to the mixed home/office environment, while also confronting the dreadful reality of the various COVID-19 waves, such as we saw in India in Q1 2021. Ensuring compliance with government guidance has been a priority, and of course the rules have varied from location to location. Barclays has tried to be as flexible as possible, recognising that there are colleagues nervous of a return to crowded transportation just as much as there are those who feel better by being in the office.\n\nWe hope to settle into a clearer working pattern in 2022 and fully expect that to encompass a greater degree of choice and flexibility than in the past, a welcome development. Consistent with our Purpose, 'to deploy finance responsibly to support people and businesses', we expect to be able to adjust the nature of work in such a way that it enhances our ability to serve customers and clients properly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nThis performance was in no small way a credit to Jes Staley, who left Barclays as Chief Executive towards the end of the year, and the team he assembled. It is obviously not appropriate for me to comment at the moment, further than has been done already, on the circumstances of Jes's departure. It is important to let the regulatory and related processes take their course and, at the time of writing this letter, they have not completed. It is appropriate, however, to recognise that under the leadership of Jes, Barclays established a clear strategy, built up a secure capital base, improved its operational resilience and developed its businessleading franchises. We are therefore grateful for the hard work that he put in for the Company.\n\nWhile the Group benefited from extraordinary levels of activity in Investment Banking and Global Markets during the COVID-19 pandemic, it also faced declines in consumer spending and card balances. The welcome policy responses of governments to the pandemic brought considerable relief to individuals, households and companies, as well as a prolongation, at least until recently, of the low interest rate environment.  All in all, colleagues should be very pleased with the strong results this year and the high degree of capital and operational resilience achieved against this backdrop. We are also pleased to have been able to distribute returns, through a resumption of dividends and a commencement of share buy-backs, to our shareholders. Their understanding and support during the current health and economic crisis has been much appreciated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a consequence of having an effective succession plan in place, the Board had no hesitation about asking CS Venkatakrishnan (known as Venkat) to take on the leadership of the Company. Venkat has been with Barclays for six years, first as Chief Risk Officer and latterly, and in anticipation of succeeding Jes Staley in due course, running Global Markets. The Board is confident that Venkat will be a great leader of the business.\n\n.\n\nTushar Morzaria has informed the Board of his intention to retire and the Board is delighted to have, in Anna Cross, such a strong internal successor. Anna was identified over a year ago as the Board's preferred successor, following a review of potential internal and external candidates. Tushar has been an outstanding Finance Director and colleague, as well as playing broader roles inside and outside Barclays; the Board is both grateful for his immense hard work and delighted that he will have a continuing role with Barclays.\n\n' Colleagues should be very pleased with the strong results this year and the high degree of capital and operational resilience achieved against this backdrop.\n\ncla",

This is a major opportunity to make financial services faster, more accessible and cheaper for people. At the same time, there is a large number of people who really benefit from personal interaction, and under some definitions, over half of the UK population will be classified as 'vulnerable' in one way or another in their lifetime. It is central to Barclays' strategy that we adjust our footprint without neglecting the needs of society. We are one of the driving forces behind the current initiatives to share bank infrastructure across the major banks and thereby provide physically present services to communities that can no longer support one individual bank branch, let alone several. We are very conscious of the important part we play in providing banking services for people everywhere. While we may close branches we will not be cutting off those communities and remain committed to the provision of basic banking services.\n\n2022 will also be a challenging year, albeit mainly for different reasons compared to 2021. In Venkat's letter to shareholders he paints a picture around three major themes which will shape much of Barclays' evolution the opportunities and threats of digitisation, the continuing growth of the public and private global capital markets and the overarching importance of our environmental and other societal responsibilities. The Group's strategy will be largely unchanged but, building on the strengths that he has inherited, I am sure that Venkat, with the rest of the management team, will ensure that its implementation rigorously focuses on the impact of these three material themes. They all bring challenges and choices. Perhaps I can illustrate this in a couple of cases, each of which has enjoyed considerable focus by the Board through the year.\n\nBar\n\ncla\n\ny\n\nI believe that our commitment to society as a whole is well reinforced by our community and charitable activities. Going forward these will more clearly focus on unlocking both skills and employment, especially for historically under-represented groups, and sustainable growth for young businesses in particular. To take one example, our LifeSkills programme has now reached more than 15 million people and we aim to reach 2 million more in 2022. Another example is the \u00a3100m COVID-19 Community Aid Package launched in the first few months of the pandemic. This has now supported more than 370 charity partners around the world, including in India at the height of the Delta variant, getting much needed food, hygiene and PPE kits to those in need.\n\nOur work to do more to embrace the Race at Work agenda has also made progress. This year, we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling the number of Black Managing Directors working for Barclays, although we must be frank with ourselves that we are building from a low base in this regard. We aim to increase the number of under-represented minority employees by 25% in the UK and 20% in the US by the end of 2025. We recognise we have much further to go before our workforce can become properly reflective of the world we live in.\n\nI would like to end by thanking all my Board colleagues for their contributions this last year. The Board has responded well to the issues we have faced. We welcomed Julia Wilson in April 2021 and Robert Berry in February 2022. We go forward in 2022 with a new Chief Executive and Finance Director and I am as optimistic for the future stewardship of the Company as I am grateful for the contribution of those who held office before them.\n\n## Thank you\n\nNigel Higgins Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We go forward in 2022 with a new Chief Executive and Finance Director and I am as optimistic for the future stewardship of the Company as I am grateful for the contribution of those who held office before them.\n\nThere are important issues ahead on the environment as well. Barclays remains focused on its net zero ambition and committed to Paris alignment across all of its financing activities. At the same time, we firmly believe in supporting transition and ensuring that those companies that are committed to a Paris journey receive the financing they need in order to fund that business and environmental shift. This shift will not be achieved by driving the banks out of financing all major energy and power companies but by recognising the complexity of the energy transition and continuing to work with market participants on shifting both supply and demand to accelerate an orderly and just transition. The wrong response could push ownership and financing away from responsible stewards of those assets and activities. It is a measure of the weight we attach to the wider ESG framework that we have integrated our ESG report into this year's Annual Report; ESG is no 'add-on' and it should be at the heart of any company's strategy and operations. Our Purpose statement deliberately stresses 'for the common good and the long term' and we believe that the actions we are taking are a responsible long-term approach to the climate crisis.",

Each brings challenge and opportunity for Barclays. It is essential that our strategy reflects these challenges and opportunities, and that we adapt and innovate to grow\n\nIt is a great honour to be the Chief Executive of Barclays.\n\nIn this brief letter, I will address our recent financial performance, the current business and operating climate, and how we aim to adapt and grow our products and services, particularly digitally, to meet the needs of our customers.  It is a statement of strategy and approach, paying close heed to our role in society.\n\nI am deeply conscious that I succeed a three-century long line of stewards of this Company. It is my turn, with this generation of colleagues, to provide the Group with the financial strength and business capability for continued prosperity.\n\n## A Universal bank, based in Britain\n\nGroup Profit Before Tax for 2021 is \u00a38.4bn and Group Return on Tangible Equity for the year is 13.4%, with both our operating divisions - Barclays UK and Barclays International - delivering double-digit returns. We also remain highly capitalised, with a CET1 ratio of 15.1% as at year end.\n\nWe are a British bank with a universal model, offering a range of services to clients worldwide.  We are a large consumer bank, managing an excellent credit card franchise, a leading corporate bank, and one of the largest global investment banks. Each is a successful business in its own right, but together they comprise a resilient and balanced Group, which has delivered record levels of profitability in 2021.\n\nGiven this strength, we have been able to announce a return of over \u00a32.5bn of excess capital to shareholders for 2021, comprising a dividend of 6p per share and \u00a31.5bn in share buy-backs. This is equivalent to a total payout of 15p per share. Continuing to return capital to shareholders remains an important priority and, as we end the year with a CET1 ratio above 15%, I am confident in our ongoing ability to do so.\n\nOver the last five years, Barclays' share price has declined by 16%, but this is less than the 26% decline in the FTSE 350 UK Bank Index over the same timeframe. In stark contrast, we have meaningfully underperformed our US peers, who are up 66% on a combined basis over the same period. This underscores the necessity of producing steadily improving financial performance, maintaining commitment to our business model and clients, explaining it well to our investors and overcoming the particular challenges of our local economic circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur performance over the last two years, certainly compared to UK banks, is evidence that the universal bank strategy has provided strength and stability. I am grateful to my predecessor, Jes Staley, and to our Group Finance Director, Tushar Morzaria, for forging this path. I have no doubt that this diversified model will remain the bedrock of our success for many years.\n\nI would also take this opportunity to acknowledge Tushar Morzaria's enormous contribution to Barclays over the past 8 years, and to thank him personally for this and for his support. I am delighted that Tushar will continue with Barclays as Chairman of Global Financial Institutions Group in our Investment Bank. Our clients will be able to benefit further from his deep knowledge\n\n' Banking is undergoing a deep transformation driven by three major forces of change: technology, the growth of capital markets, and climate transition.

I strongly endorse the appointment of Anna Cross as Group Finance Director and am delighted that the Board has asked her to succeed Tushar. I look forward to working closely with Anna as we continue to deliver our strategy.\n\nBar\n\ncla\n\ny\n\nOur diversification has been an essential feature of the resilience of the Group through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, strong profitability in our Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) helped us withstand a severe downturn in our consumer businesses. This year, the robust performance of the CIB continued while our consumer businesses also recovered, in line with the broader economy.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's introduction and market overview continued\n\n## Winds of change, and opportunity\n\nBanking is undergoing a deep transformation driven by three important forces of change: technology, the growth of the public and private capital markets, and the climate transition. Each brings challenge and opportunity for Barclays.\n\nThe universal banking model informs the collection of businesses in which we engage - wholesale and consumer; trading and lending; payments and cards. However, it does not tell us how to run each business to its full potential and over time.\n\n- 1.  Next-generation consumer financial services Digitisation has liberated finance, providing our customers and clients with an explosion of cheaper and better products and services, and a more seamless and efficient user experience. This applies equally in wholesale and consumer finance, but is more easily observed in the transformation that has taken place in retail financial services over the last 20 years. Today, I deposit, withdraw, pay, and transfer funds, domestically and internationally, at any time day, anywhere, on a phone.  This is a very different world from the 1970's in India, when I first opened a bank account.\n\nOur challenge and opportunity is to provide customers with equal, and possibly better, convenience and functionality than they receive from these firms. On the one hand, I am gratified with the progress already made on this journey - over the last decade, we have given millions of customers the power to open accounts, identify themselves electronically and securely, access products, view digital receipts and earn loyalty points, all in the palm of their hand, day and night.\n\nNothing exemplifies these changes better than the growth of newer, non-bank, entities. Today, the market capitalisation of the largest UK banks and the major non-bank financial technology firms (Fintechs) operating in the UK is roughly the same, around \u00a3250bn. 20 years ago the latter group barely existed.\n\nOn the other hand, the road ahead is long and steep.\n\nWe have collaborated with the world's largest retailer, Amazon, to bring a digital BNPL product to users in Germany and the UK. We provide customers with accessible financing, backed by the consumer protection and trustworthiness of engaging with a regulated lender. This exemplifies for me how we should be operating: innovation, founded in trust and responsibility.\n\nWe must continue to advance technology, of course, but we must also have an innovative mindset to bring to market new products and services, just as the pioneers of Barclaycard did in the past. To take one example, 'Buy Now Pay Later' (BNPL) allows customers to split purchases into smaller payments, or to defer them. The concept is not new - shopkeepers have been offering their customers credit for hundreds of years but the implementation is innovative and represents a different lending product alongside credit cards and personal loans.\n\nDigitisation of finance has also created new forms of old dangers. Financial scams are a growing menace for banks and for customers, with criminals exploiting the ease with which funds may be accessed and transferred. This threat requires much greater cooperation between business, legislators and regulators to increase customer education and improve their protections.  Barclays is committed to help lead that new approach.\n\nThe dominant business challenge for the next decade will be to continue to transform our Company to deliver services digitally, with ease, flexibility and adaptability. This will get harder as we compete not just with other banks for talent and ideas, but with well-funded, superbly equipped and lightly regulated - therefore more fleet-footed - technology firms that attract the brightest graduates from top universities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Facts and figures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' We must provide the same ease and flexibility for our customers that they get from technology firms, and invest not only to keep pace but to stay ahead.\n\nIndeed, as technology continues to transform consumer financial services, so too are our businesses changing. Across Barclays UK and Consumer, Cards and Payments, we will continue to invest heavily in our digital capabilities as a means of delivering better products and services, more efficiently, and with higher profitability. Indeed, we expect our investment in payment capabilities to yield an additional \u00a3900m of income between 2020 and 2023.",

Growth of the public and private global capital markets\n\nThe value of our franchise depends on the growth and health of the global capital markets. These are the venues - increasingly electronic - where companies, institutions and governments issue securities, underwritten by banks, and where they are traded. Combining the total market capitalisation of those securities around the world, we have seen roughly 50% growth in the value of equities and bonds outstanding over the last four years alone, increasing from $123trn in 2018 to over $193trn today b .\n\nBarclays is the sixth-largest global investment bank a , and the largest not domiciled in the US. Our relative position has improved in the last five years as other European banks have exited from some or all of this business. In Investment Banking, we rank sixth globally, up from seventh last year, while our Global Markets business maintained its sixth place for global revenue, up from seventh in 2018. The capital, infrastructure, talent and regulatory requirements of being a global investment bank have steadily increased since the financial crisis. It is therefore a competitive strength for us that we are one of the few firms that can afford to offer these services and also be successful at it.\n\nThe capital markets business is cyclical and can be volatile. The cyclicality can be a blessing, as demonstrated in recent years when performance in Investment Banking and Global Markets helped offset a downturn in the consumer banking cycle. Equally, our business requires scale to sustain earnings in weaker times, and versatility to adapt to them. I am happy to report that, through 2021, we have been able to grow our revenues across Investment Banking fees and Equities d . Our performance has benefited, not just from higher market activity, but because of a steady accumulation of talented traders and bankers, investment in systems and technology, and a\n\n' The value of our franchise depends on the growth and health of the global capital markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the public markets have grown, so too have the private ones, at a greater pace. Since 2018, the total assets under management in the private markets have grown 65%, from $6.0trn to $9.8trn c . The largest Private Equity and Credit funds dominate the list of asset managers by size and profitability. They are now among our biggest clients, requiring innovative financial structures to support their own sophisticated needs. We help them devise their transactions, identify assets to purchase and sell, connect them to counterparts with whom they transact, provide financing to support their trades, and investments to employ their proceeds.\n\nconsistent commitment to Investment Banking after a period of wavering a decade ago. Building on our culture of innovation and quality, we want to sustain and grow our market share, to protect earnings even during weaker periods in the cycle.\n\nAs in the consumer business, broad technological prowess is essential to competing effectively in the Corporate and Investment Bank. We want to be a best-in-class electronic bank to our Global Markets clients. We will continue to expand in Prime Financing, to grow our share in Securitised Products and take our Investment Banking strength into new economy sectors like Technology and Healthcare. In the Corporate Bank, we want to diversify our revenue by growing our market share in Europe and the US, and by growing Transaction Banking.\n\nVolatility is an ever-present opportunity and risk. Our trading businesses transact in, and lend against, vast amounts of securities, of different types and varying credit quality. These are denominated in many currencies, and sometimes have great structural complexity. We engage with a variety of counterparts, from governments, to corporations to private investment vehicles. This activity yields considerable financial reward, but is subject to market price uncertainty, counterparty weakness and operational imperfections. Barclays invests deeply in the systems, controls and culture to protect against large or surprising losses. These controls have protected us in the last many years, but we remain ever vigilant.\n\n## 3.  Transition to the low-carbon economy\n\nMost forms of technological innovation, particularly after the industrial revolution, have been driven by the urge to hasten travel and communication, to automate and mass-produce, to make life more comfortable, efficient and healthy, and in the internet-era, to connect, compute and to disseminate.  However, we may now be on the threshold of an era of innovation that aims to halt and negate the deleterious effects on our planet of previous inventions. This is the drive to net zero, limiting the use of fossil fuels, emphasising renewable energy and reversing the post-industrial growth in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFinancial firms have a central role to play in this transition, providing credit and intermediating investment. We are unlikely to create new green technologies ourselves, but we can help channel resources into them, and transmit market-based incentives for individuals and companies to change, and penalties for resistance.  The scale of the investment needed is vast, estimated to be between $3-5trn per year over the next 30 years e .\n\nBarclays must have a constructive role in managing the transition. As this fundamental re-organisation of the global economy takes place, affecting every business in every sector, we want to capture opportunity for our Company in meeting the demand for climate change related financing. That means being the trusted partner for our customers and clients as they transition, advising and supporting as they adapt their business models and lifestyles to become more sustainable. It requires us to use our investment banking and capital markets expertise to help build low-carbon energy capacity, including facilitating \u00a3100bn of green finance by 2030. It necessitates developing banking products that help consumers and small businesses make greener choices, and it requires investing our own equity capital in the young companies that are inventing the low-carbon emission technologies of tomorrow.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Bonds represent debt issuance outstanding for Investment Grade (Source: Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index LEGATRUU) and high yield (Source: Bloomberg Barclays Global High Yield Index LG30TRUU) Equities source:  Bloomberg WCAUWRLD Index representing the market capitalisation from all shares outstanding\n- a Top 6 Global Investment Bank supported by #6 ranking in Investment Banking (Source : Dealogic) and #6 ranking in Global Markets (Source : Coalition Greenwich, FY21 Preliminary Competitor analysis.\n- c Source: Preqin 'Future of Alternatives 2025' data excluding Hedge Funds, period covering 2018 - H121.\n- e  $3-5trn as estimated in the GFMA/BCG (Global Financial Markets Association/Boston Consulting Group) Climate Finance Markets and the Real Economy report, December 2020\n- d   On a comparable basis, period covering 2014 - 2021.

We know we must reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases per capita without undermining the ambition of developing countries to improve their standards of living. We need to curtail, and eventually eliminate, use of the most polluting fossil fuels, without creating energy shortages amid growing global demand for power. We must also answer questions about how to support the best and most innovative new technologies, and how to encourage individuals to adopt them. Lastly, we must have a robust approach to assessing and managing our own financial exposure to climate change risk.\n\nWe pursue our business priorities conscious that we are in more than usually uncertain times. The pandemic has deeply affected global economic activity, depressing some sectors and boosting others, requiring vast amounts of government monetary and fiscal stimulus to support employment and fight inequality, and leading to levels of capital markets activity and volatility seen rarely in a generation. Perhaps most notably, we have seen a rise in both UK and US inflation to heights not seen since the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n## The economic environment\n\nAs we look to the future, we know that a new generation of our citizens will have to learn to invest and save in a manner that their parents have typically not done, while a new class of political and economic leaders may have to use tools that have long lain dormant in their institutions. Risks of rapid change in economic performance, and sentiment are high during changes in the economic cycle, and they can be amplified by the inescapable corrections to policy formulation and implementation. The economic cycle is changing at the same time as a shifting geo-political environment, with re-aligning super-power balances and trade and economic tensions heightened by the pandemic. Countries are having to make difficult choices relating to trade protection, addressing income inequality, managing climate change, and funding defence.\n\nBar\n\ncla\n\ny\n\nThe banking business, both wholesale and retail, is inexorably tied to these trends. As we pursue our strategic priorities to sustain and grow our Company, we will also need to be mindful of the external landscape in which we are operating. The decisions about investment and expansion must be aligned to our Purpose, and in the areas where we see the highest, and safest, expectation of reward.\n\nThe experience of the pandemic underlined the importance of finance to society. As a tool used sensitively and sincerely to support individuals and business, it has been an anchor for economic and social stability.\n\n## Supporting inclusive growth\n\nI believe strongly in the role of a bank like Barclays to support inclusion in all its forms. Inclusion fosters political and social stability; it facilitates equitable economic growth; it nurtures talent and discovers potential; it makes us care for the vulnerable; it reduces inequality; it realises the contribution - financial, social, creative, intellectual, cultural - of all of our citizens; and it creates common bonds and understanding between individuals and groups, the very essence of society.\n\nIn the move to digitise finance, we must make provision for those who are not using technology to access services. That includes access to banking and cash in the UK, where our active participation has helped the Cash Action Group create shared solutions to this social challenge. Financial inclusion, from the cradle to the grave, is built on a strong foundation of education, which we are already supporting with our ground-breaking programmes, like LifeSkills. As we go through the transition to a low-carbon economy, we need to help people and businesses finance the expensive adjustment to fuel-efficient products and services. And, of course, there is a need for our economic to confront the old challenge of regional and racial inequalities.\n\nAs we look forward, there remains a continuing need for Barclays to support inclusion in all its forms, educating and employing the disadvantaged, improving financial literacy, protecting the vulnerable from financial exploitation, and sustaining the economic life of the societies we serve.\n\n## Thank you\n\nThe principles of our Quaker founders in 1690 included integrity, community and stewardship. Our own stewardship of Barclays seeks to remain faithful to that ethos.\n\nNone of the success we achieved this year could have taken place without the dedicated effort of colleagues all across the organisation. Culture is important, and having the right culture, aligned to our Purpose and our Mindset is critical to delivering a sustainable performance for our customers and clients,\n\n## C. S.

Our Section 172(1) statement provides details of how the Directors have engaged with and had regard to the interests of our key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details of the Key Activities of the Board in 2021, refer to our Governance Report on pages 120 to 123.\n\n## How does the Board engage with stakeholders?\n\nAs a result of its direct interactions and discussion of the reports and information received, the Board has an overview of engagement with stakeholders, and other relevant factors, which enables the Directors to comply with their legal duty under Section 172(1). In doing so, the Board has to balance different and, sometimes, competing perspectives which means that it is not always possible to deliver everyone's desired outcome or necessarily achieve a positive outcome for all stakeholders.\n\nThe relevance of each stakeholder group may differ depending on the particular decision the Board is taking, as may the method of engagement used by the Board. The Board engages directly with stakeholders on certain issues, but the number and distribution of the Group's stakeholders and the size of Barclays overall means that stakeholder engagement often takes place at an operational level.  The Board also receives regular reports from individual business areas and from key Group functions through reports sent in advance of each Board meeting and through in-person or video-conference presentations. This assists the Board to understand the impact of the Group's operations on, and the interests and views of, the Group's key stakeholders.\n\nYou can find out more about how Barclays engages with its priority stakeholders on the previous pages.\n\n## Engagement in action: Evolving our Strategy\n\nYou will find below further details of how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in Section 172 when discharging their duties, and the effect of those considerations in reaching certain decisions taken by them, in the context of how during 2021 the Board approved some key elements of the Group's strategic priorities to sustain and grow our business.\n\nIt is the Board's responsibility to establish the Company's strategy. Given its fundamental importance, the Directors considered matters relevant to both the Company's and the wider Group's strategy at every scheduled Board meeting in 2021. As noted in the Chairman's letter, our strategy is aligned to the themes which the Board considers will shape much of the Group's evolution - the opportunities and threats of digitisation, the continuing growth of the capital markets, and the overarching importance of our environmental and other societal responsibilities. Each of these areas has been discussed in detail by the Board with senior management. The Board strongly believes that it is important to have regard to the views of our key stakeholder groups as we evolve our strategy.",

It also accelerated a number of existing trends in customer and client behaviour which we have seen continue during 2021, including in the context of the number of transactions undertaken by our customers and clients which do not require a physical branch visit or in person engagement. Together with a continued significant shift towards digital adoption and demand for digital financial services to meet day-to-day needs, this has further accelerated our digital agenda and our focus on creating new business models built around digital customer and client engagement. Against this background, as set out in further detail in the Group Chief Executive's Review, one of our core priorities is to deliver next-generation, digitised consumer financial services to ensure we remain competitive and continue to meet the needs of our customers and clients, while maintaining our societal commitment to provide access to banking. Further details of this can be found on pages 11 and 62.\n\n- \u25a0 engaging with management on the evolution of our UK business, including to ensure customer interests remain at the centre of our plans\n\nIn overseeing the evolution of this core priority, the Board has sought to ensure, and satisfy itself, that the views of a range of stakeholders have been taken into account as well as maintaining oversight of how the strategy is implemented within Barclays, including:\n\n- \u25a0 reviewing the investment priorities of the Group to ensure that they support the further digitisation of our consumer businesses\n- \u25a0 since his appointment as Group Chief Executive, Venkat spending time engaging closely with colleagues in Barclays Bank UK PLC, and our Consumer, Cards and Payments business, looking at how we are evolving our retail bank and building next-generation products and services\n- \u25a0 discussing the importance of resiliency of our technology platforms, which continues to be an area of focus for our regulators and for the Group as we further digitise our engagement with our customers and clients.\n- \u25a0 considering a broad range of financial and non-financial measures such as the Net Promoter Score where we have seen an improvement in the US Consumer Bank scores with respect to our digital servicing model\n\nTo ensure we deliver sustainable long-term returns for our investors, the Board and management have discussed throughout the year the importance of operating a service model which is responsive to evolving customer and client expectations and which enables Barclays to remain competitive. In this context, during 2021 the Board has spent time reviewing and considering customer and client insight analysis - including hearing from management the views of customers and clients at Board meetings on areas such as access to cash and to basic banking services and support and the importance of ensuring customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, can continue to readily access help. These discussions have helped the Board to ensure that as we evolve our consumer businesses and take on new partnerships in our Consumer, Cards and Payments business, our strategy puts meeting the needs of our customers and clients at the centre. This is  done in a way which actively considers areas of potential conduct and execution risk as we leverage technology developments and digital engagement channels as a means of making things simpler, more transparent and more secure for our customers and clients.\n\nBarclays has also continued to play an important role in using technology and our monitoring capabilities to help address fraud and has engaged with its wider stakeholder group, including the government, in regard to online safety and financial scams. Read more about our investments in security systems that protect against fraud and scams on page 63.\n\nThe Board recognises that success over the long term is tied inextricably to the progress of our communities and we are committed to investing in the communities in which we live, work and serve.\n\nKey to successful delivery of this priority  will be creating the workforce of the future. We are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse and inclusive workforce embedding key skills (such as digital and technology) and capabilities needed to succeed. The Board has sought and listened to the views of colleagues, through direct engagement at Board meetings, comprehensive reporting of the results from Your View and Here to Listen surveys,  attendance at leadership events and roadshows. The Board also held  dedicated discussions on matters including talent and development, wellbeing and the new hybrid way of working arrangements and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Barclays' colleagues (such as the additional support provided in India at the start of 2021). More detail on our work across all pillars of the diversity and inclusion agenda is set out in our Diversity & Inclusion Report.\n\nThe Board will continue to oversee our evolving consumer businesses as this priority is driven forwards, ensuring we maintain focus on meeting consumer demand and responding to changing behaviour while at the same time ensuring the Group becomes more efficient in its operations.",

This formed the basis of our strategy through 2021 and, as noted on the previous pages, remains consistent for 2022.\n\nIn developing the strategy for the CIB, the Board has taken into account the views of a wide range of stakeholders, considering in Board discussions matters including the contribution the business makes to the Group's returns, feedback from our shareholders on ensuring the CIB is right-sized in the context of the Group to deliver sustainable returns, and from a colleague perspective ensuring support for the growth and investment plans of the business. During 2021, our Directors met with a number of customers and clients to discuss our strategy to deliver sustainable growth in the CIB. Most notably:\n\nThe Board continues to believe that the diversification of the Group's business model is a core strength and has also been an essential feature of the resilience of the Group through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As such, delivering sustainable growth in the CIB, within the Board-approved risk appetite, is one of the key priorities set by the Board. Further details of our strategy for the CIB can be found on page 11.\n\n- \u25a0 our Chairman held strategically focused meetings and events on this topic with a range of our largest global CIB customers and clients during 2021\n- \u25a0 our Group Chief Executive was involved in key client pitches which assisted in securing new client business, including one of the largest IPOs within the Financial Institutions Group in 2021\n- \u25a0 our Group Chief Executive participated in a significant number of direct client meetings with a strong focus on discussing the growth of our CIB businesses, with Venkat recently hosting a number of C-Suite level meetings with key Barclays India clients.\n- \u25a0 deliver financial support to help our clients transition their businesses to the low-carbon economy\n\nMindful of Barclays' ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and as part of the evolution of Barclays' climate strategy, the Board has also overseen the development of CIB's strategy to both:\n\n- \u25a0 develop green and sustainable banking products, including bonds, loans and investment funds.\n\nAs well as meeting with clients and customers directly, which allows the Board to hear their views, the Board also analyses a broad range of financial and nonfinancial measures.\n\nYou can read more about our climate strategy on pages 35 to 37.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board received an update on the performance of Barclays International, including the CIB at every Board meeting. This covered engagement with clients and key transactions, as well as financial metrics which form an important component of the Group's results. In September and November, the Board held detailed strategy discussions on the CIB, particularly looking at significant trends impacting banking over the medium to long term and considering the implications for both Barclays and the wider industry. The Board considered the optimum geographical scope of the activities, products and scale of these important businesses and the investment required to support this, in particular from a technology and people perspective.\n\nThe Board has overseen the development of a robust investment plan which is reflected in the Group's Board-approved Medium Term Plan. This works to ensure that the level of investment to support the delivery of consistent and sustainable returns, including in relation to the technology investment which is key to our operational resiliency, matched Barclays' ambitions in this important area of the business. The Board has carefully monitored the governance and risk management framework for the CIB to ensure that growth opportunities are subject to appropriate controls, in line with risk appetite and sustainable. The Board also considered key conduct and customer elements of the strategy which supported effective risk management and oversight.\n\n- \u25a0 market positioning and market share opportunities presented through the strengthened performance of the CIB\n\nDuring the course of 2021, the Board and senior management met with investors to ratify the strategy and discuss Barclays' performance, and notably the benefits of the diversified model. The strength of the CIB through 2020 continued into 2021, enabling constructive engagement with investors on the strategic opportunities available to Barclays. Throughout the year, representatives of the Board, senior executives and Investor Relations held discussions with investors focused around:\n\n- \u25a0 the expansion of our client base, and therefore the additional services and geographies to complement the current offerings\n\nThe feedback from these informative discussions helped to inform the strategic considerations discussed at the Board meetings in September and November.\n\n- \u25a0 discussions on the appropriate level of risk appetite for both investors, and for Barclays as a whole.",

Further details of this strategic priority, capturing opportunities as we transition to a low-carbon economy, can be found on page 11, and on pages 35 to 37.\n\nWithin this context, the Board is focused on the delivery of this ambition, while at the same time capturing new opportunities to deepen client relationships during the transition and new growth opportunities for Barclays' business.

The requisitioned resolution was not passed by shareholders, and the AGM itself provided a further opportunity to engage with all shareholders on our climate strategy. The Board\n\nparticularly valued the opportunity that the AGM afforded to hear from our retail shareholders.

Ahead of COP26, in October 2021, Barclays participated in the UK Government's Global Investment Summit with the Group Chief Executive addressing attendees about the scale of the investment required to address the climate challenge and the critical role that financial institutions have to play in directing that investment.\n\nFrom a customer and client point of view, the Board reiterated its support for helping customers and clients execute their sustainability strategies, including de-carbonising their business models. For Barclays, support for customers and clients will include:\n\nThe Executive Directors engage with colleagues on a regular basis through a range of colleague engagement forums and colleagues are kept abreast of Barclays' ambitions and actions in relation to climate strategy through regular updates.\n\n- \u25a0 advising clients as they adapt their business models to make them more sustainable\n- \u25a0 continuing to develop innovative green and sustainable banking products such as Green Mortgages that help consumers and small businesses make their own individual transitions\n- \u25a0 using our investment banking and capital markets expertise to help build low-carbon energy capacity, through facilitating green finance against our target of \u00a3100bn by 2030\n- \u25a0 our Sustainable Impact Capital Initiative: investing up to \u00a3175m of our own capital in innovative companies that are developing the green technologies of tomorrow.\n\nOver the course of 2021 through our Board, senior management and Investor Relations team we met over 70% of our institutional shareholders by share ownership to discuss Barclays' climate strategy and understand their views.\n\nProgress will continue to be made in the coming months and beyond, with the recent introduction of the Barclays Climate and Sustainable Finance Council (to be chaired by the Group Chief Executive). This Council will help to identify, accelerate and promote the development of Barclays' climate and sustainable finance growth opportunities for the benefit of our customers and clients across all our businesses, products and services.\n\nDuring the year, the Board reviewed the Group's climate strategy as a whole, including its further evolution, progress made to date and future focus areas. The feedback the Board has received from stakeholders about our policies and their expectations with respect to our climate strategy, together with evolving industry trends and public discourse on net zero, helped to inform the Board's review.\n\nReflecting the level of importance which Barclays and its stakeholders place on the issue of climate and Barclays' role in supporting a transition to a low-carbon economy, the 2021 AGM saw the announcement by the Chairman of a 'Say on Climate' vote to be put to shareholders at our 2022 AGM. Further details will be set out in our 2022 Notice of AGM.",

Where traditional branches may have been the most appropriate point of engagement in the past, we will increase the range of more flexible options for our customers; while ensuring we continue to support customers who are less digitally capable. This will continue to include physical branches, complemented with flexible banking pop-ups in community spaces and the introduction of mobile banking vans. We will continue to play a leading role collaborating with the Access to Cash Group and plans are underway to help retailers supply cashback without purchases, ensuring greater accessibility of cash in local and remote areas.\n\nOur aim remains putting customers and clients at the heart of the decisions we make, helping to ensure good customer outcomes for every customer and client. We are endeavouring to reinvent our service model for customers, creating a more efficient, more resilient and seamless service at a pace that suits our customers' expectations.\n\nWe continue to build partnerships in the open market and work across Barclays to deliver additional value for our customers and businesses through our size and scale. We will continue to invest in digital platforms, remove unnecessary processes and costs and make it seamless for customers to self-serve.\n\nWe are acutely aware of increasing consumer expectations on climate and sustainability. We are committed to inspiring and supporting our customers to live and act more sustainably through our propositions. We're developing a consumer-focused Sustainability Hub, bringing together insights, resources and information about Green products and how Barclays can support them in making the transition to a more sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information go online at home.barclays\n\ncla",

We leveraged the investments made in our data science platform by producing  more than 300 reports tied to our data-science insights in 2021. We also played a critical role in driving our thought leadership, for example with the launch of the Eagle Eye newsletter and the ongoing Flip Side podcast to our clients.\n- \u25a0 We continued to invest in our Investment Banking coverage of high growth sectors, including expanding our Sustainable Impact Banking (SIB) Group. SIB advised on or raised capital for companies in over 50 transactions representing over \u00a318bn, a five-fold increase in  financing volumes from 2020 and a more than doubling in the number of strategic advisory transactions for clients whose businesses are addressing environmental or social challenge.\n- \u25a0 Our Corporate Banking business acted as a major provider of green and sustainable lending, and continued developing our sustainable product set, growing the number of products from 6 in 2020 to 15 in 2021, including trade, lending and deposits. We collaborated across CIB to deliver financial support to help our clients meet their crucial ESG targets.\n- \u25a0 Our Corporate Banking business continued to play a role in supporting clients impacted by COVID-19 through the UK Government lending schemes as well as supporting businesses to accelerate growth with the introduction of the new General Export Facility (GEF) in collaboration with UK Export Finance. Since GEF was made available, Barclays has approved more than \u00a395m of UK Export Finance backed finance accounting for over 40% of the total value of facilities to date. In the UK, Corporate Banking deposit balances grew by 7% during the year.\n- \u25a0 We continued monetising our investments in our international footprint of our Corporate Banking business. Despite the challenging environment, we on-boarded nearly 600 new clients across nine EU countries where our Transaction Banking offering is now live.\n\nAcross our Corporate and Investment Bank, we will remain focused on maintaining our client-centric approach and developing opportunities to grow our business and increase returns.

Our focus will remain on steadily improving our credit portfolio returns by reallocating risk weighted assets to higher-returning opportunities. We will keep investing in our trade, payments and wholesale lending offering and we will look to further enhance our digital proposition.\n\nInvestment Banking will continue its investment in high-priority sectors, particularly in Healthcare, where we have more to do to improve fee share, and in Technology in the US and Europe. More broadly, we aim to build on our established momentum and improve revenue contribution from our equity and advisory offerings.

In Payments, we also saw a continuing trend towards e-commerce versus in-store transactions, with an accelerating number of SMEs in particular pivoting their businesses online and accepting digital payments.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and low interest rate environment continued to have a significant impact on Consumer, Cards and Payments. It accelerated a number of existing trends in customer behaviour, including consumers saving more and paying down existing debt.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\n- \u25a0 Responding to changing consumer behaviour: We continue to invest in the digitisation of our businesses, delivering new products and capabilities to reflect growing trends. This includes focusing on scaling our existing e-commerce solutions to add further value to our digitally engaged customers, small businesses and corporates.\n\nWe  strive to deliver next-generation consumer financial services, offering best-in-class finance, private banking and payment solutions.\n\n- \u25a0 Building a more efficient and seamless business: We are accelerating our automation agenda to drive operational efficiency and create a more seamless digital customer experience.\n- \u25a0 Winning new partnerships: We are focused on broadening relationships with our existing partners and pursuing new partnerships, particularly in the US.

We know that the past two years have been challenging for a lot of our people, in different ways, impacting both our personal and professional lives. We are proud of the way colleagues responded to these challenges, and for the way they have continued to support our customers and clients around the world. We have learnt a lot about ourselves over this period, and we have invested in supporting people in a number of ways. In particular, our focus has been on culture, mindset, wellbeing and development. As ever, our approach is informed by the latest thinking in behavioural and data science, and our ability to track effectiveness and progress over time.\n\n## The Barclays Mindset\n\nOur Mindset acts as an operating manual for how to get things done at Barclays. It focuses on three key elements that are core to our success - Empower, Challenge and Drive. Our research shows that when we demonstrate behaviours aligned to these three elements, outcomes are better, colleagues are more engaged and they are more likely to stay longer to build their career at Barclays.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed a number of improvements in the way people were working at Barclays. We reflected on how we could capture these positive developments for the long term and responded this year by launching the Barclays Mindset.\n\nWe have worked hard to encourage this new way of thinking across our organisation, including in the way we hire people, manage performance and recognise success. We have established a global network of over 330 Mindset Champions, working to support its rollout and communicate with colleagues. We have also developed a Mindset Dashboard to measure impact and to help leaders identify where we need to do more to embed this way of thinking.\n\n## Hiring great people\n\nInitial findings suggest our Mindset resonates with colleagues, with 83% telling us they believe it is the right Mindset to drive success at Barclays, and 89% of colleagues saying they believe their teams do a good job of role modelling our Mindset every day.\n\nWe are focused on hiring people with the skills and capabilities to support our strategy. At the heart of our hiring approach is a focus on strengthening our relationships with local talent pools in the areas within which we are hiring, including reaching out to local communities and upskilling local students. For example, our partnerships with universities in Glasgow have been important in developing a robust pipeline of apprentices and graduates at the global campus we officially opened there this year. Our other global campuses in Whippany and Pune leverage similar local hiring arrangements.\n\n## Measuring where we are\n\nColleague engagement\n\nFemales at Managing Director and Director level\n\n82% 2020: 83%\n\n28% 2020: 26%\n\n83% 2020: 87%\n\n'I would recommend Barclays as a good place to work'\n\n'I believe that my team and I do a good job of role modelling Values every day'\n\n'I believe my team and I do a good job of role modelling our Mindset every day' September 2021:\n\n92% 2020: 94%\n\n89% April 2021: 88%",

        "page_content": "## Our people and culture continued\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has required us to adapt to changes in hiring demands and volumes. This has been particularly important in customer-facing areas where we know it is critical that we are providing support to our customers. We have also taken steps to enhance our candidate assessment processes, including factoring in the new Barclays Mindset so we can ensure we're attracting and hiring candidates with the capability to Empower, Challenge and Drive.\n\nWe retain an emphasis on hiring from within. This year, we filled 39% of vacancies internally and added a further 851 graduates to our internal pipeline of future leaders. We also continue to invest in our flagship career development programmes, including our AFTER programme to support those who have been in the armed forces. After a period of in-depth research, we launched new global programmes this year, managing 2,039 graduates, interns and apprentices.\n\n## Our Glasgow campus\n\nOur Glasgow campus is a 500,000 square foot site on the banks of the river Clyde. This is a brownfield area transformed into a new city centre park and is the first Barclays campus to implement a zero waste strategy.\n\nOne of the top priorities while developing the site was to create a world class accessible workspace. We wanted to create a welcoming, inclusive environment for people with physical, cognitive and sensory disabilities, incorporating design for neurodiversity and including people on the autism spectrum. The project team commissioned accessible design specialists, Motionspot, and embarked upon a two-year partnership with Scottish Autism to ensure they met this crucial objective.\n\nThe campus will house Technology, Operations, and Functions teams - bringing new high-value roles to the city. Barclays has grown its workforce in Glasgow by over 90% in the last four years and is on track to have around 5,000 employees on campus by 2023.\n\nAs the world of work transforms in the wake of the pandemic, the Glasgow campus will enable a hybrid approach to office working, striking the right balance between collaboration and flexibility.\n\nThis is the latest step in Barclays' global location strategy which is focused on bringing teams closer together to drive innovation and collaboration.\n\nBeyond the highly-skilled new roles being created within Barclays, the campus is rooted in the local community and economy, with a focus on using local suppliers and contractors wherever possible.\n\nPeople with different perspectives and life experiences make our organisation stronger, so we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce that is as diverse and inclusive as possible. We are an equal opportunities employer and give full and fair consideration to all populations based on their competencies, strengths and potential. You can find more information in our Diversity & Inclusion Report at home.barclays/annualreport.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developing people for the future\n\nA wide range of development opportunities are available to help colleagues build their careers, delivered through our digital learning platform, Learning Lab.\n\nAt Barclays, we believe that everyone has the potential to continuously grow. We are committed to cultivating a culture of lifelong learning and our development proposition is designed to support colleagues at every stage of their career.\n\nThis year we launched a new partnership with LinkedIn Learning, providing extensive digital development to all colleagues globally. We also have a number of corporate memberships with industry experts, allowing our colleagues to remain up to date with the latest developments and trends. In line with our professional qualification guidance, Barclays encourages colleagues to study for degree programmes and professional qualifications that benefit the business and support their development.\n\nWe measure the success of our development offering through our colleague surveys, Your View and Here to Listen, tracking the progression of participants from our leadership development programmes, as well as tracking our levels of retention, and internal mobility. These measures feed into our training and development approach, enabling us to focus action on the right areas for our workforce.\n\nWe are also committed to cultivating leadership skills among colleagues, whether they are in a leadership role or not. The Barclays Leadership Framework provides a guide to support colleagues with their own leadership development, and applies across all levels - from new line managers to our Group Executive Committee. We also continue to operate three flagship leadership development programmes: our Enterprise Leaders Summit, our Strategic Leaders Programme and Aspire.\n\n## Notes\n\n- a   With the appointment of Robert Berry (effective 8 February 2022), the percentage of females on the BPLC Board of Directors decreased to 31%.

        "page_content": "S\n\n## Our people and culture continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe promote a culture of continuous feedback, encouraging all colleagues to have regular performance conversations with their line manager throughout the year. This happens in addition to the annual performance review process that applies to all permanent employees. In these conversations, both 'what' has been achieved as well as 'how' it has been achieved are reviewed. This ensures our colleagues are able to keep broadening their skills, emphasising their personal development and working in a way that reflects our Values and Mindset.\n\nWe also want to help colleagues balance their work life with their personal commitments, supporting career development opportunities at each life stage. We offer enhanced maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental entitlements in all our major jurisdictions.\n\n## NOTE\n\n:\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Companies Act'), Barclays is required to report on the gender breakdown of our employees, 'senior managers', and the Board of Barclays PLC's Directors. The Group's global workforce was 88,565 (48,453 male, 40,058 female, 54 unavailable), with 434 senior managers (342 male, 92 female), and the Board of Barclays PLC had 12 directors (8 male, 4 female) as at 31 December 2021. This is on a headcount basis, including colleagues on long-term leave. Unavailable refers to colleagues who do not record their gender in our systems. The 'male' and 'female' gender splits disclosed in this paragraph are based on Companies Act disclosure requirements and numbers are taken from our employee records which are maintained pursuant to applicable rules and regulations on employee record keeping. For further information on the Group's approach to building a more inclusive company, including a broader range of gender data and characteristics please see our voluntary disclosures included in our Diversity & Inclusion report, published on our website at home.barclays/annualreport. 'Senior managers' is defined by the Companies Act, and is different to both our Senior Managers under the FCA and PRA Senior Managers regime, and our Director and Managing Director corporate grades. It includes Barclays PLC Group Executive Committee members, their direct reports and directors on the boards of undertakings of the Group, but excludes Directors on the Board of Barclays PLC. Where such persons hold multiple directorships across the Group they are only counted once. The definition of 'senior managers' within this disclosure has a narrower scope than the Managing Director and Director female representation data provided.\n\n## Building a supportive and inclusive culture\n\nWe focus on six areas of diversity and inclusion: disability, gender, LGBT+, multicultural, multigenerational and socioeconomic inclusion. We have Employee Resource Groups in place across each of these areas to provide support and advice, create development opportunities and raise awareness of issues and challenges. Membership of our Employee Resource Groups is at an all-time high, with over 25,000 colleagues now involved in one or more. Their insight and experiences help influence our people policies and inform the commitments and actions we take as an organisation to give our people the support they need to succeed.\n\nBuilding a supportive and inclusive culture is not only the right thing to do, but also what is best for our business. It creates a sense of belonging and enables colleagues to perform to their highest capability.\n\nWe strive to embed a culture of inclusion through our allyship initiatives, encouraging colleagues to become allies and to focus on understanding and eliminating barriers faced by underrepresented groups. We provide a toolkit for these colleagues to help them take conscious, positive steps to make everyone feel that they belong. In our Your View survey, 79% of colleagues told us they believe we are all in this together at Barclays, while 82% say they believe leaders are committed to building a diverse workforce.\n\nWe remain committed to improving the diversity of our leaders and to closing pay gaps at Barclays. We aim for diverse promotion assessors and panels, helping us to ensure the widest available pool of talent is considered for promotion. We actively provide development opportunities for leaders of the future such as ex-officio roles and places on our development programmes. As of the end of 2021, 28% of our global Managing Directors and Directors were female, and 30% of our UK Managing Directors and Directors were female.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is delivered virtually and in partnership with a network of internal and external industry thought leaders, and is sponsored by our global senior leadership. The event is designed to empower colleagues to build their digital skills and to help drive a culture of innovation. In 2021, the event combined 11 live sessions, with a range of podcasts and curated online learning resources, delivering a fully rounded learning experience for colleagues. Over 2,000 colleagues attended one or more of the live events, with more watching mobile enabled replays and accessing content through our digital learning platform, Learning Lab.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe closely track the ever-changing composition of our people through online dashboards that make sure our senior leaders understand the diverse makeup and needs of the organisation they lead. Our Inclusion Index, launched in 2020, continues to allow us to measure colleagues' experience of how inclusive the Barclays culture is and gives us a benchmark for monitoring progress year on year. Our overall Inclusion Index score for 2021 is 79%, up from 76% last year. 88% of colleagues say they feel included in their team.\n\nIn the UK, we aim to increase the number of underrepresented minority employees by 25% by the end of 2025. This will take us to 5% overall. In the US, we aim to increase the number of underrepresented minority employees by 20% by the end of 2025. This will take us to 21% overall. In the UK and the US, we aim to at least double the number of Black employees at Managing Director and Director level by the end of 2022, which we are on track to meet.\n\nThrough our Race at Work Action Plan, we are working to close the gaps in the UK and US where some ethnicities are significantly underrepresented at Barclays. We are focusing our efforts across four areas: increasing the number of underrepresented minority employees we hire; providing access to career and development opportunities; creating a culture of allyship across the organisation; and being transparent and measuring our outcomes, allowing us to see the impact our actions are having over time.\n\nThis year, we continued to review the provision of Workplace Adjustments for colleagues with disabilities to further our strategy for a more globally consistent and supportive experience. We encourage managers to check in regularly with their teams and to emphasise the importance of safe working and appropriate workstation setup. As part of the UK Government Disability Confident scheme, we encourage applications from people with a disability, or a physical or mental health condition. We require managers to give full and fair consideration to those with a disability on the basis of strengths, potential and ability, both when hiring and managing. We also ensure opportunities for training, career development and promotion are available to all.\n\nMental health and wellbeing continues to be a major focus, with 88% of colleagues telling us their manager supports their efforts to maintain wellbeing. Through our Be Well programme, we continue to provide expert advice and guidance on the practical steps colleagues can take to look after their physical and mental health. In 2021, we focused on three key areas in particular: a continued commitment to make Barclays a 'mental health confident' organisation, further development of our supportive culture and a renewed emphasis on sustainable working.\n\nWe continue to promote our wellbeing offerings, including the global Be Well portal, with 43% of colleagues registered. Throughout the year, we executed leader-led campaigns to offer practical guidance on looking after physical and mental health, enhancing wellbeing and resilience and a continued focus on safe working. We also focused on stress manageability through ongoing campaigns, and the promotion of Health and Wellbeing workshops. We launched Developing our supportive culture e-learning with 89% completion. We were one of the first businesses to sign up to the Mental Health at Work Commitment and we continue to deploy Mental Health Awareness as required e-learning.\n\nThis year, we launched a new Wellbeing Index, with a starting score of 84%, giving us a metric for measuring the wellbeing of colleagues and informing the Be Well programme. We are very pleased to see colleagues' ability to balance their personal and work demands has improved from 78% in 2020 to 83% in 2021. In time, it will mean we can better understand the impact of particular activities on colleagues wellbeing and continue to evolve the Be Well programme offering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can find more information in our Diversity and Inclusion Report available at home.barclays/annualreport",

In advance of colleagues returning, we risk-assessed all our buildings and provided training to colleagues on the safety measures that would be in place as they returned. We continue to evaluate and adjust these measures in accordance with government guidance and the latest epidemiology.\n\nIn the early stages of the pandemic, Barclays put in place a set of global principles to ensure we were doing as much as possible to support our colleagues. We have kept these principles in place and evolved them with the changing nature of the pandemic. The principles and provisions have helped colleagues cope with some of the personal challenges the pandemic has created, including offering additional paid leave to support self-quarantine, isolation, vaccination, sickness or care for dependants and advice made available to help support physical and mental health. Colleagues who have returned to on-site working did so on a voluntary basis and we have worked closely with any colleagues who have concerns about returning, to understand those concerns and support them.\n\nWe are also thinking carefully about the future of work at Barclays. We want to balance the best of the past with the best of what we have proved possible during the pandemic. We have adopted the principle that the optimal physical location for a role is largely determined by the nature and requirements of that role. At the same time, it is important to us that everyone at Barclays, no matter what their role, maintains a strong connection to their colleagues at a Barclays site.\n\nIn support of our approach to future ways of working, we have revised and relaunched our principles, process and guidance on Working Flexibly. At Barclays, we encourage colleagues to work flexibly to balance and integrate their work and other life commitments, enhance their wellbeing and effectiveness at work and feel included, irrespective of personal circumstances. We have expanded the opportunity for many colleagues to work in a hybrid pattern, spending part of their time working from a Barclays site and part of their time working from home. Over the course of the year, colleagues have begun to transition to this new, hybrid way of working. We are taking a test and learn approach, and ways of working will continue to iterate into 2022 as we focus on balancing the benefits of working on site with more flexible solutions.\n\n## Ethnicity Representation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther ethnically diverse colleagues category includes Mixed, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander and Native American.

In addition, this year we continued to run regular Here to Listen surveys, first launched in 2020, to make sure we're staying abreast of colleague feedback during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results from these regular surveys are shared directly with leadership, so action can be taken to continue to provide the appropriate support for colleagues.\n\nWe think colleague engagement should be a two-way exercise, with equal weight placed on listening to our people and on keeping them informed. We want to be able to consider our colleagues' perspective when we make decisions, including at the most senior level.\n\nThe results from our surveys are also an important part of the conversations our Board and Executive Committee have about our culture and how we run Barclays. These survey results help our Board and Executive Committee take into account our colleagues' views in their decision-making. We update the Board and its relevant sub-committees throughout the year and in addition, our leaders engage regularly with colleagues to hear what they think, visiting branches, trading floors and offices as well as hosting virtual forums. Direct engagement, a comprehensive reporting approach and dedicated time at Board meetings,  enables the Board to determine that our workforce engagement approach is effective. We make sure we are keeping everyone up to date on the strategy, performance and progress of the organisation, through a combination of leader-led engagement, digital and print communication, blogs, vlogs and podcasts.\n\nOur people are also encouraged to seek the views of colleagues with different perspectives and experiences via a series of monthly events and podcasts called Courageous Conversations that provides a platform for meaningful conversations on diversity, equity and inclusion topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe engage with our people collectively through a strong and effective partnership with Unite, as well as the Barclays Group European Forum, representing colleagues within the European Union, and other colleague forums. We regularly brief our union partners on the strategy and progress of the business, seeking their input on ways in which we can improve the colleague experience of working for Barclays. The collective bargaining coverage of Unite in the UK represents 84% of our UK workforce and 48% of our global workforce. We consult in detail with colleague representatives on major change programmes affecting our people. We do this to help us minimise compulsory job losses, including through voluntary redundancy and redeployment, with a focus on reskilling.\n\nWe maintain an engagement approach that is in line with the UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) governance recommendations. This extends to those who work for us indirectly as well, such as contractors. As of 2021, the Barclays Third Party Supplier Code of Conduct states that all third parties with greater than 250 employees must demonstrate through annual reporting that effective workforce engagement mechanisms are in place to provide channels for the workforce to share ideas and concerns with senior management and the board.\n\nOur people policies are designed to recruit the best people, provide equal opportunities and create an inclusive culture, in line with our Values and in support of our long-term success. They also reflect relevant employment law, including the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n\nWe are committed to paying our people fairly and appropriately relative to their role, skills, experience and performance - in a way that balances the needs of all our stakeholders. That means our remuneration policies reward sustainable performance that is in line with our Purpose and Values, as well as our risk expectations.\n\nWe expect our people to treat each other with dignity and respect, and do not tolerate discrimination, bullying, harassment or victimisation on any grounds.\n\n## You can find more information in our Fair Pay Report at home. barclays/annualreport\n\nWe encourage our people to benefit from Barclays' performance by enrolling in our share ownership plans, further strengthening their commitment to the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can find out more information in the Directors' Remuneration Report in Part 2 of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our policies",

It is estimated that at least $3-5 trillion b of additional investment will be needed each year, for the next 30 years, in order to finance the transition.\n\nAddressing climate change is an urgent and complex challenge. It requires a fundamental transformation of the global economy, so that society stops adding to the total amount of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) in the atmosphere.\n\nAt Barclays, we are determined to play our part.\n\nWe have a strategy to turn that ambition into action:\n\nIn March 2020, we announced our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, becoming one of the first banks to do so.\n\n## 1.

Financing the transition\n\nOur strategy is underpinned by the way we assess and manage our exposure to climate-related risk. From 2022, climate risk will be a Principal Risk under Barclays' Enterprise Risk Management Framework.",

Barclays continues to remain carbon neutral a for its Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel b emissions. We intend to remain carbon neutral, while investing in the continued decarbonisation of our operations and in the development of a net zero pathway for the emissions from our supply chain.\n\n## Say on Climate\n\nIn line with our commitment to offer shareholders a 'Say on Climate', we will be publishing an update on our climate strategy, targets and methodology in advance of the 2022 Annual General Meeting. This will include 2030 targets for two new sectors, Cement and Metals (Steel).\n\n## Notes\n\n- b.   See our ESG section on pages 54 to 56 for further detail on how we are defining our approach to net zero operations.\n- a.   We are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets.\n- c.   Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants.\n- e.   Further information and a detailed methodology white paper are available online, see home.barclays/sustainability/addressingclimate-change/\n- d.   Scope 2 emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity and purchased steam and chilled water.\n\nMore information on our approach, including our progress on the global renewable energy initiative, RE100 is set out in the ESG section of this report.\n\nMost of our emissions result from the activities of the clients that we finance and those generated in their respective value chains. These are so-called 'financed emissions' and fall within the general definition of Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## Reducing our financed emissions\n\nIn November 2020, we published details of our strategy for measuring and managing alignment of our financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. Our approach is underpinned by BlueTrack TMe , a methodology we have developed for measuring our financed emissions and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals of the Paris Agreement. BlueTrack TM builds on and extends existing industry approaches to cover not only lending but ,also capital markets financing. This better reflects the breadth of our support for clients through our investment bank.\n\nWe have used BlueTrack\u2122 to assess the financed emissions of our client portfolios in the Energy and Power sectors, prioritising these two sectors because they are responsible for up to three-quarters of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions globally and because Barclays has meaningful exposure to them. Therefore, they represented the most appropriate starting place from which to make a significant difference. In November 2020, we set a target for a 30% reduction in the CO2 intensity of our Power portfolio by 2025, as well as a target for a 15% CO2 reduction in absolute emissions of our Energy portfolio by 2025. Progress against both these targets is set out in the ESG report section of this report on pages 51 to 140.\n\nWe are setting targets, informed by Paris-aligned benchmark scenarios, to reduce our financed emissions. We also have clear restrictions on financing certain energy sector activities, including relating to thermal coal, oil sands, hydraulic fracturing (commonly known as 'fracking') and projects in the Arctic Circle.\n\ncla",

        "page_content": "## Growing with society continued\n\nWe believe that Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, rather than by simply phasing out support for some of the clients who are most engaged in it. We believe that banks, especially those like Barclays with a large capital markets business, are in a unique position to help accelerate the transition towards a low-carbon economy, as many of our clients have already begun to do so.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy is today's defining opportunity for innovation and growth. There is a significant opportunity for Barclays to play a leading role in helping to meet the demand for climate change related financing to support the transition.\n\n## Financing the transition\n\nWe are directing investment, including our own capital, into new green technologies and infrastructure projects that will build up low-carbon capacity and capability.\n\nBarclays continued to make significant progress in 2021 against our target to facilitate \u00a3150bn of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing from 2018 to 2025. On a cumulative basis, by year-end 2021, we have facilitated \u00a3193.3bn \u0394 since 2018, exceeding our target four years early.\n\nWe also aim to facilitate \u00a3100bn of financing specifically focused on green activities by 2030. We facilitated \u00a329.8bn \u0394 of green financing a in 2021, up 70% from \u00a317.6bn in 2020 and comprised of:\n\n- \u25a0 sustainability-linked financing that incorporates environmental performance targets (\u00a37.2bn \u0394 in 2021).\n- \u25a0 labelled, 'use of proceeds' and business mix financing in environmental categories (\u00a322.6bn \u0394 in 2021), and\n\nSince 2018, we have facilitated a total of \u00a362.2bn \u0394 across these categories with significant momentum across our businesses, products and geographies.\n\nThe Programme has made meaningful progress towards its five-year trajectory to meet our target by building a portfolio of strategic investments which have a focus on reducing carbon footprints and accelerating the net zero transition. \u00a354m of the \u00a3175m overall target has been deployed since 2020, with \u00a330m invested in 2021, up 25% from 2020.\n\nOur Sustainable Impact Capital Programme, led by the Barclays Principal Investments team in Treasury, has a mandate to invest up to \u00a3175m of equity capital in sustainability-focused start-ups by 2025, helping to accelerate our clients' transition towards a low-carbon economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detail on our progress against these targets and our range of green and sustainable product solutions can be found in the ESG report section between pages 51 to 104.\n\n## Managing climate-related risks\n\nIn 2020, the Board Risk Committee made the decision that climate risk would become a Principal Risk within the ERMF from 2022.\n\nWe broadly categorise climate risks into three types: transition risk, physical risk and connected risk. Within these broad categories, we identify a number of factors arising from climate change that we monitor over the short, medium and long term. We manage these risks through our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), setting our strategic approach for risk management by defining standards, objectives and responsibilities for all areas of Barclays. The ERMF is complemented by a number of other frameworks, policies and standards, all of which are aligned to individual Principal Risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information, please see the Risk Management section of this report on pages 200 to 294.\n\nOur Climate Change Statement sets out our approach to managing the impact of our climate-related activities. We have developed internal standards to reflect these positions in more detail, including for Forestry & Agricultural Commodities and for World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands. These standards sit under the management of Reputation Risk in the ERMF.\n\nThese standards determine our approach to climate change and relevant sensitive sectors and are enforced through an existing transaction origination, review and approval process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\n\u0394 2021 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

Older people needed help understanding the fast-moving position of coronavirus rules and vaccinations, and how to safely access health and social care, as well as food and prescriptions. Demand for Age UK's Telephone Friendship service increased by almost 300% as older people turned to the charity to overcome feelings of loneliness.\n\nBarclays partnership with Age UK has enabled the charity to answer thousands of calls to its National Advice Line and increase the number of friendship calls through its Telephone Friendship service, offering companionship and emotional support, which more than 100 Barclays colleagues are helping them to make.\n\nOur partnership also provided vital funds to local Age UKs, enabling them to respond to the specific needs of local communities in response to the crisis.

The net release included a reversal of \u00a31.3bn in non-default charges, primarily reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook. Excluding this reversal, the charge was \u00a30.7bn, reflecting reduced unsecured lending balances and low delinquency. Economic uncertainty adjustments have been maintained firstly in respect of customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to the withdrawal of support schemes and emerging economic uncertainty, and secondly, model uncertainty which does not capture certain macroeconomic and risk parameter uncertainties.

The Group's capital management objective is to maximise shareholder value by prudently managing the level and mix of its capital. This is to ensure the Group and all of its subsidiaries are appropriately capitalised relative to their minimum regulatory and stressed capital requirements, and to support the Group's risk appetite, growth, and strategic options while seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## CET1 ratio\n\nThe ratio expresses the Group's CET1 capital as a percentage of its RWAs. RWAs are a measure of the Group's assets adjusted for their associated risks.\n\nRoTE measures our ability to generate acceptable returns for shareholders. It is calculated as profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders as a proportion of average shareholders' equity excluding non-controlling interests and other equity instruments adjusted for the deduction of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\n## Group RoTE\n\nThis measure indicates the return generated by the management of the business based on shareholders' tangible equity. Achieving a target RoTE demonstrates the organisation's ability to execute its strategy and to align management's interests with those of its shareholders. RoTE lies at the heart of the Group's capital allocation and performance management process.\n\nBarclays views total operating expenses as a key strategic area for banks; those which actively manage costs and control them effectively will gain a strong competitive advantage.\n\n## Total operating expenses\n\n## Cost: income ratio\n\nThe cost: income ratio measures total operating expenses as a percentage of total income and is used to assess the productivity of our business operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group targets a CET1 ratio in the range of 13-14%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBarclays continues to target RoTE of greater than 10% over the medium term.\n\n## Note\n\n- a Includes litigation and conduct, 2021: \u00a3177m, 2020: \u00a3153m and 2019: \u00a31,849m, of which \u00a31,400m relates to Payment Protection Insurance.\n\nGroup total operating e\n\n\u00a30.6bn of structural c\n\nincreased 4% t\n\nhigher performance c\n\ngrowth, par\n\ncontinued inv\n\nfavourability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na lower bank levy char\n\nThe Group will continue to drive efficiencies while investing in its franchise where appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCost discipline remains a priority and we continue to target a cost: income ratio below 60%.",

These risks are managed as part of our business model.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n\nThe ERMF governs the way in which Barclays identifies and manages its risks.\n\nAt Barclays, risks are identified and overseen through the ERMF, which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture.\n\nThe management of risk is then embedded into each level of the business, with all colleagues being responsible for identifying and controlling risk.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nGiven the increasing risks associated with climate change, and to support the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, it was agreed that climate risk would become a Principal Risk from 2022.\n\nRisk appetite defines the level of risk we are prepared to accept across the different risk types, taking into consideration varying levels of financial and operational stress. Risk appetite is key to our decision-making processes, including ongoing business planning and setting of strategy, new product approvals and business change initiatives.\n\nThe Group sets its risk appetite in terms of performance metrics as well as a set of mandate and scale limits to monitor risks. A Group level climate risk appetite was introduced in line with the Group's risk appetite approach. During 2021, the Group's performance remained within its risk appetite limits.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nThe second line of defence is made up of Risk and Compliance and oversees the first line by setting limits, rules and constraints on their operations, consistent with the risk appetite.\n\nThe first line of defence is comprised of the revenuegenerating and client-facing areas, along with all associated support functions, including Finance, Treasury, Human Resources and Operations and Technology. The first line identifies the risks, sets the controls and escalates risk events to the second line of defence.\n\nThe third line of defence is comprised of Internal Audit, providing independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee on the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n\nAlthough the Legal function does not sit in any of the three lines, it works to support them all and plays a key role in overseeing Legal risk throughout the Group. The Legal function is also subject to oversight from the Risk and Compliance functions (second line) with respect to the management of operational and conduct risks.\n\n## Monitoring the risk profile\n\nDuring 2021, Barclays ran a range of stress tests to assess its capital adequacy and resilience under severe but plausible macroeconomic scenarios. The internal stress test scenario was based on current economic imbalances such as supply chain issues and labour shortage deteriorating further due to post COVID-19 heightened demand and climate transition pressures. This resulted in high inflation and unexpected increases in base rates (both in the UK and the US) causing an affordability stress for retail customers and corporates along with hindering the post COVID-19 recovery in term of GDP and unemployment. In addition, Barclays participated in the Bank of England (BoE) Solvency Stress Test which was a reverse stress test modelling a pessimistic view of the aftermath of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis with more severe shocks (GDP, Unemployment, and HPI) than prior stress exercises. The results of these tests met the Group risk appetite and capital adequacy.\n\nTogether with a strong governance process, using business and Group level Risk Committees as well as Board level forums, the Board receives regular information in respect of the risk profile of the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for Group risk appetite and capital plans. Information received includes measures of risk profile against risk appetite as well as the identification of new and emerging risks.\n\nWe believe that our structure and governance supports us in managing risk in the changing economic, political and market environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further detailed analysis of approach to risk management and risk performance, please see our full Risk review on pages 200 to 294 of Part 2 of the Annual Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n' To support the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, it was agreed that climate risk would become a Principal Risk from 2022.\n\ncla",

This time frame is used in management's Working Capital and Viability Report (WCR), prepared at the start of February 2022. The WCR is a formal projection of capital and liquidity based upon formal profitability forecasts. The availability of the WCR gives management and the Board sufficient visibility and confidence on the future operating environment for this time period.\n\n## Time horizon\n\nThe three-year time frame has also been chosen because:\n\n- \u25a0 it is also within the period over which internal stress testing is carried out\n- \u25a0 it is within the period covered by the formal medium-term plans approved by the Board which contain projections of profitability, cash flows, capital requirements and capital resources\n- \u25a0 it is representative of the period and level of anticipated regulatory change in the financial services industry.\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that this period is sufficient to enable a reasonable assessment of viability to be made.\n\n## Considerations\n\n- \u25a0 carried out a robust and detailed assessment of the Group's risk profile and material existing and emerging risks (see material existing and emerging risks section), in particular those risks which senior management believes could cause the Group's future results of operations or financial condition to differ materially from current expectations or could adversely impact the Group's ability to meet regulatory requirements\n\nIn making its assessment the Board has:\n\n- \u25a0 reviewed how those risks are identified, managed and controlled (further detail provided on pages 44 to 46)\n- \u25a0 considered the Group's Medium Term Plan\n- \u25a0 considered the WCR which provides an assessment of forecast CET1, leverage, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, as well as the build-up of MREL up to the end of 2024\n- \u25a0 reviewed the Group's liquidity and funding profile, including forecasts of the Group's internal Liquidity Risk Appetite (LRA) and regulatory liquidity coverage ratios\n- \u25a0 considered the stability of the major markets in which it operates, supply chain resilience and regulatory changes\n- \u25a0 considered the Group's viability under specific internal stress scenarios\n- \u25a0 considered the sustainability of any future capital distributions\n- \u25a0 considered scenarios which might affect the operational resilience of the Group\n- \u25a0 considered factors that may inform the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including (among other things), further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, effectiveness  of vaccines, the emergence of new strains of COVID-19, inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions\n- \u25a0 reviewed the draft statutory accounts and the in-depth disclosure of the financial performance of the Group\n- \u25a0 considered the impact of the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and support its clients' transition to a low-carbon economy, including the need to incorporate climate considerations into its strategy, business model, the products and services it provides to customers and its financial and non-financial risk management processes\n- \u25a0 reviewed the possible impact of legal, competition and regulatory matters set out in Note 26 to the financial statements on pages 388 to 392.\n\nThe Group's Medium Term Plan is based on assumptions for macroeconomic variables like interest rates, inflation, unemployment, which have been consistently applied for the purpose of forecasting the Group's capital and liquidity position and ratios, as well as any credit impairment charges or releases.\n\n## Assessment\n\nManagement and the Board then oversee the ongoing risk profile. Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board and Executive Committee over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current and evolving risks.\n\nRisks faced by the Group's business, including in respect of financial, conduct and operational risks, are controlled and managed within the Group in line with the ERMF. Executive management sets a risk appetite for the Group, which is then approved by the Board. Risk and Compliance set limits, within which businesses are required to operate.\n\nA full set of material risks to which the organisation is exposed can be found in the material existing and emerging risks on pages 204 to 215 in Part 2 of the Report.\n\n## These particular risks include:\n\nCertain risks are additionally identified as key themes and monitored closely by the Board and Board Committees. These are chosen on the basis of their potential to impact viability over the time frame of the assessment but in some instances the risks exist beyond this time frame.\n\n- \u25a0 the potential impact of the combination of the COVID-19 pandemic, further trading disruption between the UK and the EU and general supply chain disruption which could lead to UK economic weakness and further rises in UK inflation.  These risks may result in an adverse impact on profitability and capital through increased costs and increased expected credit losses\n- \u25a0 embedding climate risk into the Group's risk framework in line with regulatory expectations, and adapting the Group's operations and business strategy to address both the financial risks resulting from: (i) the physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy",

The evolving operating environment presents opportunities and risks which we continue to evaluate and take steps to appropriately adapt our strategy and its delivery.\n\nThe Group-wide stress testing framework also includes internal reverse stress testing assessments, which aim to identify the circumstances under which the Group's business model would no longer be viable, leading to a significant change in business strategy and to the identification of appropriate mitigating actions. Examples include extreme macroeconomic downturn ('severely adverse') scenarios, or specific idiosyncratic events, covering both operational risk and capital/ liquidity items. Reverse stress testing is used to help support ongoing risk management and is an input to the Group's recovery planning process.\n\nThe results of the internal stress test were  approved by the Board Risk Committee and allowed the Board to approve the Medium Term Plan as being able to sustain a severe but plausible  scenario and remain within Risk Appetite.\n\nLegal proceedings, competition, regulatory and remediation/redress conduct matters are also assessed as part of the stress testing process. Capital and LRA are set at a level designed to enable the Group to withstand various stress scenarios. As part of this process, management also identified actions, including cost reductions and withdrawal from lines of business, available to restore the Group to its desired capital flight path. These internal stress tests informed the conclusions of the WCR.\n\nBased on current forecasts, incorporating key known regulatory changes to be enacted and having considered possible stress scenarios, the current liquidity and capital position of the Group continues to support the Board's assessment of the Group's viability.\n\n## Stress tests\n\n- \u25a0 high peak inflation (UK: 6.5%) underpinned by high energy prices, supply chain issues and climate transition resulting in central banks increasing base rates rapidly (UK 4% / US 3.5%), depressing demand and slowing the economy\n\nThe Board has also considered the Group's viability under specific internal stress scenarios. The latest macroeconomic internal stress test, conducted in Q4 2021, considered the potential impact of:\n\n- \u25a0 central banks' liquidity being withdrawn causing downward pressure on asset prices and high volatility. Higher borrowing costs impacting businesses which lay off workers (unemployment UK: 9.2% / US 9.5%) and impact consumer spending\n- \u25a0 intensified climate transition through government policy, shareholder pressure and shifting public opinion. A push to 'green' drove costs higher which amplified inflationary pressures and depressed demand. This aggravated the stress and dampened the recovery.\n- \u25a0 the sharp increase in mortgage servicing costs seeing a significant decrease in house prices, given already stretched valuations\n\nAll of the above could result in, among other things, a loss of income or increased impairment. The stress test outcome for macroeconomic tests shows our full financial performance over the horizon of the scenario and focuses on the CET1 capital ratio.",

Barclays continues to remain carbon neutral for its Scope 1 b , Scope 2 c and Scope 3 business travel d emissions since 2020. We intend to remain carbon neutral, while investing in the continued decarbonisation of our operations and in the development of a net zero pathway for the emissions from our supply chain.\n\nWe are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets.\n\nIn 2020, we disclosed that we were already net zero from our own operations, based on the common understanding at that time, that net zero and carbon neutral were interchangeable terms. To reflect the most recent interpretations of both of these terms in public disclosure, we will make a distinction between net zero operations and carbon neutral in our disclosures from now on.\n\nWe continue to remain carbon neutral, by reducing or eliminating sources of carbon dioxide emissions associated with our operations and business travel and by compensating any remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).\n\n## Decarbonising our operations\n\nIn 2021, we met our target with 94% \u0394 of the electricity used across our global property portfolio coming from renewable sources. This transition to renewable sources of energy contributed to Barclays exceeding its target of 80% GHG emissions reduction for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market based) emissions by achieving an 86% \u0394 reduction in 2021. Over the coming years, in addition to using green tariff e and energy attributes certificates f to achieve our RE100 commitment, we aim to sign Power Purchase Agreements g and increase on-site renewable energy generation. We intend to generate 10% of our key campuses total operational\n\nIn 2019, we joined the global corporate renewable energy initiative, RE100 with a commitment to source 100% renewable electricity for our global property portfolio by 2030, with an interim goal of 90% by 2021.\n\n## Notes\n\n- a.   Operations include company cars, offices, retail branches and data centres where Barclays have operational control.\n\nenergy from on-site renewables by 2035. For example, we have installed a solar panel power plant in our Pune campus that has reduced our emissions by 80tCO2e from February to September 2021 and we are building a Sustainability Centre in our Glasgow campus that will provide self-generated solar energy for our Glasgow campus.\n\nAt the same time as continuing our transition to renewable electricity, we intend to decarbonise our global property portfolio by progressively eliminating the use of fossil fuels currently used to heat and cool our buildings. We will continue removing the use of natural gas in our buildings, replacing gas boilers with carbon-free heating technologies when feasible. We will also continue to embed circular economy principles to reduce waste in our buildings and support the regeneration of natural systems.\n\n\u0394 2021 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants.\n- d.

Global EAC standards for renewable claims are primarily Guarantees of Origin in Europe, RECs in North America and International RECs (I-RECs) in a growing number of countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nThe standards available to understand and define net zero are rapidly evolving. We will continue to review and develop our own approach to net zero operations as this subject area matures.",

        "page_content": "## ESG: Environment continued\n\n## Improving the energy efficiency of our operations\n\n## Making our operations more environmentally sustainable\n\nIn 2021, we launched an Energy Optimisation Programme to help improve the energy efficiency of our global property portfolio. The programme aims to improve our building management system (BMS) controls, including our use of air conditioning units and energy efficient technologies such as LED lighting, as well as our ability to adjust to changing occupancy requirements and weather conditions. To align with the UK Green Building Council net zero building pathway recommendations, we intend to achieve a 70% energy intensity reduction across our key campuses by 2035.\n\nWe continue to work to ensure our facilities consume fewer resources, maximise the re-use of our materials and improve indoor environmental quality.\n\nOur ambition is to achieve and maintain TRUE (Total Resource Use and Efficiency) zero waste certified projects across our key campuses by 2035, which means we must divert a minimum of 90% of solid, non-hazardous wastes from the environment, landfill, incineration (waste-to-energy) to recycling facilities or locations where the waste can be reused.\n\nIn 2021, we produced 4,014 tonnes of waste across our key sites; while this is a 76% reduction in comparison to 2018; we recognise that we need to do more. The reduction in waste was largely driven by our new hybrid working model accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the investment in our digital capabilities. For example, we reduced the volume of purchased paper by 91% compared to 2018.\n\n## Minimising our travel emissions\n\nIn 2021, total colleague air travel emissions were 1,797 tCO2e, with a 97% reduction against a 2018 baseline, accelerated by travel restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we move to more normalised business travel levels after the pandemic, we recognise we may see an increase in travel emissions in future years. All emissions related to our business travel are offset.\n\nEven though employee travel is a relatively small source of our carbon emissions, we intend to minimise travel emissions where we can. We do this by leveraging digital technology where possible as an alternative to face-to-face meetings, adjusting our travel policy to promote low-carbon solutions and avoid non-essential business trips and using our booking and reporting platforms to improve colleagues' awareness of their individual carbon footprint.\n\n## Engaging our colleagues\n\nWe want to engage our colleagues and help them upskill as we all transition to a low-carbon economy and try to lower their personal carbon footprint. We partner with a number of community programmes for colleagues to take part in, and raise awareness on global environmental campaigns such as the World Environment Day and Earth Hour, as well as operating 11 employee-led environmental networks globally. In 2021, we piloted a colleague app where users earn 'green points' for completing sustainable actions such as avoiding single-use plastic and switching off monitors when they are not being used. This resulted in more than 850 employees in the UK taking more than 6,000 actions, helping to avoid an estimated 15,000 kg CO2e.\n\n## Carbon offsetting\n\nWe conduct due diligence as part of our procurement of carbon offsets. We have invested in a portfolio of credits, under the VCS, that come from approved methodologies. In addition to internal reviews, we also undertake third-party review of the project portfolio from an independent voluntary carbon markets advisory firm, which is not directly involved in the sourcing process. All final projects must pass independent due diligence screening based on risk assessment in five key areas: location, technology, additionality, environmental and social impacts as well as environmental and social benefits.\n\nWe purchase carbon offsets, under the VCS to compensate for any remaining emissions in our operations and business travel.\n\nAs part of our operational and business travel carbon offsetting strategy, we maintain support for naturebased climate solutions. This includes the purchase of carbon credits from REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) avoided deforestation projects, as well as a project by Indigo which seeks to enhance soil carbon in agricultural land. We recognise the importance of ensuring the integrity of natural capital and we screen nature-based offsets against established methodologies and where possible, have additional environmental and social co-benefits.\n\nWe firmly support initiatives to enhance the integrity and quality of the voluntary carbon markets including the work of the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets.\n\nTo support our waste reduction strategy, our Glasgow campus has already partnered with Soulriders to redistribute surplus food to local charities and started to replace single use items with reusable items and repurposed the onsite compost for our landscaping needs.\n\nTo support our efforts to design and operate sustainable buildings, we aim to follow sustainability best practices, including the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification programme and international green building standards, such as Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) and GreenMark. In 2021, 45% of our global property portfolio had green building certifications, and 35% buildings remain certified to ISO 14001, the international standard for designing and implementing an Environmental Management System (EMS). Our ambition is to roll out ISO 14001 certifications across our key campuses by 2025.\n\nWe continue to work to improve the efficiency of our water consumption across our key campuses by investing in water saving infrastructure. For example, Pune was our first campus to have a fully integrated rainwater harvesting system to store and repurpose 50,000 litres of rainwater.",

The methodology used for emissions calculation is the WRI/ WBCSD Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. We have adopted the operational control approach on reporting boundaries. For more information, see the Barclays ESG Reporting Framework 2021 on our ESG Resource Hub.\n- 1   Emission reductions and intensities have been reported using the market based methodology.\n- 3   For 2021, we have applied the latest emission factors available at the time of reporting. We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated carbon emission factors, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. We have recalculated this information from our previous 2020 reporting year. Where the recalculation of our performance using updated carbon emissions factors and improvements in data quality and estimates has resulted in a change of more than 5% we have represented these figures in the table above. In 2021, we conducted a review of our GHG emissions inventory for Scope 1 and Scope 2 to improve the transparency of our public emissions disclosure. Historically, Barclays have chosen to account for third party managed data centres under Scope 1 and Scope 2. Based on our review, and with due regard to the GHG Protocol Guidelines and Operational Control definitions, we have updated our GHG accounting policy and reallocated the emissions of third party managed data centres under Scope 3 'downstream leased assets', which will be reported in future. This reallocation is reflective of our limited control over energy sources at third party managed data centres. We have therefore re-baselined our historic emissions for 2018 and updated our reported figures for subsequent years. The previously reported Scope 2 (location based) emissions were: 2018 (203,100 tCO2e), 2019 (182,000 tCO2e) and 2020 (159,500 tCO2e). In addition, a correction to underlying fugitive consumption data was identified, which has resulted in an adjustment to 2018-2020 fugitives emissions. The previously reported Scope 1 emissions were: 2018 (25,900 tCO2e), 2019 (23,800 tCO2e) and 2020 (18,800 tCO2e).\n- \u0394   2021 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

        "page_content": "S\n\nE\n\nS\n\n## ESG: Environment continued\n\nBarclays is committed to aligning its financing with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Reducing our financed emissions\n\nIn 2020, we set an ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050 and committed to align all of our financing to the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe started by setting targets for the Energy and Power sectors because they are responsible for up to three-quarters of all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions globally. As a founding member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), we intend to use sciencebased decarbonisation scenarios to set targets for a number of high emitting sectors by 2024.\n\nIn order to meet this ambition, we need to reduce the client emissions that we finance, not just for lending but for capital markets activities as well. To help us achieve that, we developed BlueTrack\u2122 a , our methodology for measuring financed emissions and tracking them at a portfolio level against the goals of the Paris Agreement. BlueTrack\u2122 builds on and extends existing industry approaches to cover not only lending but also capital markets financing. We believe our approach to measuring financed emissions better reflects the breadth of our provision of financing for clients through our investment bank.\n\nWhen we developed BlueTrack\u2122, we acknowledged it was a first generation methodology and we would continue to enhance and refine it.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to develop our methodology including adding granularity and updating external client and industry data as these become available over time. We have re-performed the 2020 year-end estimates (as reported in 2020) by enhancing those estimates with the improved data that became available during 2021.\n\nOn a net basis, these changes had no notable impact on our baseline data as reported. As our methodology evolves we will continue to review the impact on our reported baselines and we will re-perform estimates from time to time with available data.\n\nWe continue to evolve our approach and welcome the continuing industry efforts to converge on a common standard.\n\nThere is no consistent industry-wide approach to measuring emissions and approaches continue to evolve. We are actively involved in industry-wide initiatives to build consensus on carbon accounting and portfolio alignment, for example through our membership of the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).\n\n## Say on Climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found at: home. barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/ reporting-and-disclosures/\n\nIn line with our commitment to offer shareholders a 'Say on Climate', we will be publishing an update on our climate strategy, targets and methodology in advance of the 2022 Annual General Meeting. This will include 2030 targets for two new sectors, Cement and Metals (Steel).\n\n## Energy and Power\n\nIn 2021, we reduced our absolute financed emissions in Energy by 22%, exceeding our 2025 Energy target. This reflects year-on-year reductions in borrowing and capital markets volumes across the market to more normalised levels, as well as conscious changes to our lending portfolio, where we have re-evaluated credit risk limits in segments of the Energy sector which could be most adversely affected by climate change. In 2022, a post COVID-19 pandemic rebound of the markets may result in increased issuance volumes which in turn may reverse some of our progress achieved to date. However, we also expect to see further reduction in our clients' emissions as they implement their transition plans.\n\nIn November 2020, we set a target for a 30% reduction in the CO2 intensity of our Power portfolio by 2025, as well as a target for a 15% reduction in absolute CO2 emissions of our Energy portfolio by 2025.\n\nOur Power portfolio has seen an 8% net decrease in emissions intensity during 2021, reflecting changes in both our lending and capital markets activity. We have supported our Power clients in transitioning their business models in 2021, across all sectors, we facilitated \u00a329.8bn \u0394 of total green financing, up 70% from \u00a317.6bn in 2020. This includes \u00a32.5bn used to directly fund renewable power generation projects. This increase in green financing b across the Power sector reflects the increased emphasis both issuers and investors are placing on accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy, which is reflected in the reduction in emissions intensity of our financing.\n\nWhile we have seen solid progress against our targets in 2021, it is important to note that progress towards our targets will likely be volatile and non-linear. The transition to a low-carbon economy will be reflective of the specific pathways companies take. For some sectors progress can occur in the short term while for others, the technologies required to transition are not yet fully available meaning they are likely to transition at a later point in time.\n\nAchieving our targets will largely depend on our clients' progress on their individual transition pathways. Many of our clients have published their own transition plans and report on their progress; other clients have not yet made their transition plans public. We expect that, over time, more clients will publish plans and also that many of our clients will be able to accelerate their plans beyond what is known today. In the short term, we may experience significant decreases or increases in our metrics, partly due to the volatility of the mix and volume of capital markets financing (included in our metrics) which is generally beyond our control and due to the pace of our clients' emission reductions.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b.

There has been a notable acceleration in clients' targets and climate commitments, particularly as they look to decarbonise their own operations (Scope 1 and 2) with some clients also now including Scope 3 emissions in their climate targets. In our Energy portfolio, approximately three quarters of our financing is with Energy producers that have published decarbonisation targets; over half of our\n\nfinancing is to clients that have committed to becoming net zero in their Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. We have also seen an increase in decarbonisation commitments from our Power utilities clients. As companies release their annual reported metrics for 2021 in the coming months, we expect to see further details and evidence of their progress against their commitments, which will be reflected in our metric over time.\n\n## Just Transition\n\nIn 2021, Barclays joined over 40 financial institutions and stakeholders to form the Financing a Just Transition Alliance (FJTA), coordinated by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE). The Alliance\n\nBarclays recognises the need to sustain and support livelihoods and communities in the UK and around the world as we support our clients to transition to a low-carbon economy. A Just Transition is essential for achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement envisages that appropriate financial resources, new technology and an enhanced capacity building framework are put in place to support action by those countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Governments and the private sector each have roles to play in ensuring that the transition to a low-carbon economy is not carried out at the expense of vulnerable communities, social welfare, and access to decent work and quality jobs. Financial institutions have a role to play in integrating social considerations into their supply chains, policies, and decision-making as part of their participation in the transition towards a low-carbon economy.\n\naims to translate the concept of a Just Transition into tangible steps and outcomes. In 2021, Barclays contributed to the report, 'Just Zero: 2021 Report of the UK Financing a Just Transition Alliance', which sets out requirements for a Just Transition in the UK, while highlighting potential applications in an international context.\n\nThe report featured a Barclays case study, focusing on Barclays' Rebuilding Thriving Local Economies (RTLE) programme. The RTLE  is a five-year initiative, launched in 2018, that aims to boost local economies across the UK through cooperation with local authorities, academics, schools and business groups. The coastal community of Great Yarmouth was announced as a RTLE pilot area in March 2021; its large offshore wind sector represents a growing industry key to the decarbonisation of the UK's energy supply. While in the early stages of this pilot, Barclays began to scope out ways to help facilitate a Just Transition, focusing on two areas - supporting local businesses and addressing the local skills gap. Barclays will work directly with businesses, business groups and local business leadership to help them find opportunities for growth and job creation from the transition.\n\n## Our current estimate of our clients' activity based on our disclosed methodology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BlueTrack\u2122 financed emissions - Power\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe 2021 Benchmark OECD data provided is interpolated i.e. As the IEA 2019 SDS OECD report only provides data for certain time points, the years in between these time points are linearly interpolated to generate estimated values, including the value used for 2021.",

The financial sector will have an important role to play in stewarding responsible finance and in supporting new financial flows for a naturepositive future. As a financial services institution, this includes understanding and evaluating the ways in which our financing activities impact on nature. It also includes the ways in which the organisation is dependent on nature and functioning ecosystems.\n\nCollaboration both within and across industries is essential to this transition. Barclays is pleased to be a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Forum. We also joined the Get Nature Positive initiative alongside other businesses to identify opportunities to take nature-positive action. Recognising deep interlinkages across environmental and social themes, it is necessary to view our work on nature and biodiversity, which includes our approach to deforestation and human rights on page 78, in tandem with our work on climate as summarised on pages 100 to 101.\n\nBarclays has relationships with customers and clients across a wide range of sectors and geographies, who face risks to their operations, supply chains and markets from biodiversity loss and land-use change. Recognising the importance of this agenda, we are developing our understanding and evaluating the Group's environmental impacts and dependencies as well as where we can support our clients through the transition to a nature-positive economy.\n\n## Nature-related risk in financing\n\nBarclays has engaged with a number of emerging methodologies to assess nature-related impacts and dependencies at a portfolio level. In 2021, Barclays contributed to initial developments of the Natural Capital Finance Alliance's ENCORE biodiversity module which supports financial institutions to better understand biodiversity-related impacts of their portfolios and we are part of an industry user group working to develop an approach to assess naturerelated risks and opportunities relevant to financial institutions.\n\nWe intend to do more to assess and minimise negative impacts of our financing activities on nature. We have included financing restrictions that seek to address biodiversity risk within our position statements on Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands, and Climate Change.\n\nFurther to the work that began in 2020 in relation to identifying biodiversity and ecosystems as a critical area within our PRB pilot impact assessment, we continue to assess any associated impacts within our portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, see our position statements on the Barclays ESG Resource Hub at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/\n\nFurther details on our position statements can be found in the non-financial information statement on pages 49 to 50.\n\n## Get Nature Positive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, Barclays joined Get Nature Positive, an initiative led by the UK Government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Council for Sustainable Business.

We recognise the importance of the integrity of natural capital and we aim to ensure any nature-based offsets we purchase are issued under high quality standards and certifications and where possible, have additional environmental and social co-benefits.\n\nBiodiversity and nature-related financing present significant opportunities for the financial sector given the large requirement for capital to protect and restore biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Barclays can contribute to meeting this gap through our green and sustainable finance targets. These targets include financing related to biodiversity, such as 'sustainable food, agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and fisheries' in addition to financing that tracks against Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14, Life Under Water as well as SDG 15, Life on Land.\n\n## Blue Marine Foundation\n\nThe first year of the donation has included supporting the establishment of a fully no-take zone nearly the size of France in Ascension Island's waters, securing the protection of 300km 2 of seabed and kelp forests on the south coast of the UK, developing a new online educational platform to communicate the link between ocean health and climate change, and developing thought leadership in conservation finance, blue carbon and oceanic climate change.\n\nBarclays completed the first year of our three-year partnership with the Blue Marine Foundation (BLUE) to support them in delivering their goal of ensuring that at least 30% of the global ocean is effectively protected and the other 70% sustainably managed by 2030.\n\nRecognising the critical links between the ocean and the issues of climate change and biodiversity loss, this partnership is an example of how collaboration between NGOs and the corporate sector can bring together new opportunities for nature-positive action and seek to make progress against the gap in financing for climate and biodiversity solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the Blue Marine Foundation can be found at: bluemarinefoundation.com/\n\nBLUE's Maldives Project Manager, Shaha, swimming above seagrass.

Using technology, with assistance for vulnerable customers and those that need help, we are creating space and time for more complex financial conversations.\n\nThe banking services we provide and the manner in which they are delivered continue to evolve, driven by the changing needs of our customers. How we bank today is unrecognisable from 50 years ago. Customers are demanding more convenient, simpler ways to bank that fit their lives. We are continuing to help deliver these solutions at pace.\n\nThis ongoing change in behaviour means that as the number of bricks and mortar branches has reduced over time, we are also investing in new, more flexible ways of serving customers better in the long run. These include temporary and flexible banking pop-ups in community spaces, libraries and companies, and the introduction of mobile banking vans.\n\nAlongside our investment in technology enabling close to 11 million digital customers to access tools and products whenever they need them, these new destinations will transform everyday banking by making it easier and more convenient, while keeping Barclays at the heart of the community, on a long-term sustainable basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are working to ensure that customers who rely on cash; in particular, older and more vulnerable customers can still access it and get the support they need. This is why we have joined forces with our competitor banks and consumer groups, the Post Office and LINK, in an agreement on shared services helping to ensure long-term cash availability across the UK.\n\nThe industry will work together to deploy these services on a shared cost basis, which will include shared Banking Hubs and ATMs. In this way we will help to ensure that no one is left behind, with every person and small business being guaranteed reasonable access to cash in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn the future, as branch closures are announced, LINK will independently assess remaining cash provision against agreed industry standards, and where required, in conjunction with local communities, will propose new shared services.\n\nAlongside these changes, we are continually investing in multi-skilled training for our colleagues so they are better able to serve customers in ways that meet their needs today as well as breaking down internal barriers to enable more queries to be resolved by the first person a customer speaks to at Barclays, whichever way the customer chooses to contact us.\n\n## Basic current account\n\nOur basic current accounts provide individuals who may not be eligible for a standard account access to banking including; over the counter services, access to ATMs, and digital banking and free text alerts to manage finances.\n\nSince 2015, we have been offering our basic current account, which meets HM Treasury's Memorandum of Understanding on basic bank accounts. There were over 642,000 Barclays basic current accounts open at the end of 2021.\n\nAccess to a transactional bank account enables consumers to benefit from bill reductions through paying by Direct Debit and access to cheaper goods and services on the internet, which goes some way towards alleviating the poverty premium. If their circumstances change, customers on the basic current account are able to apply for a standard Barclays current account at any time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Community accounts\n\n## Digital accessibility\n\nWe also provide free banking to over 115,000 small not-for-profit organisations through our community accounts.\n\nWe aim to ensure that our digital services are easy to see, hear, understand and use for all customers, including those with disabilities. AbilityNet (a leading UK disability charity) has independently accredited for accessibility the key journeys of our online banking website and mobile app during 2021.\n\nWe seek to deliver digital services and workplace tools that promote disability inclusion and meet accessibility requirements set out in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA level.\n\nWe have strengthened accessibility requirements within our procurement processes, recognising the importance of partnering with suppliers and giving clear expectations.",

This included over 48,000 first time buyers who we helped get onto the property ladder, up 92% from 2020, and the highest number in our history. We have continued to support customers with their home buying needs and have had a record performance in mortgage completions during 2021.\n\nOur Family Springboard Mortgage allows homebuyers to secure a mortgage with the help of family or friends, while allowing the 'helper' to earn interest at the same time. Homebuyers can obtain a mortgage with only a small deposit or even no deposit. This helps them buy their property sooner than they would otherwise be able to, provided that their helper (typically parents) deposit 10% of the property purchase price in a Helpful Start account for five years. Subsequently the funds are released back to the helper.\n\n## Financial inclusion in our US consumer business\n\nThe Act instructs the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operation (Section 802).\n\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) is a US federal law designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to help meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low and moderate-income neighbourhoods. Congress passed the Act in 1977 to reduce discriminatory credit practices against low-income neighbourhoods, a practice known as red-lining.\n\nTo enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA compliance, and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions (Section 804).\n\nBarclays has predefined goals with specific performance targets that we must meet each year in order to be considered in compliance with CRA guidelines. Barclays in the US has not only met their respective requirements but exceeded the goals for 2021. Exceeding the CRA performance goals is evidence that Barclays is continuing to invest in the communities in which we live, work and serve.\n\nBarclays meets the CRA requirement by supporting and investing in local small businesses and non-profits. The success of the small businesses and non-profits are key to a thriving community.\n\nThe Barclays Bank Delaware (BBDE) Compliance function operates and maintains a comprehensive Fair Lending Compliance Management System (CMS).\n\nAs part of the CMS, BBDE employees and Board members receive Fair Lending training annually. The BBDE Board reviews and approves BBDE's Fair Lending Statement which communicates zero tolerance on discriminatory practices in BBDE. Upon Board approval, this Statement is communicated annually to all BBDE employees.\n\nBBDE including Barclays US Consumer Bank (USCB) is committed to fair and equitable treatment of all prospective and existing customers without regard to race, sex, colour, national origin, religion, age, marital status, disability, sexual orientation, military status, gender identity, familial status, limited English proficiency, receipt of public assistance income, and good faith exercise of rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. We believe Barclays' core values of Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellence, and Stewardship reflect our commitment to fair lending and fair treatment principles and practices. We strive to develop long-term relationships by providing products and services that meet customer needs, avoid causing customer detriment or harm, and place our customer's interests at the heart of our strategy, planning, and decision-making processes.\n\nIn what has been a particularly tough year for economic crime and scams across the industry, as scammers have exploited the COVID-19 pandemic; we have increased our efforts to tackle economic crime at all levels. We have supported UK Finance with their national Take Five campaign, to help keep the public safe through a multi-stage educational campaign, with content across our social media, email, in-app notifications and media outreach, we are working to arm our customers with the knowledge they need to spot a scam and prevent themselves from becoming a victim.\n\n## Economic crime and scams\n\nAdditionally, to help keep our customers safe, we've continued to invest millions of pounds in multi-layered security systems that protect against frauds and scams and implemented functionality across our channels to stop scams before our customers become victims. This includes 'Confirmation of Payee', an account name checking service that helps to make sure payments aren't sent to the wrong bank or building society account, helping to prevent fraudulent or scam payments, and App ID, which allows Barclays colleagues to verify to customers that they're a legitimate caller and not an impersonator by sending push notifications to the customer's Barclays App which includes the call handler's name.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Though our businesses are geographically diverse, nearly 90% of our third-party spend is concentrated in the UK and the US with many of our suppliers having their own extensive supply chains, we connect to thousands more businesses and employees worldwide.\n\nAlthough Barclays has sought to reduce the size of its supply chain over recent years which resulted in a reduction of our supplier numbers in 2021, our focus has been on establishing a preferred supplier list for products and services that ensures adequate geographical coverage and at the same time, creates opportunities for our diverse suppliers b which encompass small or medium-sized enterprises and diverse-owned c businesses.\n\nOur supply base is diverse across scale, ownership type and structure from privately-held start-ups to publicly-listed multinational corporations.\n\n## ESG in the supply chain\n\nWe aim to encourage transparency and inclusive cultures, without the opportunity for modern slavery to exist while reducing the environmental impact of our business.\n\nAs part of the Group's ESG strategy, we are focused on environmental and social responsibility in our supply chain, initially across three pillars of diversity and inclusion, the environment and modern slavery.\n\n## Third-party operational and reputational risk management\n\nSupplier relationships are assessed and managed based on the inherent risk posed to Barclays through provision of the services. We expect higher risk categories of suppliers to operate in accordance with our Third Party Code of Conduct (TPCoC). The Barclays Supplier Control Obligations (SCOs) and TPCoC are published on the Barclays website for all new and existing suppliers to view and are refreshed regularly to meet Barclays' current standards and the latest regulatory requirements.\n\nBarclays' expects our suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and standards within the geographies in which they operate.\n\nAdditionally, on an annual basis, suppliers categorised as higher risk must attest to their ongoing aim to meet the expectations placed upon them within the TPCoC and, where they are unable to meet these expectations, remediation must be progressed in order for the relationship with the supplier to remain in good standing.\n\nThe Barclays SCOs set forth expectations of suppliers considered Material Outsourcing, Important, High or Limited risk across several risk categories including Complaints, Data Privacy, End-User Developed Applications, Health and Safety, Information and Cyber Security, Payments Processing, People Screening, Physical Security, Records Management, Resilience and Technology risk, Data Management, Digital Accessibility and Transaction Operations.\n\nThe Barclays TPCoC is informed by the Global Reporting Initiative, an international set of voluntary standards, and sets forth our minimum expectations with regard to environmental management, human rights, diversity and inclusion, societal responsibility, product responsibility, whistleblowing and working in accordance with the Barclays Values. In instances where standards outlined in the TPCoC differ from local laws and customs, we expect suppliers to respect these standards within the context of the customs and the local laws of their specific geography.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b.   Spending between Barclays and diverse suppliers is considered first-tier spending. Spending between Barclays' first-tier suppliers that can trace subcontracted spend with diverse suppliers on Barclays-specific work is considered second-tier direct spending.\n- a.   Includes non-addressable spend and One Time Vendors (OTV).\n- c.   For Barclays, a diverse supplier is either diverse by size - a micro, small or medium-sized business - or diverse by ownership generally 51% owned, controlled and operated by ethnic minorities, women, LGBT+, military veterans, persons with disabilities or social enterprises.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## ESG: Social continued\n\nFor our higher risk suppliers, their adherence to the SCO and TPCoC is captured pre-contractually via a Pre-Contract Supplier Assurance Attestation (Pre-SAA). Any control gaps or weaknesses are captured in the Sourcing Risk Log which is submitted to the relevant subject matter expert who will opine on the appropriate course of action, based on the level of risk associated with the control gaps. Some of the gaps will be remediated before contract, some will be conditions of the contract and others will be accepted within the Barclays risk appetite and approved by the subject matter expert. Post-contractually, on an annual basis, Barclays seeks ongoing assurance from the supplier that SCO controls continue to be designed and operating effectively.\n\nAny control gaps or weaknesses identified are reviewed with the relevant Barclays Executive accountable for the supplier relationship and subject matter experts and remediation actions are agreed, monitored and tracked to completion.\n\nThe assurance approach used is agreed based on the inherent risk associated with the supplier or service(s) provided and may take the form of on-site testing, remote desktop testing or a supplier attestation, or any combination of these approaches.\n\nIn 2022, we will be strengthening our TPCoC for our higher risk ESG service providers. We are also evaluating how to strengthen the ESG requirements in our contractual and purchase order terms and conditions to be applied to all service providers regardless of risk rating.\n\nWe are adopting a staged approach to achieving this ambition, working with key service providers to establish and disclose GHG a emissions and help to set science-based GHG reduction targets b . Given the extent and diversity of our supply base, we will prioritise our work and will focus our efforts initially with those suppliers with more significant GHG emissions. By 2025, it is our aim that service providers covering 70% of Barclays' addressable spend will be reporting their GHG emissions and will have science-based plans in place.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion in our supply chain\n\nSince 2016 we have been working with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) to obtain greenhouse gas emissions data from our suppliers. In 2021 we achieved a 90% response rate from those suppliers invited to report their greenhouse gas emissions through CDP, which represents 48% of our addressable spend.\n\nBarclays believes that diversity and inclusion within the supplier portfolio expands our ability to attract and harness innovative, disruptive solutions in the market that complement our own capabilities, while simultaneously creating economic opportunities for wider, under-represented segments of society. It's why we launched our first Global Supplier Diversity and Inclusion (GSDI) initiative in 2013.\n\nAs part of our GSDI initiative, in 2021, 8% of our global addressable spend was placed with small and medium-sized enterprises and diverse-owned businesses as measured by first- and second-tier direct spending. Ownership-diverse businesses are majority owned, controlled and operated by protected class groups, as defined by local governments, such as women, ethnic minorities, LGBT, veterans, servicedisabled veterans, persons with disabilities and for-profit social enterprises.\n\nIn support of the GSDI, Barclays is a corporate member of, and plays a leading role with, some of the most prominent domestic and international diverse supplier certification organisations including National Minority Supplier Development Council (nmsdc.org), Women's Business Enterprise National Council (wbenc.org), WeConnect International (weconnectinternational.org), National LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce (nglcc.org), National Veteran Owned Businesses Association (NaVoba.org), Minority Supplier Development UK (msduk.org.uk), Disability:IN (disabilityIn.org) and Social Enterprise UK (socialenterprise.org.uk).\n\nBy 2025, we are aiming to double our spend with Black and Women majority owned businesses, with overall spend with diverse-owned businesses growing to 10% of Barclays annual global addressable spend. In addition, the aim is for service providers which make up 70% of our addressable spend, to have a diversity and inclusion policy or standard in place by 2025.\n\nIn an effort to increase the amount of private and public growth capital made available to diverse-owned businesses, Barclays awarded $100,000 to the National Minority Supplier Development Council to assist in the creation of a new system of capital-access.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b.   Science-based targets are a set of goals developed by a business to provide it with a clear route to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. An emissions reduction target is defined as 'science-based' if it is developed in line with the scale of reductions required to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C (Paris Agreement). 2,000+ companies work with the Science Based Targets initiative.\n- a. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative is a multi-stakeholder partnership of businesses, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments, and others convened by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Launched in 1998, its mission is to develop internationally accepted greenhouse gas accounting and reporting standards for business and to promote their broad adoption.\n\n## Prompt Payment Code UK\n\nThe need to promptly pay our diverse suppliers became even more important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Barclays established a process to expedite the payments for diverse suppliers at this critical time. In 2021, Barclays made payments to them within an average of eight days from receipt of their invoice.\n\nPrompt payment is critical to the cash flow of every business, and especially to smaller businesses within the supply chain as cash flow issues are a major contributor to business failure. Barclays is a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code in the UK. We aim to pay our suppliers within clearly defined terms, and to help ensure there is a proper process for dealing with any issues that may arise. We measure prompt payment globally by calculating the percentage of third-party supplier spend paid within 45 days following invoice date, or receipt date if the invoice is received late (45 days from the invoice date and where a purchase order was raised ahead). The measurement applies against all invoices by value over a three-month rolling period for all entities where invoices are managed centrally.\n\nIn 2021, we achieved 90% (2020: 88%) on-time payment to our suppliers (by invoice value), exceeding our public commitment to pay 85% of suppliers on time (by invoice value).\n\n## Climate change initiatives in our supply chain\n\nThe Duty to Report on Payment Practices and Performance UK Legislation requires reporting on a six-month rolling average, by volume, where we measure percentage of payments made in line with contractual payment terms. Under this definition we paid 89% of UK invoices on time during 2021.\n\nAs part of our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, we are aiming to reduce emissions associated with the products and services we purchase. That starts with aligning our suppliers with the goals of the Paris Agreement.",

On a cumulative basis, by year-end 2021, we have facilitated \u00a3193.3bn \u0394 of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing since 2018, exceeding our target four years early.\n\nWe have also accelerated progress against our target to facilitate \u00a3100bn of green financing from 2018 to 2030, which is a sub-set of our target to facilitate \u00a3150bn of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing, focused on environmental use of proceeds and sustainability-linked criteria.\n\nSocial and environmental financing consists of labelled issuances, dedicated 'use of proceeds' financing, and financing for clients with an eligible business mix in relevant environmental and social categories. In contrast, sustainability-linked financing refers to general-purpose funding linked to specific sustainability performance metrics. Further details on our social and environmental criteria is available in the Barclays Sustainable Finance Framework within the ESG Resource Hub.\n\nWe continue to expand our sustainable finance offering through our specialist teams and to integrate sustainability into our service offering. There remains a very significant opportunity for Barclays across social and environmental financing, both through lending from our balance sheet and origination through the capital markets.\n\nWe facilitated \u00a369.2bn \u0394 of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing in 2021, up 14% from \u00a360.9bn in 2020.\n\n## Facilitate \u00a3150bn of social, environmental and sustainability-linked financing\n\nDebt issuance was the largest product category again this year accounting for 74% of the total (2020: 81%).

Sourced via Dealogic.\n\nAlthough relatively new, we have seen issuers aligning their financing commitments with their social targets, such as gender diversity, affordable housing and access to essential services. For example, we have seen significant growth in the sustainable capital markets with regard to the UK social housing sector, with supply supported by global capital flows, as well as increased domestic investor appetite.\n\nOur environmental financing consists of labelled, 'use of proceeds' and business mix financing in environmental categories. In 2021, it grew by 53% to \u00a322.6bn \u0394 versus \u00a314.8bn in 2020 reflecting the strong increase in demand for environmental financing and our strategy to work with our clients and customers to help facilitate their transitions towards a low-carbon economy.

In April 2021, we expanded the eligibility criteria of our green home mortgage to include any new build properties meeting energy efficiency requirements. Previously the proposition was available for properties built by a panel of 14 house builders. In January 2022, we expanded our green home mortgages further extending the eligibility to customers purchasing a new build energy efficient buy-to-let property.\n\nBarclays was one of the first UK lenders to launch a green mortgage product in 2018, and to date we have completed over \u00a31bn in green home mortgages.\n\nFollowing the significant growth in green mortgages, we continue to look at ways we can give customers more options to make sustainable choices when it comes to their home. Green mortgages are currently only available for the purchase of new build homes, so older homes are not eligible for a Barclays green home mortgage. We know that, for the UK to achieve its ambition of becoming net zero by 2050, the residential housing stock needs to be made more energy efficient, and this means homeowners need to retrofit their homes with energy efficient measures. We are working to explore how we can best help our customers take steps towards making their homes more energy efficient.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Barclays Green Home Mortgages can be found at: barclays.co.uk/mortgages/ green-home-mortgage/\n\nFurther details on Barclays Buy-To-Let Mortgages can be found at: barclays.co.uk/mortgages/green-buyto-let-mortgage/\n\n<!-- image -->",

This global team offers a broad range of ESG capital market product types and delivers across multiple client segments to help clients finance their sustainability journeys and formalise their sustainability commitments. The team focuses on underwriting and structuring green, social and sustainability use of proceeds bonds, and sustainability-linked bond issuance. The team continued to execute a range of landmark transactions in 2021 such as helping the UK Government issue its \u00a310bn green bond.\n\nThe Sustainable and Impact Banking team is a dedicated sector coverage team focused on advising and raising capital for emerging climate technology companies across four key verticals: clean energy, sustainable materials and recycling, food and agriculture tech and water. The team also advises our existing banking clients on their energy transition via our ESG advisory. Regular interaction with ESG funds and other stakeholders inform our client dialogue.\n\nThe Sustainable Product Group focuses on increasing sustainability related dialogue with our Corporate Bank clients as well as delivering a broad range of green and sustainable banking products. In addition to corporate and project financing in 2021, the team has expanded our Corporate Bank's offering to include green and sustainability-linked trade, debt and fund financing products. The Sustainable Product Group offer Corporate Bank clients connectivity with other teams in the Corporate and Investment Bank and wider Group.\n\n## Corporate Bank Sustainable Product Group\n\n## ESG across our Research teams\n\nThe team aims to combine their existing deep understanding of sectors and businesses to help drive forward-looking ESG investment insights, deliver expertise and that the latest technical sustainability knowledge is informing our research in conjunction with the wider global research department.\n\nBarclays Research has made significant investments to grow its ESG research capabilities and thought leadership. We hired a Global Head of Cross Asset ESG Research at the beginning of year who built a new ESG Research team of subject matter experts to support the consistent integration of ESG and sustainability considerations across all our research and investment recommendations. Our approach to ESG research is differentiated in two ways, yielding much broader-based engagement with ESG issues and higher quality insights for our investor clients.\n\nThis aims to enable the critical assessment and sourcing of the most appropriate ESG information and data and drives in-depth materiality assessments in collaboration with coverage analysts. There have been around 350 ESG-focused research reports published in 2021, and also over 650 bottom-up, company-specific ESG profiles published to date.\n\n## Treasury green activities\n\nOur expectation that topics such as climate change, biodiversity as well as other sustainability themes and specific ESG attributes will continue to grow in importance, and that the global momentum behind ESG investing will continue at pace, making it an essential requisite for a large and growing number of investors.\n\nBarclays Treasury plays a key role in enabling Barclays to meet its climate goals by allocating, managing and governing its financial resources effectively.\n\nWe believe that integrating environmental considerations into our financial resource management by partnering with, and encouraging business areas to advance strategic climate objectives is a key lever in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. For example,\n\nTreasury currently provides funding incentives for green asset origination, and is also developing our approach to incorporating green considerations in our capital management and stress testing.\n\n## Strategic green transactions\n\nIn partnership with the Sustainability and ESG team, Treasury supports the development and management of ESG governance frameworks. For example, Treasury structured the Barclays Green Issuance Framework and organises the day-to-day implementation such as facilitating the Barclays International and Barclays UK Green Bond Committees, the bodies with delegated authority for approving green liability programmes and associated issuance allocation.\n\nTreasury partners with businesses to originate, structure and execute strategic green transactions in order to support climate objectives. This includes strategic investments into innovative companies developing new technologies which can support our customers and clients in adapting to climate change challenges through the Sustainable Impact Capital Programme; for further details see page 72. We also invest in and hold green bonds within our liquid asset buffer, and have issued MREL from Barclays PLC where the proceeds of issuance are used to support Eligible Assets as defined in the Barclays Green Issuance Framework.\n\nOther examples include the structuring of innovative liability programmes and bespoke transactions such as the Green Structured Notes (GSN) and the StatECA Repack Platform to provide differentiated green investment opportunities for our investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on our treasury green activities can be found at: home.barclays/greenbonds\n\n## Green Structured Notes\n\n- \u25a0 GSN combines a derivative style payoff (equitylinked to green indices) with the proceeds of issuance being used to support Eligible Assets as defined in the Barclays Green Issuance Framework,\n\nThe GSN Programme was launched in 2021 as a partnership between Equities and Treasury to expand our green product offering for clients.\n\n- \u25a0 the proceeds of the GSNs will be used to support a portfolio of Eligible Assets which are originated by Barclays Bank PLC in the ordinary course of its business, and will be verified by a third-party verification agent. Any GSN proceeds in excess of the amount of available Eligible Assets from time-to-time will be invested in cash and shortterm, liquid investments until additional Eligible Assets become available,\n- \u25a0 the main benefit of the GSN is the ability to offer Investors a differentiated green investment opportunity whereby both the embedded derivative (on the equity-linked underlying indices) and use of proceeds of the issuance meet environmental objectives, and\n- \u25a0 the indices utilised in the GSN have been selected in accordance with the Barclays Green Index Selection Principles,\n- \u25a0 the offering leverages Barclays' existing Green Bond issuance capability and Barclays' experience in equity derivatives.",

Eligible loans are repackaged into tradable notes; generally highly rated by credit rating agencies which are used as eligible collateral for other transactions.\n\nWe view responsible investing as an important part of our investment strategy. This involves engagement and voting, as well as incorporating ESG factors (amongst others) into investment analysis and decisions. This assists us with our efforts in managing and mitigating ESG risks which can materially impact long-term company and portfolio returns.\n\nOur Discretionary Portfolio Management a offering sits at the core of the Private Bank's long-term strategy. The analysis of ESG factors forms an important part of our investment due diligence for all of our Private Bank discretionary investment strategies globally b . We believe that ESG provides insights into the operational quality of a business and its ability to mitigate against risks to future cash flow, and thereby helps us to make better investment decisions.\n\n## Discretionary Portfolio Management\n\nLaunched in 2018, our Sustainable discretionary strategy invests in companies that generate revenues from products and services that help to address the United Nation's SDGs.\n\n## Engagement and voting\n\nOur engagement with corporates takes place through our partnership with EOS at board and senior executive level, covering a range of topics such as climate change, executive pay, human rights and labour rights including modern slavery. We seek to highlight key ESG issues of concern, engaging investee companies on matters relevant to shareholder value and the wellbeing of stakeholders.\n\nThrough our partnership with EOS at Federated Hermes (EOS) since Q2 2021 in the UK, Barclays Private Bank has been embedding a comprehensive approach to stewardship, engaging and voting globally with corporates and key stakeholders, such as policymakers and regulators. EOS is a stewardship leader that helps long-term institutional investors around the world to meet their fiduciary responsibilities and become active owners of public companies.\n\nDuring the peak voting season in Q2 2021, through our partnership with EOS, we voted at 28 shareholder meetings, supporting management on 85% of the resolutions we voted on. This reflects our approach of promoting constructive dialogue with our investee companies by building long-term relationships to seek to influence ESG practices. We also engaged with companies held in our discretionary strategies on a range of ESG topics including strategy, risk and communication.\n\n## Wealth Management and Investments\n\nUltimately, we award an ESG rating for every fund that we recommend or invest in. As a result of these steps and more, Barclays Asset Management Ltd (BAML) has served as our signatory to the UN supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) for the last three years, and has achieved an 'A' score for investment modules in our last annual submission in relation to the PRI.\n\nWealth Management and Investments factors responsible investing into our discretionary portfolio and fund investment solutions. We aim to assess every active investment manager that we research for its ESG credentials. Examples of the areas that we assess include how ESG is incorporated at the group level within the fund management firms, how ESG risks and opportunities are considered in their investment processes and which personnel are focused on this topic. Additionally, we will endeavour to review the underlying companies that the external funds invest in to look to check those holdings are consistent with what we would expect having made these assessments of the fund managers' philosophy and processes.\n\nLeveraging our partnership with EOS, we engage with the underlying companies that we hold in our portfolios and we also exercise our proxy votes on the underlying equity holdings. Furthermore we support the aims of other ownership commitments, such as the UK Stewardship Code, of which we aim to become a signatory in 2022.\n\nWhile our policy is to apply the measures above across our investment solutions, for those clients seeking a product that explicitly targets positive environmental and social outcomes, we manage and offer a retail fund called the Barclays Multi-Impact Growth Fund. It brings together a range of external funds, in both equities and bonds, each of which focuses upon holding companies that aim to have a positive impact on either the environment or society.\n\n## Retail banking\n\nWe are working closely with our partners such as Barclays Partner Finance on key focus areas to help customers on their journey from education to implementing solutions. We are focusing on creating and curating opportunities to enable customers to improve the energy efficiency of their homes, tracking and offsetting their carbon footprint and making more sustainable choices in their day-to-day spending. By working collaboratively under a unified strategy across Barclays UK, we aim to further expand our green products and propositions to meet customers' aspirations.\n\nSustainability is a key focus area for Barclays UK. We want to help customers by creating opportunities for them to implement green changes. We are actively engaging with our retail customers to better understand how we can provide greener solutions to meet their needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\n- b.

        "page_content": "## ESG: Social and environmental financing continued\n\n## Managing impacts in lending and financing\n\nAppropriate management of environmental and social impacts helps to ensure the longevity of our business and our ability to serve our clients.\n\nWe recognise that we have a responsibility to proactively identify and address the adverse impacts that we may be linked to through the provision of financial services to our customers and clients.\n\n## Managing social and environmental risks\n\nOur assessment of environmental and social risks not only helps safeguard our reputation, ensuring longevity of the business but also enhances our ability to serve our clients and support them in improving their own sustainability practices and disclosures.\n\nSocial and environmental risks are governed and managed through our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), setting our strategic approach for risk management by defining standards, objectives and responsibilities for all areas of Barclays. The ERMF is complemented by a number of other frameworks, policies and standards, all of which are aligned to individual Principal Risks.\n\nOur Climate Change Statement sets out our approach to managing the impact of our climate-related activities. We have developed internal standards to reflect these positions in more detail, including for Forestry and Agricultural Commodities, World Heritage and Ramsar Wetlands and Defence and Security. These standards sit under the management of Reputation risk in the ERMF. These standards determine our approach to climate change and relevant sensitive sectors and are considered as part of our existing transaction origination, review and approval process.\n\n## Enhanced Due Diligence\n\nAll in-scope clients in these sub-sectors must be assessed annually via a detailed due diligence questionnaire, which is used to evaluate their performance on a range of environmental and social issues, and may be supplemented by a review of client policies/procedures, further client engagement and adverse media checks as appropriate. This annual review generates an Environmental and Social Impact (ESI) risk rating (low, medium, high), which in turn determines whether further review and client engagement may be required throughout the year.\n\nOur standards include an enhanced due diligence approach for certain clients, including clients operating in energy sub-sectors covered by our Climate Change Statement. This includes all clients involved in thermal coal, oil sands, arctic projects and hydraulic fracturing ('fracking').\n\nFor clients with a medium or high ESI rating further risk assessment is undertaken prior to execution of transactions with those clients.\n\nWe undertook 903 reviews in 2021, being a combination of annual due diligence reviews and individual transaction reviews, slightly less than the 912 we undertook in 2020. The number of reviews for 2021 reflects the extension of the annual review process to additional sectors, which is offset by a reduction in transaction referrals for lower risk clients.\n\nThis enhanced due diligence approach has been extended to clients in-scope of our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities standard and our Defence and Security standard.\n\n## Escalation and decision\n\n- \u25a0 approve the transaction or relationship,\n\nWhere client relationships or transactions have a high or medium ESI risk rating following an enhanced due diligence review, they are then escalated to the appropriate business unit review committee for consideration (and in relation to execution of a transaction with those clients, a decision on whether to proceed). Should the front office business team, the Sustainability and ESG team and/or Climate Risk team believe the issues are sufficiently material, these would be escalated to the Climate Transaction Review Committee (CTRC) or Group Reputation Risk Committee (GRRC) as appropriate, for more senior consideration and decision. Both of these Committees include representation from the Group Executive Committee. The CTRC or GRRC may make the following determinations:\n\n- \u25a0 reject the transaction or relationship,\n- \u25a0 escalate the review of the transaction or relationship to the Barclays Group CEO.\n- \u25a0 approve the transaction or relationship, subject to prescribed modifications, or\n\n## Monitoring\n\nAs part of our management of environmental and social risks, we may require further client engagement calls in relation to the specific environmental and social risks that we have identified as part of our enhanced due diligence process. We have used these calls as an opportunity to gain a more detailed understanding of the risks and challenges that the client is facing and to better understand any climate transition plan that they may have.\n\nWe intend to continue our work with clients in key sectors, believing it is better to be engaging with clients in relation to the transition, rather than simply walking away from financing for these sectors. We recognise there may be companies or particular activities that cannot transition over time, and in such cases we believe those clients will find it increasingly difficult to access markets for financing, including through Barclays.\n\nEnvironmental risk is regarded as a credit risk driver, and is considered within our in credit risk assessment process. The Climate risk team is responsible for advising on the environmental and climate-related credit risks to Barclays associated with particular transactions. Environmental risks in credit are governed under the Client Assessment and Aggregation Policy, Environmental Risk Standard and Nuclear Industry Risk Standards. These standards are embedded within the overall ERMF.\n\n## Environmental credit risks\n\nOver the years, we have developed detailed industryspecific risk guidance notes covering more than 50 environmentally and socially sensitive activities across 10 different sectors to inform our approach. Sectors covered include, for example, Agriculture and Fisheries, Oil and Gas, Mining and Metals, and Utilities and Waste Management.\n\nThese briefing notes are available to colleagues in business development and credit risk functions across the organisation, outlining the nature of environmental and social risks of which to be aware, as well as the factors which mitigate those risks.",

This year we augmented our due diligence approach for these clients by developing a detailed due diligence questionnaire against which we review these clients on an annual basis.\n\nBarclays recognises that deforestation is a key driver of climate change and biodiversity loss and is frequently linked with significant adverse human rights impacts. We are a signatory to the New York Declaration on Forests and its objectives of ending deforestation by 2030. We seek to support clients that promote sustainable land management practices while respecting the rights of workers and local communities.\n\nClients engaged in forestry, palm oil or soy production are assessed for compliance with the requirements in our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement and a number of other environmental and social issues, such as their zero\n\n## Human rights\n\nIn 2021, we have initiated a strategic exercise to identify the salient human rights risks associated with our client financing portfolio. Over time, this will enable us to\n\nBarclays operates in accordance with the International Bill of Human Rights and takes account of other internationally accepted human rights standards, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We respect and promote human rights in our own operations through our employment policies and practices and our supply chain through screening and engagement.\n\nIn recognition of the growing concerns around the impact of soy and beef supply chains on deforestation and land conservation in South America, this year we have supplemented our enhanced due diligence reviews of relevant agribusiness clients to include client engagement calls specifically focused on this topic.\n\ndeforestation commitments, sustainability certification coverage, and their adherence to the principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC); to better understand how they are appropriately managing their material environmental and social impacts.\n\nWe have used these calls as an opportunity to gain a more detailed understanding of the risks and challenges in the region and better understand these clients' ongoing supplier traceability and monitoring activities. This engagement should allow us to better support these clients in addressing their supply chain deforestation risks and to encourage the improvement of these activities over time where together we have identified opportunities to do so.\n\nfocus our client due diligence efforts and disclosures on the issues that pose the greatest risk to people. We intend to provide more information on this assessment and our plan for enhancing our approach to identification and management of salient human rights risks in future reports.\n\nWe are working to embed human rights considerations into our position statements and related due diligence approach for clients operating in sectors with elevated environmental and social impacts. For example, we include specific questions around respect for Indigenous Peoples' rights, health and safety and\n\nprovision of security into our due diligence questionnaires for clients in energy subsectors such as fracking and oil sands which are covered under our Climate Change Statement.\n\nOutside of our established sector statements we are working to proactively monitor for events and developments globally that may present new human rights risks and work to investigate our potential exposure to these. For example, this year we identified renewable energy supply chains and the surveillance technology sector as two areas that are increasingly linked with human rights risks such as forced labour. In response, we initiated a portfolio review of our exposure to companies involved in these sectors in a region with heightened exposure to these risks. We subsequently conducted due diligence on identified clients and are engaging with a selection of prioritised clients to further assess their risk management approach and evaluate whether they are taking appropriate steps to address these risks.\n\nIn 2021, we established a tailored due diligence questionnaire for clients covered by our Forestry and Agricultural Commodities Statement. In recognition of the potential impacts that the production of commodities such as timber products or palm oil may have on Indigenous Peoples, through this questionnaire we will assess each client's approach to consulting with these groups. We will evaluate whether their approach is consistent with the principles of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) in order to gain assurance that the client will respect the rights of Indigenous People potentially impacted by its operations.\n\nBarclays does not tolerate modern slavery, human trafficking or forced labour. We are committed to trying to identify and seeking to address these risks across our value chain. We have previously identified the manufacture of ICT equipment as an area of elevated modern slavery risk in our supply chain, and this year we conducted an enhanced review of ICT suppliers to further understand and address this risk. We developed a bespoke labour rights due diligence questionnaire and sent this to 95% by spend of our ICT equipment\n\nsuppliers. A number of suppliers were then prioritised for further review based on our assessment of their risk profile and risk management approach and in 2022, we will engage with these suppliers with a view to support them in improving their approach to addressing modern slavery risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBarclays Group Statement on Modern Slavery can be found at: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resourcehub/reporting-and-disclosures/\n\n## Barclays' statements and policy positions\n\n- \u25a0 Climate Change\n\nOur statements and policy positions include:\n\n- \u25a0 Forestry and Agricultural Commodities\n- \u25a0 Environmental Risk in Lending\n- \u25a0 World Heritage Sites and Ramsar Wetlands\n- \u25a0 Soft Commodities\n- \u25a0 Human Rights\n- \u25a0 Defence Sector\n- \u25a0 Modern Slavery\n- \u25a0 Data Protection\n- \u25a0 Financial Crime\n- \u25a0 Donations\n- \u25a0 Ta x\n- \u25a0 Resilience\n- \u25a0 Code of Conduct (The Barclays Way)\n- \u25a0 Health, Safety and Welfare\n- \u25a0 Third-Party Code of Conduct\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Barclays statements and policy positions can be found at: home. barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/ statements-and-policy-positions/",

Together with more formal policies and practices, this provides a clear path towards achieving a positive and dynamic culture within the Group.\n\n' In challenging times such as these, it is more important than ever that we conduct ourselves in the right way. The Barclays Way sets out the standards of behaviour we should all aspire to in our professional lives. It is a guiding light for everyone in Barclays, helping us to make the right decisions every day.\n\nOur commitment to being a responsible business includes ensuring that:\n\n- \u25a0 that we treat our customers fairly and that the products and services we deliver are transparent and responsible,\n- \u25a0 we conduct ourselves in line with The Barclays Way, our Code of Conduct, to create the best possible working environment for our colleagues,\n- \u25a0 we operate in line with relevant laws and regulations including those applicable to financial crime, and\n\nOur Code of Conduct reflects the trust that millions of people place in us every day. We know that trust is earned by repeatedly doing the right thing. We believe the best way to build that trust is to invest in our culture and support our people in the choices they make every day, with guidance and policies that help them do this.\n\n- \u25a0 we safeguard the data that has been entrusted to us.\n\nThat starts with our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and is locked into our organisation through The Barclays Way, the touchstone for everyone in Barclays on the standard of conduct we expect, setting an unequivocal tone from the top about who we are and what we stand for.\n\nThe Barclays Way was launched in 2013, replacing a number of existing codes of conduct with a single document. It governs our way of working across our business globally and constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues' working relationships, specifically but not exclusively with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments, regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community.\n\nIt is aligned to the Code of Professional Conduct, published by the Chartered Banker Professional Standards Board, which sets out the ethical and professional attitudes and behaviours expected of bankers. Barclays subscribes to this code and is committed to embedding its broad principles into our business.\n\nWe apply a range of criteria, over and above financial considerations, aimed at building a sustainable, strong and profitable business for the long term and adding value to our business relationships and the broader communities in which we live and work. We provide guidance across all key stakeholder groups, including servicing our customers and clients, promoting respect, diversity and performance in the workplace, maintaining strong governance, robust controls and strict ethical standards.\n\nThe Barclays Way includes information and guidance on how employees are expected to behave and take personal accountability for making decisions.\n\nThe Barclays Way also includes advice and guidance on speaking up and raising concerns. It is important for the success of Barclays, and for the safety and wellbeing of our customers, clients and colleagues, that we encourage a culture that supports speaking up when things aren't as they should be. All colleagues are required to undertake training on the Barclays Way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\nThe Barclays Way Code of Conduct is available at: home.barclays/citizenship/the-way-we-do-business/ code-of-conduct/\n\n\u00ae Net Promoter, Net Promoter System, Net Promoter Score, NPS and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems, Inc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBar\n\ncla\n\ny",

While our culture helps us reduce the impact of poor conduct on our customers, we also do not intend to repeat the errors of the past.\n\nOur most senior leaders spend significant time setting the right tone at Barclays and our Purpose and Values are now deeply embedded in their messages. The Barclays Way sets out the standards and behaviour all employees must demonstrate and guides the execution of our business. We also strengthen our culture with clear and effective controls. We continue investing to enhance our controls to support our commitment to conducting all activities with integrity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details of the Board's role in embedding our Culture, Purpose, Values and Mindset, please refer to page 148 of the Directors' Report.\n\nConduct risks that may arise due to a particular strategy, business model or activity, or any potential regulatory, market or industry changes; and (iii) the Delivered Risk Assessment (DRA) assesses the risks that a change initiative may create once delivered.\n\nThe governance of Conduct risk within the Group is fulfilled through management committees and forums operated by the first and second lines of defence with clear escalation and reporting lines to the Board. The Barclays Group and Barclays Bank Group Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for the oversight of the Conduct Risk Profile. The risk committees' responsibilities include the identification and discussion of any emerging Conduct risks exposures in their respective entities.\n\nThe governance of Conduct risk within the Group is fulfilled through management committees and forums operated by the first and second lines of defence, with clear escalation and reporting lines to the Board. Barclays Internal Audit (BIA) provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of Conduct risk management to the Board and senior management.\n\n## Managing Conduct risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 140 and 147 in the Directors' report in addition to pages 214, 223 and 288 in the risk review section for more information on how the Group defines, manages and mitigates Conduct risks.\n\n## Product design and review risk\n\nWe have a process that supports the Group in the approval and implementation of New and Amended Products and Approval process (known as the NAPA Process, set out in the Barclays NAPA Policy and Standards). This process outlines the requirements and risk assessment standards that must be met to help ensure that new and amended products and services are appropriately designed prior to their launch.\n\nIt is important that the design of our products and services meets the needs of clients, customers, markets as well as being aligned with Barclays' policies. We do this by operating two processes, which together form our product design and review risk framework.\n\nIn addition we have a complementary process that reviews the existing portfolio of products and services throughout their lifecycle (known as the Product Review Process, set out in the Barclays Product Review Policy and Standard). This process considers information about the performance and operation of the product or service through a conduct lens.\n\nWherever a product or service is found to be outside appetite, the product or service owner must seek to ensure actions are taken to address it. These actions are validated by functional areas, including Legal and Compliance.\n\n## The Barclays Mindset\n\nOur Mindset acts as an operating manual for how to get things done at Barclays. It focuses on three key elements that are core to our success - Empower, Challenge and Drive. Our research shows that when we demonstrate behaviours aligned to these three elements, outcomes are better, colleagues are more engaged and they are more likely to stay longer to build their career at Barclays.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details, see page 29 in the Strategic Report for more information on the Barclays Mindset.\n\n## Organisation and structure\n\nThe Conduct Risk Management Framework (CRMF) outlines how the Group manages and measures its Conduct risk profile. The Group Chief Compliance Officer is accountable for developing, maintaining and overseeing the CRMF. This includes defining and owning the relevant Conduct risk policies which detail the control objectives, principles and other core requirements for the activities of the Group. It is the responsibility of the first line of defence to establish controls to manage its performance and assess conformance to these policies and controls.  A selection of tools are used to manage and assess Conduct risk, including: (i) the Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) is the Group-wide approach for businesses to identify and regularly assess material risks and their  associated controls, in order to mitigate these risks and reduce the likelihood and/or severity of losses to Barclays; (ii) the Strategic Risk Assessment (SRA) focuses on non-financial risks and is the tool used to annually identify potential forward-looking",

The improvements covered both the design and operation of the process and have resulted in an enhanced product and design review control environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk Committees review, on behalf of their respective Boards, the management of Conduct risk and the Conduct risk profile for their respective entities.\n\nPlease refer to the report of the BPLC Board Risk Committee on pages 202 to 203 and the reports of the BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Risk Committees within the BBPLC and BBUKPLC 2021 Annual Reports available at home.barclays/annualreport for more information.\n\n## Customer communications\n\n- \u25a0 communications are sufficient, targeted and distributed to recipients whom Barclays knows or reasonably believes may stand to benefit from the communication, and are communicated in a manner and style that will be understood by the average recipient (or likely recipient),\n\nIt is important that our engagement with our customers is open and honest and that we treat them fairly to avoid foreseeable harm and to make sure they are not exploited or misled. Barclays continues to take steps to ensure that our customers' needs and priorities are understood before making recommendations and that the communications we provide allow informed decisions to be made. We work to achieve this through a number of controls which focus on ensuring our customers receive clear information in order to understand the risks and benefits of the products we offer. For example:\n\n- \u25a0 communications are withdrawn from further circulation when they are no longer accurate or fit for purpose, and\n- \u25a0 customers do not receive inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Barclays International\n\nRole modelling and driving a strong conduct culture is embedded throughout Barclays International (BI) from the senior leadership through to the businesses which comprise of Consumer, Cards and Payments and the Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB). The Barclays Way, Values and Mindset set out the standards and behaviour all employees must demonstrate and guides the execution of our business. Managing Conduct risk is an integral part of our strategic and financial planning, new business and product approval, risk assessments, performance management, promotion, remuneration and all other key decision-making processes. A CIB Balanced Scorecard is in place to measure how we are delivering for our four primary stakeholder groups: customers and clients, Shareholders, Colleagues and Society. The Scorecard is owned and reviewed by the CIB management team with regular updates published to all staff.\n\nIn these ways we look to ensure that customers and clients are put at the heart of everything we do; we recognise when customer detriment may have occurred and we undertake appropriate activity,\n\nAs well as business level controls and frameworks, individual accountability is also at the heart of the way that we manage our Conduct risk. Senior managers are individually accountable within their areas of responsibility for owning and managing Conduct risk, and any individual performing a role which requires certification, registration, permission or approval must have those in place before they engage in any regulated activities. In order to maintain these approvals, the individuals must undergo continuous education, additional mandatory training, fitness and propriety attestations, or additional requirements in their local jurisdictions, which are monitored in line with the individual accountability standard, in order to ensure that they carry out their role in line with the Barclays CRMF.\n\nincluding following complaints handling and redress procedures, designed to ensure our clients are put back in the position they should have been in. By doing these things we look to ensure that we deploy finance responsibly to champion sustainability and innovation across our businesses both now and in the future.\n\nWhile we apply the CRMF across all of our businesses, the broad range of markets, products, and clients around the world necessitates differing areas of focus for each business when managing its Conduct risk. For example, in addition to the group wide NAPA and Product Review processes, the CIB as well as the Private Bank operate enhanced Product Governance Frameworks, recognising the complex nature of our products and markets, in the businesses which review new and amended products and service proposals, ensuring changes are assessed from a client, conduct, operational and risk perspective.\n\nWe operate a broad range of products in BI which include: investment products and advice for our Private Bank clients supported by sales quality standards to help ensure we understand our clients' risk profiles, circumstances, investment needs and objectives; Transaction Banking products which need to be built robustly and operate effectively to meet the needs of our Corporate Banking clients; and Markets, Banking or BI Treasury products tailored in line with our specific client base, considering conduct and suitability by focusing on product features, distribution strategies and governance frameworks.\n\nBelow are some further examples of how specific Conduct risks relevant to our different businesses, are managed as part of the CRMF, above and beyond the risk themes that apply across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Barclays International businesses are carried on by BBPLC and its subsidiaries, as well as by certain other entities within the Group. For information regarding BBPLC Board governance and activities, please refer to the BBPLC Annual Report 2021 available at home.barclays/annualreport for more information.\n\nOur processes include a review of relevant communications which are supported by the Compliance, Privacy and Legal functions to help ensure we meet both internal customer engagement standards and we are compliant with external regulations. Furthermore annual mandatory training is completed by marketing colleagues. The training covers key customer and brand standards along with the role and key policies set by external regulators e.g. regulatory requirements may require communications to be provided that are accessible to customers, or provide customers with the option to 'opt out'.\n\nBarclays recognises that customer detriment may occur as a result of our error, actions or inactions, and that we must undertake appropriate activity designed to ensure our customers are put back in the position they would have been in had the issue not occurred.\n\n## Remediation and redress\n\nRemediation can be proactive, where we have identified the issue ourselves (for example through identifying a pattern in customer complaints), or reactive, where identified by a third party such as a regulator of Barclays.\n\nWhere it is appropriate, Barclays works to ensure the operation of consistent principles for remediation which includes timely notification to the relevant regulatory bodies.",

This provides an ongoing product review process, which promotes the delivery of products to compatible end investors on a direct and indirect basis.\n\nThe Retail Distribution Forum (RDF) are regional forums that cover APAC, EMEA and the US that consider conduct and suitability by focusing on product features, distribution strategies and the governance frameworks that apply to Retail Structured Products. There are further quarterly mandatory meetings to review all approvals in the previous quarter, provide an upcoming view of future meetings and a regulatory update.\n\nIn addition, the Forum has oversight of supplementary point of sale and post-sale processes and controls defined by each business and tailored in line with their specific client base and products offered. The Forum provides review, challenge and guidance and facilitates the consistent application and information sharing between the Markets, Banking and BI Treasury Businesses. This aims to improve governance in line with the organisation's overall risk management framework.\n\nThe Indirect Retail Distributor framework is part of the toolkit supporting issuance of Retail Structured Products and sets out requirements for initial and ongoing due diligence to help ensure the distributors have appropriate procedures and governance for their products and target market focusing on good end-customer outcomes.\n\nIn 2021, the Corporate Bank continued to strengthen its overall Conduct risk governance. This has been achieved through quarterly risk reviews and reporting, enhancement of customer experience, ongoing enhancement of controls, robust product governance and specific action to serve the needs of vulnerable customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Corporate Bank\n\nThe Corporate Bank Controls Forum governs Conduct risk and control oversight. Additionally, to support our on-going Market Conduct obligations, Corporate Bank initiated a dedicated Market Conduct process optimisation initiative. This initiative enhances existing processes and establishes a dedicated Market Conduct Knowledge Centre for Corporate Bank colleagues.\n\nWithin the Transaction Banking business, we have simplified our payments, digital services and information tariffs. Our new tariff provides our customers with much clearer information allowing them to easily reconcile their charges. Relationship Bankers are able to guide clients where cheaper solutions may be available to them and can review pricing dependent on customer needs.\n\nThe development of new propositions is done in collaboration with customers through research, insight, data analytics and data science. The goal is to help ensure customer needs are at the core of our design principles. By leveraging the new product approval process, customer needs are embedded in the final product design. Corporate Bank runs the Business Change Control Forum that sets and governs the principles and standards for managing material change impacting products globally and is a precursor to the Group-wide new product approval process.\n\nConsistency in product governance is provided through the Product Lifecycle Programme, which standardises how products are created, managed and changed within the Corporate Bank. The goal is that the relevant products and associated processes are robust and operate effectively. In addition, this provides Product Managers with greater end-to-end oversight and effective tools to manage products through each phase of maturity.\n\nIn matters relating to sustainable products in the Corporate Bank, the Sustainable Product Group has been established as a full-time team acting as a centre of excellence for sustainability-related topics, reputational risk, governance and reporting and product innovation and origination. A senior member of the Sustainable Product Group chairs the Corporate Bank Sustainability Council to provide oversight of these activities and direction on product development and innovation priorities. Colleague training and dedicated customer communication plans are also being led by the Sustainable Product Group and the Group Sustainability and ESG team, which includes training calls and other collateral.\n\nWe feel the importance to address the needs of vulnerable customers and help to ensure that they are understood and staff have the right skills and capability to recognise and respond to their needs to make sure they are treated fairly, building on existing support for them. The Corporate Bank has reviewed FCA and other jurisdictional regulations and instigated annual training, best practice controls and processes. All of this is underpinned by a regular review of the control framework to help ensure that it remains fit for purpose and continues to respond to the needs of vulnerable customers. This further builds on existing Corporate Bank practices as a signatory to the Standards of Lending Practices, which provides protections for Small and Medium Enterprises.\n\nA European Client Task Force (ECTF) was established to enhance the European client experience through a series of initiatives. The ECTF addressed a variety of client journeys in the European franchise with the aim of detecting and executing on efficiency opportunities within client support, digital propositions and product capabilities. As a result of this work, the Corporate Bank should be able to provide tangible uplift to the client experience with key improvements in onboarding and account opening through to payment processing. Corporate Bank will continue to apply these principles of continuous incremental improvement towards our wider business and customer footprint.\n\n## Global Markets\n\nThe GMCC is an input from teams across Markets, spanning the Regulatory, Legal and Compliance functions. It is a collection of key conduct principles and ethical and legal behaviours to which all colleagues are expected to adhere to at all times. In this edition, there are updates taken from our Policies, Standards and Procedures that incorporate the industry standards and best practices that guide our Markets business globally. New content has been added relating to Sustainability, the LIBOR Transition, and Personal Relationships at work. The principles highlighted in the GMCC inform all our decisions and bolster our business by building and maintaining a reputation of dependability with clients and strengthening our ability to attract, retain and develop our colleagues. The GMCC outlines how Markets manages Conduct risks including, but not limited to, preserving confidentiality, managing market conduct, preventing financial crime and fraud, product governance and suitability and managing conflicts of interest.\n\nNow in its sixth year of release, the Global Markets Code of Conduct (GMCC), an addition to our CRMF; is the annual re-statement of our continual commitment to promoting good conduct, strengthening our control environment and cultivating a strong ethical firm culture. The first half of 2021 saw the majority of our colleagues continue to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, colleagues are returning to offices in greater numbers. Attention to detail around the control environment during this period is of the utmost importance to managing risk. Markets' distributed architecture has been essential to our ability to operate effectively throughout this year and we have been mindful of the risks that this environment has created. The business has remained vigilant in identifying and mitigating Conduct risks as we navigate these challenging times.\n\nThe GMCC is a good example of how we are operating in line with the Barclays Purpose, Values and Mindset and will help ensure that we are best positioned to drive good outcomes for our stakeholders, including shareholders, colleagues, clients and society.",

Our sales quality standards are designed to ensure we understand our clients' risk profiles, circumstances, investment needs and objectives. Our Training & Competency (T&C) Scheme, Sales and Suitability process and Advice Quality Assessment processes are designed to ensure that our client advisers are qualified and trained in order to perform their regulated roles, alongside being able to provide suitable and appropriate investment advice to our clients.\n\nOur Private Bank senior leaders spend significant time setting the framework designed to ensure our Purpose, Values and Mindset are now deeply embedded in our objectives and plans.\n\nIn addition, we strengthen our culture with clear and effective controls by assessing conduct of in-scope frontline employees against key testing and metrics that are presented in a Conduct risk dashboard, ensuring conduct issues are captured, discussed and reviewed regularly. The Private Bank T&C scheme encompasses the responsibilities of a supervisor and helps to ensure that regulated or relevant employees' skills, knowledge and performance are regularly assessed, their competence is maintained and their skills are regularly developed. We work to ensure that clients are put at the heart of everything we do; monitoring processes are in place to identify when customer detriment may have occurred. In those potential circumstances, we undertake the appropriate activity, including following complaints handling and redress procedures, to help ensure our clients are put back in the position they should have been in should the detriment had not occurred. While things can and sometimes do go wrong, we have a formal root cause programme that allows us to learn from complaints and be proactive with clients on potential issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumer, Cards and Payments\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we introduced a range of forbearance measures across our issuing and acquiring businesses. In Issuing, additional support options implemented in 2020 were carried forward with payment holidays and interest and fee suspensions offered to support businesses experiencing payment difficulties. In Acquiring, businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic could freeze fixed monthly payments for 3 or 6 months as well as waiving minimum billing was waived for all customers during each of the national lockdowns. This was extended in 2021 for some sectors that were unable to re-open immediately after the lockdown such as hospitality.\n\nIn 2021, Barclays Payments has continued to focus on a customer-led approach, simplifying our product offerings, reducing paper consumption, supporting colleagues as we have continued to work from home and transition back into the office. Barclays Payments continues to embed the Group's global diversity and inclusion agenda while continuing to take effective action to support clients through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConsumer Bank Europe (CBE) continues to improve its payment and lending offering and responds to ever changing customer behaviour. While closely monitoring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customer base, CBE has continued to strengthen its 'Buy Now Pay Later' product features. These are giving customers the flexibility of a card in combination with structured repayment capabilities. This innovative financing solution was also embedded in a major e-commerce partnership solution with Amazon, offering customers a seamless experience with a fully digital onboarding and servicing process. With this partnership solution, CBE is now extending this offer to new partnerships.\n\nOur US Consumer Bank (USCB) supported customers and partners, responding to changing customer and client needs as events have continued to unfold in 2021. We have built on the targeted action taken in 2020 to support customers who experienced financial disruption or hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuing to offer Hardship Assistance as well as dedicated Payment Relief Plans for both Cards and Consumer Loan customers up until May 2021.\n\nAs we continue to develop relationships with our clients and customers, we remain focused on automation and digitisation to further enhance the products and services we offer. Digital enhancements to our disaster relief process were made in 2021, initially developed to assist vulnerable customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, were also provided to card members impacted by Hurricane Ida enabling them to enrol online for relief, in addition to also being able to contact live call centre agents for assistance, further improving the customer experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Client Experience Forum examines specific client journey reviews and detailed issue root cause analysis to improve our processes and the client experience. Our ongoing focus is to enhance the client journey for a superior and seamless omni-channel client experience that is platform agnostic, while supporting the drive for scalable growth.\n\nThe services we provide and the manner in which they are delivered continue to evolve, driven by the changing needs of our clients and guided by the regulatory landscape in which we operate. The Private Bank Product and Proposition Committee (PPC) reviews new and amended product / service proposals from an end to end perspective. The PPC provides review, challenge and guidance, which is designed to ensure any changes to our products and/or services are assessed from a client, conduct and risk perspective. The PPC facilitates the progression of proposals through the NAPA process as applicable, ensuring the required governance process is followed prior to product launch. Our product and service families are reviewed on an annual basis to help ensure our products and services continue to meet the needs of our clients and mitigate the risk of foreseeable harm. Product Review outcomes are presented at the Private Bank Product Review Committee, aligned to the requirements of the Group Product Review Standard. We all have a responsibility to look to ensure that our clients are at the heart of every process, activity and decision, and that we have a clear understanding of the consequences of our actions.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase of vulnerability across the population, it is paramount to ensure we understand the needs of vulnerable clients to make sure they are treated fairly building on our existing support for them. A Private Bank vulnerability programme was set up to help ensure applicable regulations and guidelines are adhered to, including the roll out of best practices on controls and processes, as well as, further training designed to ensure all our staff have the right skills and capability to recognise and respond to the needs of our vulnerable clients.",

Leaders are expected to role model behaviours leading an effective 'tone from the top' in addition to driving good culture and conduct outcomes to embed a customer-focused culture throughout our business, which is comprised of Customer, Product, Business Banking, Wealth Management and Investments, Transformation, and our Chief Operating Office.\n\nThe Barclays Way sets out standards and behaviours that we must demonstrate and guides how we conduct our business across Barclays UK. Our CRMF incorporates four key risks: Market Integrity, Customer Protection, Financial Crime and Product Design and Review.\n\nWe review a range of topics to monitor both the risk and cultures set out in our strategic plans and operations, supported by Conduct risk assessments and key indicators. Working within the CRMF, we evaluate, respond and monitor Conduct risk.\n\nWe assess Conduct risk against key conduct controls set out in the CRMF and metrics and proactively look forward to identify new and emerging risks. Outputs are included in quarterly assessments and reported through the Barclays UK Conduct risk dashboards, culminating in an aggregated risk profile, which is reported to the appropriate Barclays UK Board Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BUK businesses are carried on by BBUKPLC and certain other entities within the Group. For information regarding BBUKPLC Board governance and activities, please refer to the BBUKPLC Annual Report 2021 available at home.barclays/annualreport\n\nBarclays UK relies on two critical processes designed to ensure that our products and services meet the needs of our customers through their design. The NAPA process looks to ensure that the needs of our customers are met when new products are launched or existing products are amended, or that customer impacts are considered when products are withdrawn.\n\n## Product design\n\nWherever a product or service is found to be outside Appetite, the product or service owner must look to ensure that actions are taken to address this. The actions are validated by functional areas, including Legal and Compliance.\n\nThe Product Review process encourages greater product oversight by requiring that all existing products and services are reviewed annually, to help ensure that they continue to meet the needs of our customers.\n\nBoth processes include, among other things, consideration of the product or service income generation approach; pricing structure complexity; fees or charges; the use of short-term promotions or offers; and features or add-ons that customers pay for as part of this product.\n\n## This includes requirements that:\n\n- b.   customers are able to exit or downgrade from the product or product elements with minimal difficulty or cost,\n- a.   the product or service meets a clear, unique and genuine customer need,\n- c.   an option to cancel without cost within a 'cooling off ' period is offered as standard, and there is minimal difficulty or cost to cancel or switch after this period has ended, and\n- d.   customer vulnerability is considered and the risk of causing customer detriment, including adverse impacts on customer outcomes, customer harm, distress, inconvenience, reduced choice and loss of opportunity or benefit, is mitigated.\n\n## The product review process also covers matters including:\n\n- b.   benefits versus best interests to customers and clients and the business,\n- a.   product parameters, including target markets, client segments, ongoing suitability and whether the product or service remains consistent with the needs, characteristics and objectives of the identified target market,\n- c.   features of the product or service,\n- e.   financial and non-financial risks as relevant to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or Barclays due to wilful misconduct,\n- d.   distribution services and access channels\n- f. post-sale transactional services where there is potential for customer, client or market detriment, and\n- g.   relevant supporting infrastructure and controls including data, resilience and technology, and any potential issues identified.\n\n## Notes\n\n\u00ae Net Promoter, Net Promoter System, Net Promoter Score, NPS and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Inc., Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems, Inc.\n\n## BUK conduct culture plan\n\nOur focus is now to fully embed and integrate conduct within our wider culture strategy. This will continue to embed as part of Barclays UK's people and culture transformation programme.\n\nThrough 2021, Barclays UK took a number of actions to further improve its culture, which included delivery of improved tools and training on Conduct risk assessments. During 2021, over 23,500 of Barclays UK colleagues completed conduct culture training. This has helped us in identifying, mitigating and monitoring Conduct risks ahead of key decisions and supported increased visibility of Conduct risk assessments by the Barclays Executive Committee.\n\n## Responsible sales practices - reward and incentives\n\nBarclays UK has a well-established Performance Framework in place, that exists to protect the interests of our customers, colleagues and the Company through ensuring the right outcomes. The framework design does not include or permit the use of product sales targets for Customer Facing Teams.\n\nOur Barclays UK reward scheme is designed to incentivise all BUK colleagues to collaborate across the business, to better serve our customers. All colleagues receive an annual incentive payment related to one shared objective: to improve the customer experience. We measure our progress and define payment levels through the use of a brand-level Net Promoter Scores \u00ae . Our customer-facing colleagues receive the majority of their reward as base salary. This provides more financial security for colleagues, while reducing the risk of our reward structure being misaligned with the needs and desires of our customers.\n\n## Product design and review\n\nBarclays UK conforms to the enhanced Barclays Product and Services Lifecycle governance, which is composed of two key processes: Product Approval; and Product Review, which help ensures that our products and services meet the needs of our customers by design and operation.",

The team work to design, sequence and track the plan at an aggregate level, ensuring effective mission control and a proactive culture of overall risk identification and mitigation. As part of this, the team has designed and embedded a series of controls and cultural interventions designed to ensure that conduct is an early and critical consideration of any new project in the plan (a project cannot be gated into delivery without this assessment being in place).  The team also works to track and manage cumulative Conduct risk across the plan which may not be identified at an individual initiative level.\n\nProduct designs and manages the products that Barclays UK personal customers use. This encompasses current accounts, payments, savings, insurance, credit cards, loans, overdrafts and mortgage products.  In common with the rest of Barclays UK, Product's goal is to make money work for our customers. A focus on good conduct, controls and risk management is at the heart of delivering this goal.\n\n## Product\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on driving a Conduct risk mindset through the business, ensuring that conduct is considered at the outset of any new initiative, and as the core consideration in how we manage our products on an ongoing basis. All colleagues have defined performance objectives relating to risk and control and we remain focused on continued colleague education in order to enhance knowledge and reinforce a strong conduct culture. This culture is supported by the robust decision-making processes, and effective risk management and governance that are operated by Barclays UK.\n\nThe results of our focus on  a Conduct risk mindset combined with strong conduct governance is visible in the actions the business has taken to support customers through the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been evidenced in our credit card business model reset, where we have refreshed and simplified our proposition. Product simplification and efficiency remain at the forefront of our customer-centric strategy and our products and propositions are subject to regular review and quality assurance to help ensure they remain fit for purpose and meet our customer needs.\n\n## Business Banking\n\nWe believe it is critical to embed a controls mindset ensuring that robust decision-making processes are in place and enabling us to drive continuous improvements in our control environment. As such, all colleagues have defined performance objectives relating to risk and control and we remain focused on continued colleague education in order to enhance knowledge and reinforce a strong conduct culture.\n\nThe challenges our clients face have been magnified in recent times and as we continue to support them through this post pandemic environment, our social purpose is to support their recovery. We know that good conduct is at the heart of being a partner for growth for our clients. Product simplification and efficiency are at the forefront of our customer-centric strategy and our products and propositions are subject to regular review and quality assurance to help ensure they are fit for purpose and meet our client needs.\n\n## Customer\n\nWe start from the principle that good design must be customer-led. We use a range of sources to understand our customers, in which immersive sessions, where we work together with customers to solve common issues, play a significant role. Other sources of customer insight include quantitative behavioural data, attitudinal data from social media, and feedback on customer experience from our NPS \u00aea research programme. We also apply behavioural science principles to design journeys that feel intuitive to our customers.\n\n## Customer-led design\n\nBefore any concept moves into development, we aim to test and iterate the design with different customer groups. Once ready for launch, we use 'test and learn' approaches and analysis to quantify how our customers react to product changes, and how they assess their value.\n\n## Fair pricing\n\nAt any stage in this process, we can involve our LaunchPad digital community of Barclays customers, to provide us with an ongoing feedback loop. And our 'Colleagues as Customers' Community, Challenger, provides further insight.\n\nWe are committed to treating customers fairly in everything we do, including in how we price our products and services, with a specific focus on vulnerable customers. We have developed a set of fair pricing principles to help ensure that our customers pay a fair price for the products and services they receive, and the principles are designed such that they do not cause foreseeable harm to customers.",

To deliver better outcomes for investors, we merged several of the single-asset class funds in 2021 resulting in an improved line-up of underlying managers and reduced costs to clients through economies of scale. All funds have been judged to have met their investment objectives and the qualitative assessment highlighted those steps we have taken in the recent past that have helped deliver performance, and value for investors.\n\nThroughout the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also supported customers with increased remote engagements by our Wealth Managers, investment content and virtual events while at the same time ensuring the stability of our Smart Investor investments platform during peak trading times.\n\nWe recognised the fiduciary need to vote and engage with the underlying companies within our portfolios and so commenced these activities in 2021 and aim to continue our progress into 2022.\n\nQuality Assurance testing is conducted across all customer facing functions, including sales practices, complaint handling and account servicing and support. Additional testing is conducted on vulnerability to determine whether frontline colleagues are correctly identifying vulnerable customers and then manage correctly. Testing is conducted against those customer processes that have been evaluated as high risk designed to ensure that customers receive appropriate and fair outcomes. Where customers have not received the correct outcomes, feedback is shared directly so that remediation can be provided swiftly.\n\n## COO and Functions\n\nThe impact on the customer from our Operations and Technology strategy is at the forefront of our execution mindset. While it is our clear expectation that improvements in technology and operational capability will go a long way to improving the experience of our customers; we are aware that the design of strategies don't necessarily fit the needs of all. Execution of change across a complex technology estate brings resilience risks, that unless managed could impact our customers and their financial needs. As such, consideration of Conduct risks and appropriate mitigation is made across our strategy against all our customer base and significant care is undertaken to protect the resilience of our service provision as these changes are made.\n\n## Chief Operating Office\n\n## Governance and reporting\n\nThe outputs from Product Reviews are rated according to the Group-wide standard Risks and Issues Classification Matrix; once the Committee has approved the risk assessment, any risks rated High or Exceptional are escalated to the Barclays UK Risk Committee. Product Review actions are managed through the Barclays Risk Acceptance and Issues Management Standard, with all associated issues and actions tracked by the Product Review Committees.\n\nBoth Product Review and NAPA operate with robust governance in place with separate monthly committees that provide Senior Management oversight of the outputs from both processes.",

We have made significant progress, but we know there is more to do.\n\nFollowing publication of the finalised FCA Vulnerability Guidance in February 2021, we took the opportunity to review key areas that underpin our treatment of customers in vulnerable circumstances. Barclays defines vulnerability as any existing or potential customers who, due to their personal circumstances e.g. financial difficulty, long term medical conditions, or other personal circumstances, are especially susceptible to detriment. To better support customers experiencing these circumstances we have begun the delivery of enhancements to our Barclays' tools, training, support and systems which will lay an important foundation for continuing to improve our on-going support when customers need us the most.\n\nWe seek to consider the requirements of all our stakeholders during the development of products and services. This includes the requirement to consider accessibility and inclusion, giving customers the ability to take control of their finances in a manner convenient to them and the promotion of financial capability.\n\nOur unsecured borrowing solutions for consumers allow  customers to borrow money without offering up a security based on a major asset. Customers of this business are  protected by the Consumer Credit Act and the FCA's Consumer Credit Sourcebook, and all the safeguards that these afford, such as rules on point of sale disclosures, affordability assessments, and how we treat customers who are in financial difficulty, or in danger of falling into financial difficulty. This differs from some other forms of borrowing, for instance; unregulated 'buy now, pay later' and 'short term interest free' credit, where some providers operate outside of the regulatory perimeter with different levels of protection afforded to customers.\n\nWe have systems and processes in place to identify the signs of a customer encountering financial difficulty, and where required, we work with our customers with the objective of enabling their return to financial health.\n\nWhile regulation determines how we must treat customers who are already in persistent debt, we aim to go further and we have taken measures aimed at preventing customers from reaching this stage in the first place. To help customers avoid entering persistent debt in the future, we have changed customers' minimum payment structure. Since February 2021, all new credit card accounts are automatically put onto the new higher minimum payment calculation. In addition, a phased approach to increase minimum payments for existing customers started in January 2021 and will continue into 2022.\n\nWe also have information available for customers through our Money Management Hub, providing tangible examples of how banks can support customers who are worried about their finances. The Money Management Hub has also been designed with a broader range of consumers in mind, containing guides on budgeting, saving and planning for the future, as well as advice on handling debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncla\n\nIn line with regulatory requirements including those mentioned above, we strive to support our credit card customers in using their lending facilities in a sustainable way. We communicate with credit card customers deemed to be in persistent debt to support them to repay their balances faster and so reduce their overall interest charges. Customers who are unable to exit persistent debt within the regulatory mandated 36-month period are offered a bespoke Paydown Plan. This includes interest rate concessions to make it affordable for them to repay their balance within four years.",

We have also recently introduced similar controls for our credit card customers.\n\nThe Barclays UK SME Portfolio, which includes the Education, Social Housing, Local Authorities and Income Producing Real Estate portfolio, is governed by policies and standards that are designed to comply with the relevant regulation, mitigate the risk of defaulting for customers experiencing challenging circumstances and provide a framework for impairment, provisioning and forbearance.\n\nTo help customers who have fallen behind on payments and to enable them to self-cure in their channel of choice, we are digitising our Barclays Financial Assistance (BFA) support. We have simple repayment journeys available for use by early cycle arrears customers across all unsecured products, and a short-form Income and Expenditure form for those who need more complex support. Eligible Barclaycard customers also have the opportunity to set up a repayment plan in app. These tools increase accessibility by enabling customers to choose a time that suits them to address their arrears, promoting better customer engagement. Further strategic changes are anticipated to provide additional payment plans for customers with unsecured borrowing products who require BFA support.\n\nIn order to make a credit decision a number of factors are considered including customer profile and management, business environment, financial performance, Barclays mandate and risk appetite for the sector. Regular monitoring is in place to ensure lending policies and procedures remain effective.\n\nBarclays understands that gambling and financial difficulty can often go hand in hand and that customers may sometimes, find it hard to ask for help. We continue to work in partnership with GamCare, a UK charity which provides information, advice and support for anyone affected by problem gambling. GamCare have provided additional training for our specialist financial assistance teams helping them have conversations with customers who are impacted by problem gambling, directly transferring those who need further support to trained GamCare advisers.\n\n## Gambling\n\nIn April 2020, the Gambling Commission announced a ban on gambling businesses allowing consumers to use credit cards to gamble. This ban, which relies on gambling operators refusing credit card payments, we issued a Notice of Variation on 26 January 2021 to all Barclaycard customers which applies a block on gambling transactions at a card level. Any transaction classified as gambling will subsequently not be processed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found at: barclays.co.uk/ gambling-support/\n\n## Domestic abuse\n\n## Economic difficulties\n\nTo support customers impacted by domestic abuse, we have worked closely with Refuge, a UK charity providing specialist support for women and children experiencing domestic abuse. This enables us to direct those impacted by domestic abuse to expert advice and assist survivors with the opening of bank accounts and gaining access to banking services in situations where they may not have the requisite documentation.\n\nMany customers have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as explained in our 2020 Annual Report, data analysis has been conducted across the Barclays UK customer base to identify specific cohorts of customers who were showing signs of potential financial difficulty in order to assess what support may be required. The help offered to customers has ranged from helping with budgeting, providing them with support directly (including the proactive campaign we ran in June 2021, reaching out to over 163,000 customers via a two-way SMS to offer support) or guiding them towards dedicated functions such as BFA or external agencies such as Step Change where appropriate.\n\nBarclays has continued to work with ProxyAddress, a social enterprise service which enables the use of an alias address to be used for the purposes of connecting those facing homelessness with support, independent of location, to provide access to financial services for people facing homelessness.\n\n## Homelessness\n\n## Cancer diagnosis\n\nWe have worked with Macmillan, a UK-based cancer charity, to provide training to specialist teams to help them have discussions with customers who are impacted by a cancer diagnosis and have concerns over their financial position. This also includes referring customers, where appropriate, to Macmillan for further expert support.\n\nWe seek to proactively engage and support Barclays UK SME customers who experience financial difficulty, through Barclays Business Support with the intention of delivering good customer outcomes.\n\nSome of the other ways we seek to promote responsible and inclusive banking and increase accessibility are set out below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Barclays Accessibility statement is available at: barclays.co.uk/accessibility/statement/\n\nPlease refer to the Directors' Report on page 121 for details of how the BPLC Board continued to monitor Barclays' response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group's activities across the globe, making decisions to support customers and clients, during 2021.\n\n## Building financial wellbeing\n\nAs part of our aim to deliver a world-class money management experience and help money work for our customers, we are delivering more tools and features to educate them on managing their money. We are providing knowledge and expertise through our colleagues, whether that be helping customers to use our digital platforms via the Digital Eagles, or supporting customers in their understanding of financial products, to build financial plans, and save money through budgeting via our Barclays Money Mentors \u00ae .

This ensures front line colleagues are better equipped to support customers in vulnerable circumstances.\n\n38,527 Barclays UK colleagues completed the mandatory Customers in Vulnerable Circumstances annual e-learning modules.

In addition to the general prohibition against engaging in bribery and corruption (giving and receiving), the Standards contain the minimum risk-based control requirements (including ABC review and oversight) that all Barclays businesses, legal entities and employees must follow. The Standards address five key risk areas:\n\n- \u25a0 expenditure - e.g. how to deal with facilitation payment requests; gifts & entertainment recording/ review processes; charitable donations; commercial sponsorships and political donations,\n- \u25a0 introducers - e.g. enhanced risk assessment, due diligence, approval, contract clauses, monitoring and review for suppliers who are paid to introduce new customers/business to Barclays, and\n- \u25a0 third parties - e.g. risk assessment, due diligence, contract clauses and review for suppliers of services who are paid to act for and on behalf of Barclays,\n- \u25a0 strategic and principal investments - e.g. risk assessment, due diligence and contract clause requirements for Barclays' proprietary investments.\n\nWe benchmark our ABC control framework by taking part in expert working groups and external surveys. For example, Transparency International's (TI) Corporate Anti-Corruption Benchmark, which measures and compares the performance of corporate ABC programmes in the UK using TI's extensive anticorruption expertise and the input of experienced specialist practitioners. The Barclays ABC control framework currently holds an 'A' rating.\n\nThese Standards also provide information about how to obtain guidance/advice and report incidents and form part of a robust ABC control framework, which has been developed to manage our legal, regulatory and reputational risks. This includes activities relating to: assignment of roles and responsibilities; risk assessment; employee training; employee screening; escalation processes; controls testing; assurance and audit.",

This legislation, together with regulations, rules and industry guidance, form the cornerstone of AML obligations for UK firms and outline the offences and penalties for failing to comply.\n\nMoney laundering (including terrorist financing and the proliferation of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons) have been identified as major threats to the international financial services community and therefore to Barclays.\n\nThe requirements of UK legislation apply to Barclays globally. Group companies may have additional local policies and procedures designed to comply with their local legislation, regulations and any governmentapproved guidance in the jurisdiction(s) in which they operate. The principal requirements, obligations and penalties currently in force, on which the Barclays AML prevention approach is based, are contained in:\n\n- \u25a0 The Terrorism Act 2000, as amended,\n- \u25a0 The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), as amended,\n- \u25a0 The Terrorism Act 2006,\n- \u25a0 The Joint Money Laundering Steering group (JMLSG) guidance for the UK financial sector on the prevention of money laundering/combating terrorist financing.\n- \u25a0 The UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017, as amended, The FCA Handbook of Rules and Guidance (in particular, the 'Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls' (SYSC) Sourcebook, which relates to the management and control of money laundering risk), and\n\nThe Barclays Financial Crime Policy and the four associated AML Standards are designed to ensure that all Barclays businesses and legal entities comply with the requirements and obligations set out in UK legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance for\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation\n\nWe comply with the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 and all applicable tax evasion/tax evasion facilitation laws wherever we do business.\n\nBarclays takes a zero-tolerance approach to deliberate facilitation of tax evasion in any country and has procedures in place to prevent it. We also expect the same from our employees and third parties providing services for or on our behalf.\n\nTax evasion is a financial crime and a predicate offence to money laundering in the UK and in many other countries in which we operate. Barclays is committed to:\n\n- \u25a0 preventing tax evasion facilitation by our employees or third parties acting for or on our behalf.\n- \u25a0 dealing only with customers who have appropriately declared their assets to the relevant tax authorities, and\n\nWe have an Anti-Tax Evasion Facilitation Standard, which addresses the risks associated with employees and third parties who act for or on behalf of Barclays. This includes:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring that we take account of tax evasion/tax evasion facilitation as red flags for suspicious activity,\n- \u25a0 prohibiting employees from facilitating tax evasion,\n- \u25a0 subjecting third party and introducer/intermediary relationships to specific anti-tax evasion facilitation controls, including risk assessment, due diligence, contract clauses, monitoring and review, and\n- \u25a0 information about how to obtain guidance/advice on tax-related matters and report incidents.\n\n## Sanctions\n\nAs a global financial institution, Barclays must comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations in every jurisdiction in which it operates, or which apply to it because of its place of incorporation. In addition, in order to protect its reputation and other legitimate business interests, in certain circumstances, Barclays sanctions risk appetite may be stricter than its legal obligations.\n\nSanctions are restrictions on activity with targeted countries, governments, entities, individuals and industries that are imposed by bodies such as the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN), groups of countries, or individual countries, such as the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nThe Financial Crime Policy and associated Sanctions Standard are designed to ensure that Barclays and its employees know how to identify and manage the risks associated with sanctions, including the risk that activity is undertaken through Barclays in breach of sanctions regulations.\n\nTo achieve this, the Sanctions Standard sets out the mandatory minimum control requirements, which must be complied with by all Barclays businesses and legal entities, including controls relating to: developing procedures; identifying applicable laws and regulations; risk assessments; transaction, customer and employee screening; escalation processes; and records retention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Barclays financial crime statement and more information on Barclays Tax Principles can be found at: home.barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/ statements-and-policy-positions/\n\nthe financial services sector. This includes the requirement to have adequate systems and controls in place to mitigate the risk of the firm being used to facilitate financial crime. As a transatlantic bank the Standards take account EU and US anti-money laundering requirements, as well as  guidance issued by bodies such as the Wolfsberg Group and the European Banking Authority. The Standards focus on four key risk areas: the customer lifecycle; correspondent relationships; politically exposed persons; and wire transfers.\n\n- \u25a0 the appointment of an officer responsible for compliance with the UK Money Laundering Regulations 2017 (as amended), and the appointment of money laundering reporting officers of sufficient seniority, who have responsibility for oversight of business and legal entity compliance with relevant legislation, regulations, rules and industry guidance,\n\nThe Standards set out the minimum control requirements, which must be complied with by all Barclays businesses and legal entities, including:\n\n- \u25a0 establishing and maintaining a risk-based approach towards assessing and managing the money laundering and terrorist financing risks to the Group,\n- -Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs),\n- \u25a0 establishing and maintaining risk-based customer due diligence, identification, verification and know your customer (KYC) procedures, including enhanced due diligence for those customers presenting higher risk, such as:\n- -business relationships and transactions with persons established in countries identified as having strategic anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing deficiencies ('high-risk third countries'), and\n- \u25a0 Barclays will not enter into or maintain a Business Relationship with, or on behalf of, shell banks or entities with bearer shares where these are prohibited under local law.\n- -correspondent banking relationships.",

Colleagues are encouraged to speak up about actions and behaviours that have no place in the organisation. Through our YourView survey in 2021, 79% of global respondents said it was 'safe to speak up'. Individuals are encouraged to raise concerns directly to their management, Compliance, HR or Legal. However, sometimes employees do not feel comfortable using these avenues. To help them, Barclays has a dedicated independent Raising Concerns process, through which colleagues can report their concerns in the knowledge that the reports will be taken seriously, and managed sensitively and confidentially.\n\nWhistleblowing relates to concerns which fall within the wider public interest, such as a breach of our policies and procedures; breaches of law and regulation; and behaviour that harms or is likely to harm the reputation or financial wellbeing of the Group. All whistleblowing reports are taken seriously and no-one should experience any form of overt or covert retaliation of any kind. Any confirmed instances of retaliation will be dealt with extremely seriously.\n\nThe Raising Concerns team will assess the concerns raised and refer them to the most appropriate team for review and, where appropriate, investigation. The Raising Concerns reporting channels are also available externally. Concerns assessed as whistleblowing will be directed to a dedicated team within Compliance. Whistleblowing is a core element of Raising Concerns at Barclays.\n\nIn 2021, the whistleblowing team opened a total of 134 whistleblowing concerns down 58% (2020: 319) including 32 retaliation concerns raised by 14 unique whistleblowers. 319 were opened in 2020 including, 129 COVID-19 concerns. The number of concerns raised anonymously during 2021 has also decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 which may suggest that colleagues are more comfortable raising concerns without fear of retaliation.\n\nThe Chair of the Group Board Audit Committee has been appointed as the Group Whistleblowers' Champion and additionally, the Chair of the Barclays Bank UK PLC (BBUKPLC) Board Audit Committee has been appointed as the BBUKPLC Whistleblowers' Champion. They have responsibility for ensuring and overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of Barclays' whistleblowing programme across their respective entities.\n\n205 whistleblowing matters were closed in 2021, of which 19% were found to have some level of substantiation. None of the retaliation concerns closed in 2021 were substantiated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Please refer to pages 131, 133 and 137 and the BBPLC and BBUKPLC 2021 Annual Reports available at: home.barclays/annualreport for details of the BPLC, BBPLC and BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee oversight in relation to Barclays' whistleblowing policies and procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Whistleblowing cases opened by category\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n134",

A core central privacy compliance team together with privacy leads in our key jurisdictions provide essential support and expertise for businesses across the Barclays Group. A Group Data Protection Officer (DPO) reports on data privacy issues and compliance to the highest level of management, ensuring there is appropriate awareness, accountability and oversight for privacy matters.\n\nPrivacy and data protection laws vary across the jurisdictions in which we operate, but in general reflect a growing appreciation for the importance of privacy and transparency when we hold or process personal data. We operate in accordance with these standards and we recognise sound privacy practice is a key element of good corporate governance and responsibility.\n\nA comprehensive Group-wide Barclays Privacy Standard sets out for Barclays businesses and functions globally how we expect them to collect, handle, store, share, use and dispose of personal information. Colleagues must complete annual privacy training which is reviewed and refreshed each year. Additional tailored training is provided as necessary upon request to meet specific needs.\n\nThrough customer and employee Privacy Notices, we endeavour to explain clearly and openly how and why we use personal information, how it might be shared, and the legal grounds relied on for processing personal data. Customers and the public may raise any concerns with the Group DPO via a public mailbox. Several jurisdictions provide individuals with a right to request access to their personal data. To meet obligations in this respect Barclays provides dedicated secure means to enable individuals to make their requests and receive responses from a dedicated team.\n\nData privacy is an important matter for our customers, employees and management of Barclays. When we receive complaints we seek to address them fairly and completely.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to strengthen our data security policies and controls to protect the Group's sensitive information and the data that has been entrusted to us by customers and clients.\n\n## Data security\n\nIn particular during 2021, we have introduced additional automated controls to discover data that is highly sensitive but not protected in line with our standards. This data is then either protected in line with its sensitivity or removed in line with our data retention requirements, if its continuing availability carries residual risk.\n\nBarclays has also taken significant additional steps in 2021 to assure the security of data we share with third parties, including conducting on-site inspections with some suppliers to review their controls against contractual obligations and industry standards.\n\nAs Barclays accelerates the migration of digital services to the cloud, we apply the same design principles that underpin our existing control environment. We have strong controls and monitoring in place designed to ensure that cloud-hosted data is secure and maintains its integrity.\n\nAs we transition to a more hybrid working model we have augmented the education we provide to colleagues and strengthened the monitoring of how customer and client data is accessed and used to help minimise the risk of exploitation or leakage.\n\n## Chief Security Office\n\nThe Group has an Information and Cyber Security Policy supported by ten Standards which define the minimum requirements for cyber security matters across the entire Barclays Group.\n\nThe Chief Security Officer for the Group heads the Chief Security Office, and they report directly to the Chief Operating Officer who sits on the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Data resilience\n\nThe Barclays Chief Security Office (CSO) has a set of preventative key controls that mitigate cyber-related risks. These focus on understanding internal and external threats and delivering our capability to counteract them. Large-scale data corruption is one cyber threat on which we are focused. Major risk events have been seen in other organisations and Barclays is focused on continuously reviewing and improving our response and recovery plans in preparation for these evolving threats. Our teams use intelligence to create plausible cyber security and data compromise scenarios which we simulate to help us focus on continuous improvement.\n\nWe also maintain third-party controls and obligations to look to ensure any personal data handled by our suppliers is appropriately safeguarded and respected throughout our supply chain.",

Customers and clients have increased expectations for us to be 'Always On' and the interconnectivity of the financial sector means the stability and resilience of our systems, workforce and continued provision of third-party services all have a direct impact on the quality of our service.\n\nTo enable this, we define Group-wide business services and their interdependencies across the Group including technology, third party services and our workforce and develop the recovery plans and business response plans required should a disruption event occur. We review and validate these mechanisms on an ongoing basis, through regular testing with the aim of reducing the volume and impact of operational incidents year-on-year. We also conduct regular assurance on third parties to assess the  their capability.\n\nResilience and security is set as a priority from the BPLC Board and is the responsibility of everyone within the Group.

All colleagues have a reporting tool integrated into their email account, enabling them to report suspected phishing mails for investigation and receive feedback on whether the reported mail was suspect, genuine or part of an educational campaign.\n\nBarclays holds three ISO27001 certifications (being the international standard on how to manage information security) and successfully renewed the Triennial Recertification for Barclays Corporate Banking (Government Banking Service). Barclays also has a UK certification for Digital Banking.\n\nBarclays has adopted a 65-day window for Mandatory Training completion to allow colleagues sufficient time to complete training. The consequence of noncompletion is a breach which can lead to disciplinary action and can impact compensation. The 65-day window covers many different colleague situations including new joiners, returners from sick leave, parental leave and internal movers. Some of these situations are required by law to have a reasonable adjustment time to enable the successful completion of training. This process is managed by Barclays HR and compliance.\n\n## Training\n\n## Reporting phishing\n\nThe Chief Security Office performs a number of key activities related to identifying, investigating, responding to and containing phishing / malicious email incidents. The CSO have embedded an operational process that provides education and awareness content via email to colleagues who clicked a malicious link or attachment in a phishing email with escalating training exercises and management interventions for each repeated instance.\n\n## Certifications",

The PAC is not controlled by Barclays and all decisions regarding contributions are directed by a steering committee, which is comprised of employees eligible to contribute to the PAC.\n\nBarclays is politically neutral and does not engage in party political campaigning or make party political donations as a Group. We engage with governments on issues relevant to our business, our customers and clients, and our employees, and we look to ensure that any communication undertaken is honest, comprehensive and accurate. Barclays does not give any money for political purposes in the UK, the EU or outside of the EU, nor does it make any political donations to political parties or other political organisations, or to any independent election candidates, or incur any political expenditure.\n\nThe Federal Election Commission, in the US, publishes reports on PAC financial data, including individual contributions to the PAC and PAC disbursements throughout the year. Barclays also complies with applicable laws and requirements in relation to government engagement and lobbying, as well as the disclosure and publication of lobbying expenditure in all of the jurisdictions in which they are applicable.

We also believe that Barclays should only engage on issues where we have a legitimate interest (for example, where there is a direct consequence for our business, our customers and clients, or our colleagues).\n\nAs a major economic contributor - whether via the customers and clients we serve, the colleagues we employ, or the tax we pay - we believe it is important to contribute towards relevant public policy debates. To this end, we engage constructively with policymakers in jurisdictions where the firm operates, including with governments, legislatures, trade associations, consumer groups and other organisations like think tanks and NGOs.\n\nWe are committed to being transparent. On our Public Policy Engagement website, we publish material responses to public policy consultations, the agencies we work with in different jurisdictions, as well as key trade association memberships.

In the US, third party advocacy engagement is also publicly reported, as required by the LDA.\n\nAdditionally, Barclays is a member of a number of trade associations globally. These associations work to represent their members, and for many this involves undertaking work to shape industry's collective response to various public policy issues. We seek to be an engaged and productive member of all associations in which the firm participates. The main mechanism for achieving this is through the committees and working group structures that exist within each trade association. To manage our major trade association engagement and meet our accountability and oversight commitments, the Government Relations team monitors who from the firm sits on which working group, and designed to ensure that there is a constant two-way flow of information in and out of those forums.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/reporting-anddisclosures/public-policy-engagement/\n\n## Memberships and signatories\n\n- \u25a0 holds a position on the governance body,\n\nBarclays is a member of a number of associations (such as industry associations) and national or international advocacy organisations in which the organisation:\n\n- \u25a0 participates in projects or committees, and\n- \u25a0 provides substantive funding beyond routine membership dues, and views membership as strategic.\n\n## Sustainability memberships and initiatives\n\n- \u25a0 Ceres\n- \u25a0 Banking Environment Initiative\n- \u25a0 Equator Principles\n- \u25a0 Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA)\n- \u25a0 Financial Services Taskforce (FSTF)\n- \u25a0 Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF)\n- \u25a0 Thun Group\n- \u25a0 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n- \u25a0 United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI)\n- \u25a0 UN Principles of Responsible Investment (UN PRI); Barclays Asset Management Ltd and Barclays UK Retirement Fund are signatories.\n- \u25a0 United Nations Principles of Responsible Banking (PRB)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details can be found at: home. barclays/sustainability/esg-resource-hub/\n\nstatements-and-policy-positions/",

We have ongoing engagement with tax authorities to discuss their inquiries and material issues in relation to our tax affairs, and we respond to feedback from tax authorities,\n- \u25a0 where relevant we seek to reach agreement with tax authorities using mechanisms available to all taxpayers including Advance Pricing Agreements and Mutual Agreement Procedures to clearly establish in which territories our profits should be taxed,\n- \u25a0 we engage with governments, tax authorities and NGOs through public consultations and other discussions to assist with the development of tax policy and the improvement of tax systems, and maintain our transparency with these stakeholders, and\n- \u25a0 we cooperate with tax authorities globally to reduce the scope for individuals and companies to evade tax, and have met all of our 2021 information reporting obligations under the Common Reporting Standard and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act.\n\n- \u25a0 as part of the 'first line of defence' the tax department identifies and manages tax risk by developing appropriate policies, standards and controls to apply across our organisation. Risk and Compliance comprise the 'second line of defence', and Barclays Internal Audit are the 'third line of defence', and these functions review, challenge and provide assurance to the Board in relation to the effectiveness of governance, risk management and controls including those relating to tax risk,\n- \u25a0 our tax department comprises appropriately qualified in-house professionals who are subject to clear standards including that they uphold our Tax Principles and follow our tax code of conduct, which is an integral part of how we operate,\n- \u25a0 we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act control requirements in relation to financial statements disclosures including those related to tax,\n- \u25a0 our governance requires that suitably qualified people are involved in decisions related to tax, tax is fully taken into account when making business decisions and tax risk is identified, assessed and kept under review, and\n- \u25a0 we have no tolerance for tax evasion and have well-established mechanisms for raising concerns about unethical or unlawful behaviour through our 'Whistleblowing' policy, which applies equally to tax matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BPLC Board Audit Committee is responsible for considering the Group's tax strategy and overseeing compliance with the Group's Tax Principles.

The Board is also responsible for the oversight of social and environmental matters, including climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nIn 2020, the Board Risk Committee made the decision that climate risk would become a Principal Risk within the ERMF from 2022. The elevation of climate risk to Principal Risk recognises that it is relevant and material enough to merit establishing a specific bank-wide framework, in line with other Principal Risks.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis forms a key part of Barclays' approach to assessing and quantifying the impact from climate change. We have developed our approach to scenario analysis through detailed quantitative and qualitative risk assessments of particular portfolios and activities.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nWe have developed metrics and targets to track progress against our climate strategy. The adoption of climate-related metrics are helpful for financial sector stakeholders seeking to try to price and manage climate-related risks. In developing our metrics and targets we continue to develop our methodology, including adding granularity and updating external client and industry data as these become available over time. These metrics and targets are used to measure and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities. We summarise progress against our existing set of targets aligned to our climate strategy: operational net zero; portfolio alignment (as shown using our BlueTrack TM methodology); and financing the transition towards a low-carbon economy.\n\n## UK Listing Rules statement of compliance\n\nWe are pleased to confirm that we have included in our TCFD Report climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the four recommendations and the eleven recommended disclosures set out in the June 2017 report entitled Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nThis is our fifth TCFD report. For ease of review, and given the detailed and technical content of the TCFD Report, we have once again published this as a standalone report.\n\nIn October 2021, the TCFD released additional guidance implementing the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (2021 TCFD Annex), which supersedes the 2017 Annex of the same name (2017 TCFD Annex). In line with the current UK Listing Rules requirements, our TCFD-aligned disclosures take\n\ninto account the implementation recommendations in the 2017 TCFD Annex. In addition, we have considered the 2021 TCFD Annex and applied it where possible.\n\nSome recommendations in the 2021 TCFD Annex will require more time for us to fully consider.\n\nWe will be working to implement the rest of the 2021 TCFD Annex recommendations over the course of 2022 and intend to apply these more fully in our next TCFD Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe TCFD Report is available within the Annual Report suite at: home.barclays/annualreport\n\nFurther details on the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures are available at: fsb-tcfd.org",

Barclays' strategy and performance on ESG factors is evaluated by a range of external agencies.\n\nAcross a set of key ESG ratings, our performance improved or remained stable for most ratings year-on-year, with methodology changes the primary drivers of scoring rather than underlying changes in approach or performance.\n\nWe are further engaging with our stakeholders, including ratings agencies, investors and expert bodies, to improve transparency and enhance understanding of different assessment frameworks and ESG scoring models used by the various agencies.\n\nWe continue to enhance disclosures on ESG factors and provide detailed information on our positions and policy statements. As disclosures are a significant driver of ESG ratings performance, we would expect this to continue to support our ratings and benchmarks over time.\n\nThere is currently some inconsistency in terms of what best practice looks like and how it is measured across different ratings agencies. This is reflected in the variance in methodologies, and therefore in the variance in Barclays' ESG rating across the different providers. There is limited consistency in the underlying data used both within and across sectors.\n\nWhile this remains an unregulated area, we believe that it is important that these agencies, working with companies, investors and other market participants, continue to enhance consistency and transparency to support increasingly robust ESG data and ratings in the future.\n\nWe recognise that markets and stakeholders need clear, relevant and consistent information and we will continue to focus on enhancing our disclosures.

However, these data, models and methodologies are not of the same standard as those available in the context of other financial information, nor subject to the same or equivalent disclosure standards, historical reference points, benchmarks or globally accepted accounting principles. There is an inability to rely on historical data as a strong indicator of future trajectories, in the case of climate change and its evolution. Outputs of models, processed data and methodologies will also be affected by underlying data quality which can be hard to assess.\n- \u25a0 made a number of key judgements, estimations and assumptions, and the processes and issues involved are complex. This is for example the case in relation to financed emissions, portfolio alignment, classification of environmental and social financing, operational emissions and measurement of climate risk.\n- \u25a0 appointed KPMG LLP to perform limited independent assurance over selected ESG (including climaterelated disclosures) content marked with \u0394. The assurance engagement was planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 Assurance of Greenhouse Gas Statements.

Together.\n\n## Supporting entrepreneurship\n\nWhen childhood friends Irina Albita and Maria Tanjala decided to pool their expertise in the film and financing sectors, they created a product that is revolutionising the way that creative industries receive payment for their work. Their joint venture, FilmChain, is a fintech that uses blockchain technology to automate the process of channelling royalty payments to rights' holders in film and TV.\n\nFurthermore, with film clients around the globe, Barclays' international network continues to be invaluable to FilmChain as it continues to expand its own client base, with plans to open offices in Germany and the US this year and enter the enterprise market.\n\nBarclays UK has been a crucial partner to FilmChain for four years providing them with the benefits of a globally recognised bank. Our capacity to open unique client bank accounts in any currency and offer competitive FX rates, as well as the customised support of our sector expertise has been crucial to the success of their business. Through the support of the Rise network and their participation in the Female Founders First programme, we have provided support to help them navigate complex business challenges, including fundraising, leadership, scaling and growth. This has been a key differentiator in FilmChain's ability to expand at pace.\n\n' By automating processes and having the ability to open Barclays global client accounts with multi-currency access, FilmChain saves industry professionals millions of pounds in mismanaged funds, human errors and lack of data.\n\nMaria Tanjala Co-Founder, FilmChain\n\nRegistered office: 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP \u00a9 Barclays PLC 2022 Registered in England.

A bespoke corporate governance framework sets out those matters reserved solely to the decision-making power of the Board.\n\nAt Barclays we think of governance as how the Board makes decisions and provides oversight in order to promote Barclays' success for the long-term benefit of our shareholders having regard to the interests of our other priority stakeholder groups - our clients, customers, colleagues and the society in which we operate.\n\nThe Matters Reserved to the Board specifies those decisions to be taken by the Board, including but not limited to material decisions relating to strategy, risk appetite, medium term plans, capital and liquidity plans, risk management and controls frameworks, approval of financial statements, approval of large transactions, approval of share allotments and dividends. The Board has delegated the responsibility for making and implementing operational decisions and running the Group's business on a day-to-day basis to the Group Chief Executive and his senior management team.\n\nIndividual roles on the Board and their responsibilities are set out in our Charter of Expectations . This includes role profiles and the behaviours and competencies required for each role on the Board, namely the Chair, NonExecutive Directors, Executive Directors and Committee Chairs. In accordance with the Charter of Expectations , Non-Executive Directors are responsible for providing effective oversight and scrutiny, strategic guidance and constructive challenge whilst holding the Executive Directors to account against their agreed performance objectives.\n\nThe membership of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards was partially consolidated and streamlined in 2019, leading to significantly improved coordination and efficiency and reducing complexity and unnecessary duplication.\n\nThe Chairs of each of the Board Committees provide a report on the work of the Committee at every Board meeting. In line with best practice, the Board Committees are comprised only of Non-Executive Directors.  You can find out more about the Committees, their membership and their work during 2021 on pages 124 to 147 and 198 to 199.\n\nThe Board is supported in its work by its Committees, each of which has its own Committee terms of reference, which clearly set out its remit and decision-making powers. The principal Committees of the Board and their core responsibilities are set out in the 'Board Governance Framework' on page 118. This structure enables the Board to spend a significant proportion of its time focusing on the strategic direction of the Group.\n\nWe believe that an effective Board is one which\n\ndelivers value for our four priority stakeholder groups - our customers and clients, colleagues, society and investors. We assess the effectiveness of our Board, its Committees and Board members annually. You can read about the 2021 effectiveness review, and progress against the 2020 review and recommendations carried forward, in the report of the Board Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\n## Changes to our Board during  2021\n\nIn 2021, the Board welcomed the addition of two new Directors:\n\n- \u25a0 Julia Wilson, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 April 2021.\n- \u25a0 Venkat, who was appointed as the Group Chief Executive and Executive Director on 1 November 2021\n\nBrian Gilvary succeeded Crawford Gillies in the role of SID with effect from 1 January 2021.\n\nYou can read more about changes to Board composition during 2021, and succession planning for the Board, Board Committees and ExCo, including succession planning for the role of Group Chief Executive which led to Venkat's appointment as Jes Staley's successor and consideration of Non-Executive Director independence, in the report of the Board Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\nJes Staley stepped down as Group Chief Executive and Director of BPLC and BBPLC on 31 October 2021 and, as reported in our 2020 Annual Report, Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down from the Board on 5 May 2021.\n\nMore recently, Robert Berry joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 8 February 2022.\n\nOn 22 February 2022, Tushar Morzaria notified the Board of his intention to retire from the Board and as Group Finance Director, and the Board has agreed that this will take effect on 22 April 2022, with Anna Cross succeeding him as a member of the Board and as Group Finance Director on 23 April 2022.",

This theme ran through a wide range of areas, from the associated economic uncertainties to our future ways of working.\n\nBeyond its consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts, the Board spent time discussing a broad range of financial and non-financial areas over the course of the year including a variety of ESG, and Diversity and Inclusion matters, as well as the Group's return to distributions. Alongside overarching strategy considerations, significant attention was given to consideration in detail of our climate strategy.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Board retained its focus on our strategy, including in the context of our refreshed Purpose and newly launched Barclays Mindset. In November, the Board appointed Venkat to take on the role of Group Chief Executive. Venkat is now driving forwards the implementation of the clear strategy that the Board has established.\n\nYou can read more about some key areas of focus for the Board in 2021 in this section.\n\n## Embedding our Purpose and Mindset and continuing to build a supportive and inclusive culture\n\nFollowing the work completed in 2020 on reinvigorating our Purpose, the Board oversaw the launch of the Group-wide Mindset Empower, Challenge and Drive - in February 2021. Our Mindset defines the way in which we want to get things done at Barclays.\n\nThe Board recognises that business success cannot be separated from the culture of the Group and strongly believes that the Group should have a common Purpose and a single Mindset.\n\nThe Board reviewed the implementation and embedment of the Mindset, challenging management to ensure the global nature of the Group's footprint was taken into account.  The Board discussed how the success of the Mindset would be tracked and measured, including the launch of a new recognition platform which enables the recognition of colleagues displaying the Barclays' Mindset (as well as our shared Values). The Board also reviewed the newly created Mindset Dashboard which highlights early insights and areas of focus, as well as management actions that are being taken to embed and enact the Mindset going forward.\n\nMindset is a core part of the Group's culture and a core focus for the Board.  The Board receives feedback on our culture through a number of channels including:\n\n- \u25a0 direct engagement with colleagues locally to hear their views through channels such as town hall meetings, listening sessions on our flagship talent programmes and office visits. In 2021, this included an inaugural Global Inclusion Summit for over 600 senior leaders including our Group Chief Executive.\n- \u25a0 receiving reports on the outcome of colleague survey results (including measurement of progress against the Mindset), and colleague views on areas such as wellbeing and ways of working\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Board reviewed the multiple workforce engagement mechanisms employed which enable management and the Board to listen to colleagues, monitor organisational culture and take colleague feedback into account in our key decisionmaking processes. It also discussed the key insights that management had gained from those mechanisms and the actions that had been, and are planned to be, taken to address colleague feedback.\n\nOur people and culture section on pages 29 to 34 includes more information on workforce matters, including the Barclays Mindset.",

The Board considered in particular the situation in India where it was clear that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic differed from city to city, in order to ensure that there was an increased focus on colleague engagement and support during this difficult time.\n\nOne of the Board's key focus areas in 2021 was the consideration of our strategy regarding the return to office of our colleagues and how Barclays would move to a future way of working.\n\n## Society\n\nDuring the year, the Board discussed the extension of Barclays' 100x100 Programme to support communities impacted by COVID-19. This forms part of Barclays' \u00a3100m COVID-19 Community Aid Package and has been delivering vital relief to vulnerable communities throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Investors\n\nIn 2021, Barclays held its first 'hybrid' Annual General Meeting (AGM); a combined physical and electronic meeting. The Board shared the frustration and disappointment of our shareholders that, like the 2020 AGM, the 2021 AGM was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic preventing shareholders from attending in person. Recognising the value of the AGM as a means of engaging with our shareholders, the Board decided to hold a hybrid AGM in order to maximise engagement whilst respecting the Government restrictions and guidance in place at the time. The hybrid nature of the meeting meant that shareholders were able to attend remotely by means of electronic facilities and to vote and to raise questions (either via the electronic platform or by telephone) in real time.\n\nThis support included repayment holidays, as well as the UK Government support schemes for businesses, such as the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS).\n\nThe Board was keen to ensure a balanced and flexible approach, which met both the needs of the business whilst also preserving the benefits of flexible working. It reviewed the plans for a phased return to office developed by the ExCo with the wellbeing, and health and safety of colleagues a key consideration. As a result, and as detailed in Our people and culture section on page 33, the opportunity to work in a hybrid pattern has been extended to many colleagues (spending part of their time working from a Barclays site and part of their time working from home).\n\nIn 2021, this included support in the form of donations to organisations providing emergency relief in India.\n\nFor information about our 2021 AGM and our forthcoming 2022 AGM, please see the How we comply section on pages 148 to 155.\n\nGiven Barclays' financial position, the Board also considered it appropriate to approve the payment of a dividend and a share buyback programme at both the FY 2020 Results and the HY 2021 Results. For more details of this return to distributions, please see below.\n\nFor details of shareholder and investor (retail and institutional) engagement throughout the year, please refer to the How we comply section on pages 148 to 155.",

Deep dive topics discussed by the Board covered a broad range of topics, including Payments, Investments and Advice, Transaction Banking, US Consumer Bank, Risk areas including Cyber, Ransomware and Cloud, as well as Conduct risk. In addition, the Board received updates from individual business areas and from key Group functions including Legal, Compliance, Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility, Risk and HR.\n\nThe Board considered strategy matters at each of its Board meetings throughout 2021 continuing to deepen its understanding of the Group's business and the risks and opportunities Barclays and the wider banking industry faces with a prioritised series of 'deep dive' sessions. This enabled the Board to spend a good proportion of its time considering longer-term and strategic issues.\n\nFor more information on our strategy, please refer to the Strategic report on pages 2 to 50 and, in particular, our Section 172 Statement on pages 16 to 19 to read about how the Board has considered the interests of stakeholders in this context.\n\n## Key decisions:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEndorsement of strategy\n\nApproval of the Group's Medium Term Plan (MTP)\n\n## Succession\n\nThe Board approved Venkat's appointment as the new Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 November 2021. Succession planning for the Board, the Board Committees and ExCo is a key focus for the Board and the Nominations Committee. You can read more about Venkat's appointment and the succession planning for the role of Group Chief Executive which led to Venkat's appointment as Jes Staley's successor, and details of the work the Board Nominations Committee has undertaken with respect to succession planning for the Board, Board Committees and ExCo, in the report of the Board Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\n## Key decisions:\n\nAppointment of Venkat as Group Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Delivering on Diversity and Inclusion\n\nThe Board discussed management's review of Barclays' workforce policies and practices which are designed to support Barclays' efforts to attract, develop and retain diverse talent, and embed an inclusive culture. The Board agreed with management that the workforce policies and practices remain consistent with Barclays' Values and support Barclays' long-term sustainable success.\n\nThe Board, together with management, remains focused on building a supportive and inclusive culture and driving measurable progress. One specific area of focus during 2021 was the Group's Race at Work ambitions and progress made against its Race at Work Action Plan. The Board reviewed and discussed the progress that had been made against these ambitions and oversaw the publication of our inaugural Diversity and Inclusion Report, as well as the appointment of the Group Chief Diversity officer and a new Global Head of Race at Work.\n\nIn addition, the Board scrutinised the existing Board Diversity Policy which includes a gender diversity target (33% female) and adopted an updated Policy on 9 February 2021. The updated Policy includes a new ethnic diversity target aligned with the Parker Review (at least one Board member to be a Person of Colour). The Board reconfirmed its commitment to these targets on 9 February 2022. Further detail can be found in the report of our Board Nominations Committee on page 127.\n\nThe Board reviewed Barclays' response to the diversity consultation papers jointly issued by Barclays' regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority (the PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA) and the Bank of England (the BoE), and discussed the practical challenges to the implementation of the proposals.\n\n## Key decisions:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdoption of an updated Board Diversity Policy\n\n## Sustainability and ESG (including Climate)\n\n## During 2021, the Board:\n\nBarclays' climate ambition, set by the Board, is to be a net zero bank by 2050 and Barclays is committed to Paris alignment across all of its financing activities. Within this context, the Board is focused on the delivery of this ambition. Towards the end of 2021, our Group Chief Executive addressed more than 1,500 clients, investors and corporates at Barclays' Investment Bank's flagship ESG conference 'Making the transition' to discuss Barclays' role in the transition.\n\n- \u25a0 monitored and provided oversight of Barclays' climate strategy and policies and discussed in detail its progress and evolution\n- \u25a0 reinforced its strategic climate leadership ambition including Barclays' status as a founding member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance together with other banks across multiple countries\n- \u25a0 considered the proposed scope of the 'Say on Climate' vote that was announced at the 2021 AGM and which will be put to shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Further details of the 'Say on Climate' vote will be set out in the 2022 Notice of AGM\n- \u25a0 reviewed the potential financial, operational, commercial and legal implications of Barclays' climate strategy\n- \u25a0 agreed that the ESG report should form part of the Annual Report commencing with this Annual Report. Read more about ESG on pages 51 to 104\n- \u25a0 considered climate-related data and reporting, and discussed how progress could be monitored\n- \u25a0 reviewed and approved the updated ERMF which included Climate risk as a Principal Risk with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nIn 2021, a new Group Head of Sustainability was appointed to assist the Group Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility in taking forward the Group's ESG agenda.\n\nThe Board also recognises that the Group has a core social duty to execute its business well, efficiently, responsibly, and to a high quality. The Board accordingly received a deep dive presentation on social impact (the S Strategy), considering how the S Strategy linked to Barclays' Values and in particular considered the approach we take for our communities.",

Four climate-specific updates were provided to the Board by the Group Head of PPCR and the Group Head of Sustainability, covering areas such as progress on our climate strategy, policy updates, industry trends, stakeholder engagement and target-setting.\n\nIn line with our commitment to offer shareholders a 'Say on Climate', we will be publishing an update on our climate strategy, targets and methodology in advance of the 2022 AGM.

Given Barclays' strong capital position and strong business performance at the HY 2021 Results, the Board approved a half year dividend for the period ended 30 June 2021 of 2p per share and a share buyback of up to \u00a3500m.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the SCRIP dividend programme, the Board also approved the introduction of a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for those shareholders who wish to elect to use their dividend payments to purchase additional ordinary shares, rather than receive a cash payment.\n\n## Key decisions:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApproval of a full year dividend for the year ended 31 December 2020 of 1p per share and approval of a share buyback of up to \u00a3700m\n\nApproval of a half year dividend for the period ended 30 June 2021 of 2p per share and approval of a share buyback of up to \u00a3500m\n\nApproval of the introduction of a DRIP",

The Committee plays a vital role in ensuring we are able to achieve this, with its focus on effective Board, Board Committee and ExCo composition and robust succession planning for these and other critical senior management roles.\n\nAs reflected in the Committee's allocation of time, succession planning was an area of significant focus during the year, notably in the context of the Board's appointment of Venkat as\n\nour new Group Chief Executive. The Committee and the Board were pleased to have identified strong internal successors for the roles of Group Chief Executive, and Group Finance Director, following ongoing review of the succession planning for these roles during 2020 and 2021. At the time of his appointment, Venkat held the role of Head of Markets and Global Co-Head of the CIB, and had been identified by the Committee and the Board as the 'Ready Now' successor for the role of Group Chief Executive. As noted in the Chairman's letter on pages 4 to 5, the Board is confident that Venkat will be a great leader of Barclays.\n\nThe Chairman (with the support of the Committee) has overseen a significant refresh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the Board since his appointment, with the appointment of five new independent NonExecutive Directors, Dawn Fitzpatrick, Mohamed El-Erian, Brian Gilvary, Julia Wilson and Robert Berry since 2019, as well as reviewing succession planning for key Board roles including the role of Board Risk Committee Chair as outlined further below.

The Committee agreed a series of priorities which will be considered and refreshed as it reviews potential additions to the Board and manages a robust and orderly succession plan. As ever, diversity remains a priority in all our searches.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to strive for simplicity and clear focus in the Board's agendas, papers and presentations, building on the progress made in previous years. The Board continued to operate on the basis of a partial consolidation and streamlining of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards which was implemented in 2019, whereby the membership of the BBPLC Board became a subset of the BPLC Board, with all members of the BPLC Board, except the SID, the Chair of BBUKPLC and one other Non-Executive Director, also serving on the Board of BBPLC. In addition, having the Chairs of some of the Group's main subsidiaries as members of the BPLC Board, has continued to support significantly improved coordination and efficiency, whilst enabling appropriate focus on the matters relevant to each entity.\n\nAs important as the 'who' is the 'how': a key part of the Board's effectiveness is how it operates in practice.\n\nThis year's Board Effectiveness Review specifically reviewed the effectiveness of the Board and Board Committee structure during the year, and the results of the review confirmed that our Board governance structure continues to deliver its intended benefits whilst respecting the spirit of the ring-fencing legislation in relation to decision-making affecting BBUKPLC.\n\nThe Committee is composed solely of Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by our Chairman.

He has over 26 years of experience in financial services, and since joining Barclays in March 2016 has held the roles of Group Chief Risk Officer (from 2016 to 2020) and Global Head of Markets & Co-President of BBPLC (from October 2020 until his appointment as Group Chief Executive).\n\nWith effect from 1 November 2021, Venkat took over as Group Chief Executive, and became an Executive Director of BPLC and BBPLC.\n\nAs part of the Board's oversight over long-term succession planning, the Committee reviewed succession planning for the role of Group Chief Executive in September 2020. This review included discussion regarding potential internal and external candidates, including an external market mapping review, which was refreshed again over the summer of 2021. Reflecting on the market mapping exercise, the Committee noted the likely challenges around the recruitment of an external candidate with the requisite skill set and experience, and also discussed development for Venkat as part of the approach to 'ready' key successors.\n\nIn considering Venkat's appointment, the Committee - and the Board - took into account feedback on his development, and from ongoing discussions with Board members over the previous year which demonstrated broad support for Venkat as a possible internal successor as Group Chief Executive. The Committee and the Board also had regard to Venkat's significant strength as an enterprise leader as part of the Group ExCo, his expanded leadership and commercial experience through his appointment to the Global Head of Markets role, including leading Front Office personnel and engaging directly with clients and key stakeholders of the CIB, as well as his background in Risk.\n\nVenkat's appointment to the role of Global Head of Markets & Co-President of BBPLC in October 2020, which followed the Committee's discussions in 2020, was designed to build on and develop his commercial experience and to provide a potential internal candidate for Group Chief Executive succession. With regard to the latter, the Board put in place development for Venkat for the role of Group Chief Executive, and had been working to this for the 12-month period leading up to Venkat's appointment. This included Venkat attending regular meetings with the Chairman, the Chair of the Board Risk Committee, and through external mentoring.\n\nThe Committee and the Board also took into account the broader contributions Venkat had made to Group-wide areas such as Barclays' ESG agenda (through the development of Green\n\nFinance initiatives and the development of the BlueTrack\u2122 methodology), and to Barclays' diversity agenda. The Committee and the Board had regard to the stability that his appointment as an internal candidate would bring to the Group's key stakeholder groups, in particular shareholders, colleagues, and customers/clients.\n\n## Changes to the Board in 2021: Non-Executive Directors\n\nJes Staley stepped down as Group Chief Executive and as a Director of BPLC and BBPLC with effect from 31 October 2021.\n\nWe welcomed a new Non-Executive Director in 2021, Julia Wilson, who was appointed as a Non-Executive Director and as a member of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 April 2021. Julia's appointment reflects our commitment to strengthening our Board through the addition of highly respected individuals with strong financial services expertise. She brings significant corporate finance, tax and accounting experience to the Board and to the Board Audit Committee, and the details of her skills and experience are set out in her biography on page 115.\n\nAs foreshadowed in our 2020 Annual Report, Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the 2021 AGM on 5 May 2021. We are grateful to Sir Ian for his contribution to Barclays, in particular as Chair of BBUKPLC until 31 December 2020  and the important role he played in establishing the Board of our ring-fenced bank.\n\nThe Board was also pleased to announce that Robert Berry (latterly Co-Deputy Chief Risk Officer of Goldman Sachs prior to his retirement in 2018) joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 8 February 2022, and will become Chair of the Board Risk Committee (subject to regulatory approval) and a member of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 March 2022.\n\nIn light of Crawford Gillies' appointment as Chair of the BBUKPLC Board on 1 January 2021, Brian Gilvary succeeded Crawford in the roles of SID (with effect from 1 January 2021) and Board Remuneration Committee Chair (with effect from 1 March 2021). As at the date of succeeding Crawford as Board Remuneration Committee Chair, Brian had served as a member of the Board Remuneration Committee for a period of 12 months as recommended by the Code.\n\nIn light of the time commitment associated with his appointment as Chair of Barclays Bank Ireland PLC in April 2021, during the year Tim Breedon stepped down as a member of the Board Remuneration and Audit Committees. Tim will also retire as a member and Chair of the Board Risk Committee, and as a member of this Committee, with effect from 28 February 2022. Tim has served as Chair of the Board Risk Committee since 2014 (and as a member since\n\n2012). The Board is grateful to Tim for his valuable contribution to each of  these Committees and the Board is pleased that he will remain part of the Group as Chair of Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and through his ongoing membership of the Board as a Non-Executive Director.\n\n## Board size\n\nIn addition, Dawn Fitzpatrick was appointed as a member of the Board Remuneration Committee with effect from 1 July 2021.\n\nThe appointment of Julia Wilson, effective 1 April 2021, temporarily increased the size of the Board from 12 to 13 before it reduced to 12 following the resignation of Sir Ian Cheshire on 5 May 2021. The size of the Board returned to 13, following the departure of Jes Staley on 31 October 2021, Venkat's appointment on 1 November 2021 and Robert Berry's appointment on 8 February 2022.\n\n## Non-Executive Director recruitment\n\nThe Committee is confident that the size of the Board remains effective taking into account the need to be small enough to operate in an efficient and collaborative manner and the need to be large enough to have an appropriate mix of skills and diversity and to support succession planning and the additional roles and responsibilities of some of our Directors on Board Committees, and on the Boards of BBPLC, BBUKPLC, Barclays US LLC, BX and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\nIn addition to discussions at formal meetings, the Board and the Committee have discussed succession in detail at regular points in 2021, as detailed on page 128. This included consideration of longer-term succession planning (looking ahead to the skills that may be required on the Board in the future) and medium-term succession planning to ensure the orderly refreshing of the Board and its Committees.\n\nAs a result of our long-term and medium-term succession planning in 2021, as noted on page 128, we have reviewed our search criteria to complement the current range of skills on the Board with additional Non-Executive Directors. The Committee approved a series of skillsbased priorities for potential candidates which is now underpinning our searches going into 2022, with the aim of finding candidates with sufficient board experience and the relevant skills to make a meaningful contribution to Board deliberations, and enhance the Board's ability to provide informed and constructive challenge to management in the development of the Group's strategy, and therefore its effectiveness. As noted above, these priorities are reflective of the skills and experience anticipated to be required for the Board over the next four years, taking account of the needs of the Board, its Committees and the business, as well as ordinary course retirements of a number of long-serving Directors.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Capturing the clear benefits of diversity of background and opinion is at the forefront of that search. Spencer Stuart and Egon Zehnder do not have any connection to Barclays or any of the Directors other than to assist with searches for executive and non-executive talent.\n\nThe search for potential candidates with technology experience has remained challenging. Going into 2022, the Committee has discussed broadening the search base, including in regard to the particular nature of the technology experience that might be desirable.\n\nThe Committee has set rigorous criteria for the roles it is seeking to fill based on the strategic priorities identified in 2021, both in terms of experience and personal qualities. The Committee continues to review the search remit and give further consideration to the desired skills and experience, in order to ensure due consideration is given to strong potential candidates that would further enhance the effectiveness of the Board. Open advertising for Board positions was not used this year.\n\nAs referenced above, Robert Berry joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 8 February 2022, and will become Chair of the Board Risk Committee (subject to regulatory approval) and a member of the Board Audit Committee with effect from 1 March 2022.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Non-Executive Director selection and appointment process in 2021, which was refreshed in 2019, and concluded that no material changes were required to the current process.  It was agreed that, where possible, all Board members should have the opportunity to meet potential candidates, and also that searches for potential candidates should be coordinated across the Group's significant subsidiaries where appropriate.\n\nRobert will bring to the Board robust risk management expertise and a proven track record of risk management for a global financial institution, as he takes on the important role of Chair of the Board Risk Committee. He will also bring an international perspective having worked and lived in the United States for much of his life. The Committee and the Board are confident that he will be a positive addition to the balance, skills and experience of the Board and the Board Risk and Audit Committees.\n\n## Diversity\n\nFurther to the Committee's recommendation, the Board adopted a revised version of the Board Diversity Policy on 9 February 2021, re-affirming the existing gender diversity target (33% female) and adopting a new ethnic diversity target aligned with the Parker Review on the ethnic diversity of UK Boards (at least one Board member to be a Person of Colour). The Board Diversity Policy confirms that the Committee will consider candidates on merit against objective criteria with due regard to the benefits of diversity when identifying suitable candidates for appointment to the Board. The Board reconfirmed its commitment to these targets on 9 February 2022. You can read more about the Board's consideration of diversity and inclusion related matters on page 122.\n\nBoth the Committee and the Board recognise and embrace the benefits of diversity - of gender, ethnicity, cognitive and personal strengths and social backgrounds - at Board, ExCo and senior management level, and consider this an essential element of maintaining a competitive advantage and effective governance, as well as mitigating the risk of 'group think'.\n\nFollowing changes in Board composition in 2020, the Board's gender diversity was 25% female as at 31 December 2020. With the appointment of Julia Wilson to the Board, and Sir Ian Cheshire stepping down, as at 31 December 2021 Board gender diversity was 33% female, in line with both the Board Diversity Policy and the Hampton Alexander Review target.\n\nWhilst the appointment of Robert Berry as a Non-Executive Director (effective 8 February 2022) took us to 31% (as at the date of this report), just below the Board's gender diversity target of 33% female, the Committee remains committed to continuing to bring the very best, diverse talent we can attract to the Board.\n\nEnsuring diversity at Board Committee level remains a priority for the Board and the Committee. As at 31 December 2021,  the gender diversity of each of the Board Committees was as follows: Board Audit Committee - 67% female; Board Remuneration Committee - 67% female; Board Risk Committee - 33% female;  and Board Nominations Committee - 17% female.\n\nGroup-wide, Barclays remains committed to improving the diversity of its leaders and has set a number of targets focused on creating more gender diversity in its wider workforce, including its ambition to achieve 28% female Managing Directors and Directors by the end of 2021. You can read more about gender diversity at Barclays, including data on the percentage of females at Managing Director and Director level,\n\non Group ExCo and within ExCo direct reports and in Barclays' wider workforce in Our people and culture section on pages 29 to 34.\n\nThe Parker Review and Board Diversity Policy ethnicity targets continue to be met following the appointment of Robert Berry on 8 February 2022 (and as at the date of this report), although the percentage of Directors from an ethnically diverse background has reduced from 25% to 23%.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, 25% of the Board was from an ethnically diverse background, meeting the recommendations contained within the Parker Review Committee Report into the Ethnic Diversity of UK Boards and the ethnic diversity target in the Board Diversity Policy.\n\nAlongside the Board, the Committee continues to champion the Group's Race at Work Action Plan, designed to increase the number of under-represented minority employees in our wider workforce; providing more Black and ethnically diverse colleagues with access to career and development opportunities; creating a culture of allyship; and being transparent and measuring our outcomes. Venkat, our Group Chief Executive, has made a significant contribution to Barclays' diversity agenda, and is the executive sponsor for Embrace, the global multicultural network at Barclays. As described on page 122, the Board received regular updates during the year on the Group's Race at Work ambitions and progress against its Race at Work Action Plan.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Independence\n\nYou can find more information on diversity and inclusion, including Barclays' Race at Work Action Plan and targets to increase the number of under-represented minority employees in the UK and US within our wider workforce by the end of 2025, in Our people and culture section on pages 29 to 34. You can also read more in our Diversity and Inclusion Report, which will be made available on our website.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the independence of the Non-Executive Directors and, in the cases of Mike Ashley, Crawford Gillies and Diane Schueneman, all of whom have served on the Board for more than six years, and Tim Breedon who has served on the Board for more than nine years, their independence was subjected to a more rigorous review.  The Committee remains satisfied that the lengths of their tenure have no impact on their respective levels of independence or the effectiveness of their contributions. The Committee and the Board consider all of the Non-Executive Directors to be independent.",

In addition to formal meetings, as noted in further detail above, the Committee has discussed succession at regular points throughout 2021, including with the Board.\n\n## Succession\n\nEffective succession planning should take into account contingency planning (for any unforeseen departures or unexpected absences), medium-term planning (orderly refreshing of the Board, Committees and the ExCo) and long-term planning (looking ahead to the skills that may be required on the Board and the ExCo in the future).\n\nOn 1 November 2021, Tim Breedon had served on the Board for nine years. The Board considers that Tim's breadth of financial services sector experience and deep knowledge of risk and regulatory issues continues to bring significant value to Board discussions, and that his continued tenure as a Non-Executive Director will support a smooth transition of the role of Board Risk Committee Chair in March 2022 (as described on pages 126 to 127).\n\nThe succession planning for the role of Group Chief Executive is described in further detail on page 126 above.\n\nThe Board also considers it advantageous to Group-wide decision-making and appropriate in the near term for the Chairs of the Group's significant subsidiaries to sit on the BPLC Board, considering that it brings important insight to Board discussions, and connectivity with our significant subsidiaries. Accordingly, given Tim's role as Chair of Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, the Group's principal European subsidiary, the Board believes it is appropriate for Tim to continue as an independent Non-Executive Director on the Board. This is consistent with the approach in respect of Crawford Gillies (who is also the Chair of BBUKPLC) and Diane Schueneman (who is also the Chair of BX).\n\nTim remains strongly independent and continues to provide effective challenge, advice and support to management on business performance and decision-making. Having undertaken a rigorous review of Tim's performance as a Non-Executive Director and taking into account other relevant factors that might be considered likely to impair, or could\n\nappear to impair, independence including as set out in Provision 10 of the Code, the Board considers Tim to be independent.\n\nFollowing Venkat's appointment as Group Chief Executive, a number of changes were made to the roles of the existing members of our ExCo with effect from 9 November 2021, to ensure that it continues to have the right balance of skills and experience that we need to deliver for our stakeholders and continue to accelerate our performance. The Committee reviews and discusses all ExCo changes prior to announcement, taking into account executive succession plans, and considers all the changes to ExCo composition during the year. You can read more about the changes made to the roles of the existing members of the ExCo on page 116.\n\nTim stepped down as a member of the Audit and Remuneration Committees on 31 October 2021 as noted above.\n\n## Director training and development\n\nOpportunities for in-person Director training remained limited in 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidance. However, Directors continued to deepen their understanding of the business through Board deep dives, briefings for Board members on key risk topics, and Group function reviews, as described in more detail on page 122. Deep dive topics covered in 2021 covered many areas of the business including Payments, Investments and Advice, Transaction Banking, US Consumer Bank, and Risk areas including Cyber, Ransomware and Cloud, as well as Conduct risk.\n\nIn accordance with its Terms of Reference available at home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/board-committees, the Committee supports the Chairman in developing and monitoring effective induction, training and development for the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Board received updates from selected individual business areas and from key Group functions including Legal, Compliance, Risk and HR. The Board also continued to receive regular updates on Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility matters, as described on page 123, on Reputation Risk matters (for which the Board has direct oversight), as well as a broad range of topics including Barclays' government, industry and regulatory advocacy in addition to ESG matters including climate change. Board members were also invited to attend an Operational Resilience 'teach-in' session at the Board Risk Committee's October 2021 meeting, which focused on the Group's approach to resilience and evolving regulatory expectations in this area.\n\nThe Board also received an annual briefing on regulatory responsibilities, including the Senior Managers Regime and on Barclays' conduct and financial crime policies and standards.\n\nA comprehensive Non-Executive Director induction was completed for Julia Wilson, with sessions covering Board engagement and introductions, strategy, culture, finance, specific business areas, risk, sustainability and ESG, compliance, internal audit, governance matters and additional meetings with the business. A Non-Executive Director induction is currently in progress for Robert Berry, following his appointment to the Board on 8 February 2022.\n\nFollowing his appointment as Group Chief Executive and Executive Director of BPLC and BBPLC, Venkat received a tailored Executive Director induction to the Board which included sessions covering Board governance key matters such as Directors' duties, Senior Managers Regime and Conduct rules, indemnity and insurance cover for Directors, conflicts of interest, disclosure requirements pursuant to the Market Abuse Regime and the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs), the Group Securities Dealing Code, US Corporate Compliance and the Code. Venkat has also had regular one-to-one meetings with the Chairman throughout his induction period, which also included attending one-to-one meetings with each of the Non-Executive Directors, and the Chairs of the Group's main subsidiary Boards (including the Chair of Barclays US LLC).\n\nBrian Gilvary received a briefing on his responsibilities as the Board Remuneration Committee Chair from the Group Reward and Performance director, and a briefing from Crawford Gillies (as outgoing Board Remuneration Committee Chair) by way of a formal handover meeting in accordance with the requirements of the Senior Managers Regime. He also received a briefing on his responsibilities under the Code as SID.\n\nBoard members who joined the boards of the Group's main subsidiary companies during 2021, including Crawford Gillies as Chair of BBUKPLC and Tim Breedon as Chair of Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, have also received comprehensive inductions in respect of these businesses which has further broadened their knowledge and understanding of the Group and brought helpful insight to the Board.\n\nIn addition, Dawn Fitzpatrick received an induction in relation to her appointment as a new member of the Board Remuneration Committee. The induction covered Barclays' remuneration philosophy and Fair Pay Agenda, governance, the regulatory environment, the Directors' Remuneration Policy, Barclays' incentive pools, risk adjustments and wider context relating to Fair Pay, Pay Gaps and Wider Workforce issues.\n\ncla\n\ny",

        "page_content": "In 2022, we plan to reprise the bi-annual briefing sessions delivered to the Board prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These sessions were intended to deepen and broaden the Board's understanding of some of the more complex and technical areas of the business, typically covering three or four topics per session. Subject to any changes in social distancing guidance, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in person in the US and the UK, with Non-Executive Directors from our significant subsidiaries in attendance, and would be combined with a site visit which would also provide the Board with an opportunity for direct workforce engagement.\n\n## Progress against 2020 Board Effectiveness Review, including recommendations carried forward\n\n## Review of Board, Committee and individual Director effectiveness\n\nAs reported in our last Annual Report, we carried forward certain recommendations which had been partially addressed in light of disruption due to the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. These included the following recommendations:\n\n- \u25a0 increase input to the Board from outside Barclays on a wider range of issues\n- \u25a0 schedule fewer deep dives and allocate more time to each of them in 2021, to allow for increased discussion and debate, and facilitate deeper discussion of complex issues without significantly increasing demands on the Board's time\n- \u25a0 consider providing Board members with more opportunities to visit parts of the business in person (once COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions are lifted), to gain a broader understanding of the business and to help facilitate direct workforce engagement\n\nWhilst we made good progress against some of these recommendations, the ongoing restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the continued lack of opportunity for in-person engagement and informal interaction, made matters such as scheduling business site visits to facilitate greater business and colleague engagement challenging.\n\n- \u25a0 add greater technology expertise to the Board, through greater external input or by looking to expand or adjust Board membership.\n\nWhile good efforts have been made to provide opportunities for online engagement and our Chairman was able to travel to the US when the opportunity allowed, we hope that we will be able to enable more of these things in the year ahead.\n\nThe Board deep dives schedule provided the basis for a dynamic programme of strategic business reviews during 2021, and was updated throughout the year to take account of feedback from Board members and the Group's strategic priorities, as well as key developments. During the course of the year, the Chairman continued to invest a significant amount of time with management developing the key questions for the Board's consideration in the deep dive papers, and re-instituted an annual corporate strategy discussion which provides an important framework against which to set the deep dives, consolidates areas of strategic follow up, and which also provides opportunity for a more wide-ranging discussion regarding the challenges and opportunities for the business. Going into 2022, and with the Board now having considered the main business areas and strategic issues through the deep dives schedule, the Board has determined that it is now appropriate to revert to a more typical agenda cadence and approach to the consideration of strategy. Feedback from our 2021 Board Effectiveness Review also highlighted that there was merit in now refreshing these sessions.\n\nAs noted in further detail above, we are continuing to search for a suitable candidate with technology expertise, who also can contribute to the overall effectiveness and diversity of the Board.\n\n## 2021 Board, Board Committee and Individual Director Effectiveness Reviews: Process\n\nFurther to a selection process facilitated by the Committee to identify a suitable external facilitator, which involved consideration of a number of potential facilitators, CSA, an independent, external corporate governance advisory firm was chosen to facilitate the 2021 review.\n\nThe 2021 evaluation of the performance of the BPLC Board, Board Committees and individual Directors was externally facilitated, as required by the Code.\n\nCSA was chosen on the basis that it offered not only the relevant skills but also some prior knowledge of the Group in the context of past advisory roles of CSA and its Managing Director (as disclosed below), and thus the ability to provide more insightful feedback. CSA has no connection to the Group or any individual Director, save as disclosed below.\n\nIn 2017 to 2018 and February 2020, CSA was engaged by Barclays in an advisory capacity (alongside external legal counsel, Slaughter and May) in relation to certain legal and regulatory matters. From July 2019 to June 2021, CSA's Managing Director, Christopher Saul, provided mentoring support to a current member of the ExCo. Whilst acting in his capacity as a partner at Slaughter and May (from which he retired in April 2016), Christopher Saul gave legal advice to Barclays in relation to certain corporate law related matters. CSA and Christopher Saul have no current advisory or mentoring engagements relating to Barclays, its Board or ExCo.\n\nThe Boards of each of BBPLC, BBUKPLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC also elected to appoint CSA to undertake an independent, external evaluation of their effectiveness, and CSA's review of the effectiveness of BBPLC's Board, Board Committees and individual Directors was conducted in parallel with the BPLC review given the partially consolidated structure of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards.\n\nThe Committee considered CSA's independence prior to the firm's appointment and was confident that, notwithstanding that CSA and Christopher Saul had previously advised Barclays as outlined above, CSA would not be constrained in its ability to express an independent view as the external facilitator of the 2021 Board, Board Committee and individual Director effectiveness evaluation.\n\nAs part of the BPLC and BBPLC review, CSA conducted a structured one-on-one interview process with each member of the Board, all members of ExCo, certain members of the BBPLC ExCo, and the lead audit engagement partner of the Group's auditor, KPMG, to obtain feedback on the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and individual directors throughout 2021. CSA also observed certain meetings of the Board and the Board Committees during September, October, November and December 2021. CSA issued its final reports on the findings of the effectiveness review to the Boards of BPLC and BBPLC in December 2021.\n\nFeedback from the review indicated that the Board is operating effectively and that the Board is collegiate, positive, professional and supportive, yet challenging, and benefits from a strong mix of skills and experience with contributions by all Directors during meetings despite restrictions on physical attendance as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Meetings were considered to be well and inclusively chaired, including in hybrid format.\n\nCSA's feedback provides an important input into the further development of the performance and effectiveness of the Board, in particular in identifying areas in which the Board could be more effective.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: Board Nominations Committee report continued\n\nIt was noted that the Board takes timely and well-informed decisions, and has a good understanding of the Group's business. Constructive challenge of management by Non-Executive Directors was observed, noting significant positive development in the Board's relationship with management which was observed as being constructive and respectful.\n\nBoard succession planning was observed as being very much front of mind for the NonExecutive Directors, and the transition following Venkat's appointment as Group Chief Executive was seen to be progressing well.\n\nThe size of the Board was considered to be effective, with a variety of skills and backgrounds. This enabled meaningful and stimulating diversity of thought and contribution, whilst acknowledging the potential benefits of appointing an additional Non-Executive Director with an understanding of digitally-led consumerfacing businesses. This would be given further consideration in the context of the current search for an additional Non-Executive Director with technology expertise. The Chairman's inclusive and thoughtful style, and progress made in refreshing the Board, were recognised.\n\nFeedback from the review confirms that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and BBPLC Boards remain effective and work well in practice, with Board Committees operating effectively and being duly integrated into overall Board processes. In addition, the roles of Crawford Gillies, Diane Schueneman and Tim Breedon as the Chairs of BBUKPLC, BX and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC were felt to facilitate the sharing of additional perspectives relating to these significant subsidiaries.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the Board Effectiveness Review report recommendations from CSA and will be giving further consideration to the implementation of the following matters during 2022:\n\n## 2021 Board Effectiveness Review: Recommendations\n\n- \u25a0 whilst feedback indicated that Board deep dive sessions were generally appreciated by members, consideration should be given to how the approach to these sessions might be refreshed\n- \u25a0 since it had been necessary for the Board to devote a significant part of its agenda to immediate challenges and business strategy over the last two years through the COVID-19 pandemic, consideration should be given to how future Board agendas might be moved more towards important aspects of corporate strategy, including enhanced focus on capital allocation and issues presented by the external environment over the next three to five years\n\n- \u25a0 further consideration should be given to increasing input to the Board from thought leaders, customers and others to provide relevant outside perspectives\n\nThe Board has already taken action to address some of these recommendations, including - as outlined above - reverting to a more typical agenda cadence and approach to the consideration of strategy.  The other items will be subject to further consideration and discussion through the course of this year.\n\n- \u25a0 the process of making Board papers shorter and more focused should be continued.\n\n## Review of Nominations Committee effectiveness\n\nFeedback from the review indicated that the Committee is operating effectively, with a good level of debate and clear decision-making. The Committee is considered well chaired, with a good level of engagement by other Committee members and constructive challenge of management observed. Succession planning for the Board and ExCo was recognised as having been at the core of the Committee's role during the year, noting that the Committee also considered matters relating to Board succession for its key subsidiaries such as BBUKPLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\nThe 2021 Committee effectiveness review was externally facilitated, as required by the Code. The Board appointed CSA to facilitate the review. As part of its review, CSA conducted one-on-one interviews with each member of the Committee, the Group Human Resources Director and Group Company Secretary, and observed the December 2021 Committee meeting. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, enabling the Board to build on areas of strength, and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nThe review recommended that there may be benefit in a further reflection upon Committee membership and the desired composition and scope of activities of the Committee, given that other Non-Executive Directors attended a number of Committee meetings in 2021 in light of there having been some important matters to be considered regarding succession planning and the desire to hear from all Non-Executive Directors on these matters. While routine matters were covered in line with the Committee's terms of reference, it was noted that the Committee may benefit from a more formalised meeting schedule and training sessions for members, as suggested in previous evaluations.  It was acknowledged, however, that a more formalised meeting schedule might not always be possible in the context of the nature of the Committee's roles and responsibilities and that opportunities for in-person training had remained limited in 2021 as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Further consideration will be given to these points during the year.\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of the other Committees\n\nFollowing consideration of the findings of the 2021 Board and Board Committee effectiveness reviews facilitated by CSA, the Committee remains satisfied that the Board and each of the Board Committees are operating effectively.\n\nIn addition to facilitating the review of this Committee's effectiveness, CSA facilitated the effectiveness reviews of the Board Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees, which were also conducted by way of one-on-one interviews with Committee members and relevant senior management, in the same manner as the review of the Board Nominations Committee. As part of its reviews, CSA also observed meetings of the Board Audit, Remuneration and Risk Committees. You can read about those reviews in the individual Committee reports elsewhere in this Governance report.\n\n## Individual Director effectiveness\n\nBased on the feedback obtained through the individual effectiveness reviews facilitated by CSA, the Board supported the view of the Nominations Committee that each Director to be proposed for election or re-election at the 2022 AGM continues to be effective and contributes to Barclays' long-term sustainable success.\n\nAll Directors in office at the end of 2021 were subject to an individual effectiveness review as part of the external review facilitated by the Group Chairman with input and feedback from CSA. CSA considered each Director's individual contribution to the Board as well as any feedback received as part of the broader Board and Committee effectiveness review.\n\nIn accordance with the Code, all of the current Directors of the Company who will be continuing in office, and Anna Cross in her capacity as a Director from 23 April 2022, intend to submit themselves for election or re-election at the 2022 AGM to be held on 4 May 2022 and will be unanimously recommended by the Board for election or re-election as appropriate.\n\nTushar Morzaria has informed the Board of his intention to retire as Group Finance Director and from the Board and the Committee recommended to the Board the appointment of a strong internal candidate, Anna Cross, as his successor. Anna was identified over a year ago as the Board's preferred successor, following a review of potential internal and external candidates.\n\n## Group Finance Director succession",

The path to recovery, however, is still uncertain as the impact of the withdrawal of the various government and central bank support measures as well as new inflationary pressures is not yet fully reflected in the macroeconomic consensus. As in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the level of judgement that management has been required to exercise over the course of 2021 and to date. The Committee has considered in detail how management has applied COVID-19 specific adjustments to its expected credit losses (ECL) charge to ensure the full potential impacts of credit stress are provided for. These adjustments address the temporary nature of government support, the uncertain timing of an economic stress and reflect where economic consensus used in the ECL calculation may not yet have captured the range of economic uncertainty, particularly in the UK.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic extended into 2021, the Committee continued to pay close attention to the reporting of the Group's financial performance as well as monitoring closely the impact on the internal control environment.\n\nThe Committee continued to oversee the ongoing evolution and enhancement of the internal control environment, noting that most of the Group's operations have now achieved a Satisfactory rating. The Committee also closely monitored the control issues, including in respect of a number of ongoing remediation programmes (particularly in the trading areas) and responses to regulatory findings in both the\n\nUK and US. Given the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2021, the Committee has considered at length the impact of this both on our colleagues working arrangements and on our operational environment. It has overseen management's development and roll out of new 'hybrid' working arrangements for the Group with a focus on the control environment elements.\n\nAs in previous years, I held frequent meetings with the Chair of the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee and I also had discussions with the Chairs of the Board Audit Committees of Barclays US LLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC during 2021. I have also recently attended a meeting of the Barclays Bank Ireland PLC Board Audit Committee, and I will be attending meetings of the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee and the Barclays US LLC Board Audit Committee later in 2022. I also continued to meet frequently with members of senior management, including in particular the Group Finance Director and Group Chief Internal Auditor.\n\nBarclays Internal Audit (BIA) is a key component in supporting the Committee's work. I am pleased with the way that the function has performed throughout the year, with respect to scoping, performing and reporting the outcomes of its work both to management and the Committee. I held regular meetings with the Group Chief Internal Auditor and members of her senior management team to ensure that I was aware of current work programmes and any emerging issues. I also agreed the Group Chief Internal Auditor's objectives and the outcomes of her performance assessment and remuneration. I was delighted to have the opportunity to meet some of the BIA team in person whilst in New York towards the end of 2021.\n\nBarclays' climate strategy has been a key area of focus for the Group during 2021 and you can read more about it on pages 2 to 50 of the Strategic report. The impact of climate change on the Group's financial statements continues to be limited at this time, but this is an area that the Committee will continue to monitor.\n\nI have continued my regular engagement with the Group's regulators, both in the UK and US. This has encompassed not only my work as the Chair of the Committee, but also my role as the Group's Whistleblowing Champion. In that respect, I oversaw the production of the third and final annual report which we had agreed to submit to the FCA and PRA in the UK and to the New York Department of Financial Services regarding our whistleblowing programme.\n\nAs part of its determination of whether any control issues required specific disclosure in this Annual Report, the Committee continued to apply similar concepts to those used for assessing internal financial controls for the purposes of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOx). The Committee reached the conclusion that there are no control issues that are considered to be a material weakness and which merit specific disclosure.",

As part of the review, CSA conducted one-on-one interviews with each member of the Committee, the Group Finance Director, Group Chief Operating Officer, Group Chief Compliance Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer and Group Chief Internal Auditor. CSA also observed the September and October 2021 Committee meetings.\n\nThe 2021 Committee effectiveness review was externally facilitated, as required by the Code. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nFeedback from the review confirms that the Committee is operating effectively, with constructive engagement with management observed in meetings and appropriate challenge. The appointment of Julia Wilson as an additional member of the Committee in April 2021 was noted as a very positive addition to the balance of skills and experience of the Committee, particularly in light of her significant corporate finance, tax and accounting expertise.\n\nThe review also confirms that concurrent meetings of the BPLC and the BBPLC Board Audit Committees continue to be effective, with reporting of Committee proceedings at Board meetings pitched at an appropriate level of detail. A good level of interaction with the BBUKPLC Board Audit Committee was also reported.\n\nIt was noted that the Board's strategic priorities for Non-Executive Director recruitment included those with recent and relevant financial experience, which would be of benefit to the Committee.\n\n## Changes to Committee composition\n\nThe review recommended that consideration be given to how the Committee's future agendas might be shaped more towards 'bigger picture' issues, whilst acknowledging the Committee's broad remit, the complexity of Barclays and the expectations of the Group's regulators. A continued focus on the split of work between the Board and the Committee, and potential overlap between the work of the Committee and the subsidiary Board Audit Committees, was considered to be beneficial.\n\nAs noted above, Julia Wilson joined the Committee at the time of her appointment as a Director of BPLC in April 2021. The Committee has benefited from her expertise and her previous audit committee experience at Legal & General Group PLC. On 31 October 2021, Tim Breedon stepped down from the Committee. I would like to extend both my personal thanks and the Committee's gratitude to Tim for his valuable insights and contribution to the work of the Committee during his tenure. I also look forward to welcoming Robert Berry as a new member of the Committee on 1 March 2022, further to his recent appointment to the Board.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWith respect to internal audit, the Committee has recently commissioned Ernst and Young to perform the independent External Quality Assessment (EQA) review of BIA which is required every five years.\n\nIn 2022 it is anticipated that the Committee's main focus in respect of financial reporting will continue to be on the ECL charge. I noted last year the intention of management to simplify the models used for ECL forecasting which should make them more readily responsive to major changes in the economic environment as well as providing greater flexibility to run different scenarios to support sensitivity analysis. This development is underway, but given the ongoing disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is inevitably taking longer than might have been hoped. Nonetheless the first new models are projected to be deployed during 2022 and the Committee will be monitoring this closely. Also in 2022, the Committee will increase its review of the Group's regulatory reporting processes which is an area of increasing regulatory focus both in the UK and US, not just for Barclays but for the industry as a whole. To support this, the Committee will continue to receive regular reports from the Regulatory Management Oversight Committee on the more significant and judgemental interpretations applied in the Group's regulatory reporting.\n\nAs regards internal controls, the Committee will look to assure itself that management continues to make progress on the various remediation programmes and is also positioned to meet the various commitments given to regulators on issues they have raised. It is also likely that there will be continuing developments in relation to new ways of working, the control implications of which the Committee will wish to be assured about.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mike Ashley\n\n22 February 2022\n\nChair, Board Audit Committee\n\ncla\n\ny",

Attendance by members at Committee meetings is also shown opposite. Committee meetings were attended by representatives from management, including the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group Chief Internal Auditor, Group Chief Controls Officer, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Chief Operating Officer, Group General Counsel and Group Chief Compliance Officer, as well as representatives from the businesses and other functions, and from BBPLC senior management reflecting the partially consolidated operation of the BPLC and BBPLC Committee meetings.\n\nThe Committee is composed solely of independent Non-Executive Directors. Membership of the Committee is designed to provide the breadth of financial expertise and commercial acumen that the Committee needs to fulfil its responsibilities. Its members as a whole have recent and relevant experience of the banking and financial services sector, in addition to general management and commercial experience; and are financially literate. Mike Ashley, the Committee Chair, who is the designated financial expert on the Committee for the purposes of SOx, is a former audit partner who, during his executive career, acted as lead engagement partner on the audits of a number of large financial services groups. Having joined the Committee in April 2021, Julia Wilson has brought to the Committee significant financial, tax and accounting experience, coupled with strong financial services expertise. You can find more details of the experience of the current Committee members in their biographies on pages 112 to 115.\n\nThe lead audit engagement partner of KPMG, Michelle Hinchliffe, also attended Committee meetings. The Committee held a number of separate private sessions with each of the Group Chief Internal Auditor and the lead audit engagement partner during 2021, which were not attended by management.\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nMichelle Hinchliffe is standing down as lead audit engagement partner following the conclusion of the audit. The Committee has approved the appointment of Stuart Crisp of KPMG as the new lead engagement partner. The Committee would like to take this opportunity to express its thanks to Michelle for her work on behalf of shareholders and her contribution to the Committee's deliberations during her tenure as lead audit engagement partner.\n\nThe role of the Committee is to review and monitor, among other things:\n\n- \u25a0 the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls\n- \u25a0 the integrity of the Group's financial statements and related announcements\n- \u25a0 the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit processes\n- \u25a0 the effectiveness of the Group's whistleblowing procedures.\n- \u25a0 the Group's relationship with the external auditor\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are available at home.barclays/who-we-are/ our-governance/board-committees\n\n## Board Audit Committee\n\n| Member                  | Meetings  attended/eligible  to attend  (including ad hoc  meetings)   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mike Ashley             | 11/11                                                                  |\n| Tim Breedon             | 10/10                                                                  |\n| (until 31 October 2021) |                                                                        |\n| Diane Schueneman        | 11/11                                                                  |\n| Julia Wilson            | 8/8                                                                    |\n| (from 1 April 2021)     |                                                                        |\n\n## Committee members\n\n## Committee allocation of time\n\n<!-- image -->",

Michelle Hinchliffe of KPMG is Barclays' lead audit engagement partner and was appointed to this role with effect from the 2018 financial year. As noted above, Michelle Hinchliffe will be retiring from the role in 2022. Following detailed discussions with KPMG and the Committee's approval, Michelle's successor, Stuart Crisp, will be taking over from her as lead audit engagement partner with effect from February 2022.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for assessing the effectiveness, objectivity and independence of the Group's auditor, KPMG. This responsibility was discharged by the Committee throughout the year at formal meetings, during private meetings with KPMG and through discussions with key Group executives. In addition to the matters noted above, the Committee also:\n\n- \u25a0 discussed the Group policy on the Provision of Services by the Group Statutory Auditor (the Policy) and reviewed regular reports from management on the non-audit services provided by KPMG to Barclays\n- \u25a0 approved the terms of the audit engagement letter and associated fees, on behalf of the Board\n- \u25a0 evaluated and approved revisions to the Group policy on Engagement of Employees and Workers of the Statutory Auditor and ensured compliance with the policy by regularly assessing reports from management detailing any appointments made\n\n- \u25a0 was briefed by KPMG on critical accounting judgements and estimates and internal controls over financial reporting\n\nIn previous years, the FRC's Audit Quality Review (AQR) team had identified areas for improvement in KPMG's audit work, particularly in relation to its bank audits, and its documented audit approach and guidance for auditing the requirements of IFRS 9 including the minimum procedures to be performed. As noted last year, KPMG had invested significantly in this area and considered that, based on the steps it had already taken, it would be able to demonstrate improvements in its future year-end audits.\n\n- \u25a0 assessed any potential threats to independence that were self-identified and reported by KPMG.\n\nThe AQR did not review KPMG's audit of Barclays for the year ended 31 December 2020 but the FRC did walk through certain elements of KPMG's IFRS 13 audit work in connection with an assessment of progress against audit quality improvement action plans. The FRC walkthrough was not graded and while some areas for further enhancement were identified, improvements were noted as compared to previous AQR inspections. We welcome this constructive engagement between the FRC and KPMG.\n\nThe Committee had been satisfied with the degree of work that KPMG had proposed to undertake, noting incremental testing, particularly in areas identified as key audit matters. Further to this, KPMG informed us that, as a consequence of the FRC's observations in the aforementioned walkthrough, they have made additional improvements to their firm methodologies which have been applied to the current year's audit of Barclays.\n\nKPMG's performance, independence and objectivity during 2021 were also formally assessed at the beginning of 2022 by way of a questionnaire completed by key stakeholders across the Group, including the chairs of the Board Audit Committees of the Group's main operating companies (BBUKPLC, Barclays US LLC and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC). The questionnaire was designed to evaluate KPMG's audit process and addressed matters such as the quality of planning and communication, technical knowledge, the level of scrutiny and challenge applied and KPMG's understanding of the business.\n\nTaking into account the result of all of the above, the Committee considered that KPMG maintained its independence and objectivity and that the audit process was effective.\n\nIn addition, as in 2020, KPMG nominated a senior partner of the audit team reporting to the lead audit engagement partner to have specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality. The Committee therefore met with the partner concerned, without the lead audit engagement partner present, to receive a report on his assessment of audit quality.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nIn order to safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, Barclays has in place the Policy setting out the circumstances in which the auditor may be engaged to provide services other than those covered by the Group audit. The Policy applies to all Barclays' subsidiaries and other material entities over which Barclays has significant influence. The core principle of the Policy is that non-audit services (other than those legally required to be carried out by the Group's auditor) should be performed by the auditor only in certain controlled circumstances. The Policy sets out those types of services that are permitted (Permitted services). A summary of the Policy can be found at home.barclays/ who-we-are/our-governance/auditorindependence/",

The Policy is aligned with both the FRC's requirements and KPMG's own internal policy on non-audit services for FTSE 350 companies which broadly restricts non-audit work to services that are 'closely related' to the audit. During 2021, the Committee reviewed and approved the Policy in its current form on the basis it continued to reflect current applicable rules and guidelines and met the needs of the business. Any changes to the Policy are required to be approved at a Group level by the Committee. This is in accordance with laws applicable in the UK and FRC guidance, pursuant to which audit committees of Public Interest Entities (such as Barclays) are required to approve non-audit services provided by their auditors to such entities; and subsidiary Public Interest Entities in the UK - such as BBUKPLC and BBPLC - can rely on the approval of non-audit services by the ultimate parent's Board Audit Committee. Pursuant to the Policy, audit services and the fee cap are monitored by the relevant Board Audit Committee, as appropriate.\n\nUnder the Policy, except for specific categories of Permitted services that require explicit Committee approval, the Committee has pre-approved all Permitted services for which fees are less than \u00a3100,000. However, all proposed work, regardless of the amount of the fees, must be sponsored by a senior executive and recorded on a centralised online system, with a detailed explanation of the clear commercial benefit arising from engaging the auditor over other potential service providers. The lead audit engagement partner must also confirm that the engagement has been approved in accordance with the auditor's own internal ethical standards and does not pose any threat to the auditor's independence or objectivity. All requests to engage the auditor are assessed by independent management (who are not involved in any work to which the proposed engagement relates) before work can commence. Requests for Permitted service types in respect of which the fees are expected to meet or exceed the above threshold but expected to be less than \u00a3250,000 must be approved by the Chair of the Committee (or an appropriate alternate) before work is permitted to begin. Services where the fees are expected to be \u00a3250,000 or higher must be approved by the Committee as a whole. All expenses and disbursements must be included in the fees calculation.\n\nDuring 2021, all engagements for which expected fees met or exceeded the above thresholds were evaluated by either the Committee Chair or the Committee members as a whole, who, before confirming any approval, assured themselves that there was justifiable reason for engaging the auditor and that its independence and objectivity would not be threatened. No requests to use KPMG were declined by the Committee in 2021 (2020: none). On a quarterly basis, the Committee scrutinised details of individually approved and pre-approved services undertaken by KPMG in order to satisfy itself that they posed no risk to independence, either in isolation or on an aggregated basis.\n\nThe fees payable to KPMG for the year ended 31 December 2021 amounted to \u00a362m (2020: \u00a359m), of which \u00a312m (2020: \u00a312m) was payable in respect of non-audit services. A breakdown of the fees payable to the auditor for statutory audit and non-audit work can be found in Note 40 of the financial statements. Of the \u00a312m of non-audit services provided by KPMG during 2021, the significant categories of engagement, i.e. services where the fees amounted to more than \u00a3500,000, included:\n\nFor the purposes of the Policy, the Committee has determined that any pre-approved service of a value of under \u00a350,000 is to be regarded as trivial in terms of its impact on Barclays' financial statements and has required the Group Financial Controller to specifically review and confirm to the Committee that any pre-approved service with a value of between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3100,000 may be regarded as such. The Committee undertook a review of pre-approved services at its meeting in December 2021.\n\n- \u25a0 audit-related services: services in connection with CASS audits\n- \u25a0 other attestation and assurance services, such as ongoing attestation and assurance services for treasury and capital markets transactions to meet regulatory requirements, including regular reporting obligations and verification reports.\n- \u25a0 other services in connection with regulatory, compliance and internal control reports and specific audit procedures, required by law or regulation to be provided by the statutory auditor\n\n## The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014\n\nBarclays is in compliance with the requirements of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.\n\nAn external audit tender was conducted in 2015 and the decision was made to appoint KPMG as Barclays' external auditor with effect from the 2017 financial year, with PwC resigning as the Group's statutory auditor at the conclusion of the 2016 audit.\n\nAs explained in previous Committee reports, provided that KPMG continues to maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied with its performance, the Group has no intention of tendering for an alternative external auditor before the end of the current required period of 10 years. Accordingly, any tender would be in respect of the 2027 financial year onwards and is likely to take place in 2025. The Committee believes it would not be appropriate to tender before this date as it recognises that whilst it is important to ensure the audit firm remains objective and does not become overly familiar with management, there is an important balance to be struck with the investment of time required both from management and any completely new audit team for them to gain sufficient understanding  of such a large complex organisation to ensure a top quality audit. The Committee is also conscious that the lead engagement partner will have changed twice since KPMG's tenure and that there have also been significant changes of senior management - both of which serve to reduce any threat of overfamiliarity. The Committee will give further consideration over the next two years to its audit tendering strategy to take account, as appropriate, of the outcome of the UK audit reform proposals.",

Large stimulus measures such as UK furlough schemes and the corporate and SME loan schemes were extended into 2021, with the Committee keeping a close eye on the risks inherent with a tapering of these as well as the significant monetary stimulus provided by central banks. The Risk Committee remained watchful of the wider global implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside other macro themes, including the consequences of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the risk of a disorderly market correction, the evolving interest rate environment, US/China political tensions and other potential policy and geopolitical developments following the US Presidential election at the end of 2020.\n\nThe risks associated with climate change are increasingly well understood and, reflecting the importance of this global issue, Climate risk has been elevated to become a Principal Risk within our ERMF from 1 January 2022. The Committee began the year with a detailed training session on the financial and operational risks of climate change to enable the Committee to deepen its understanding of this complex and evolving risk. The training session covered Barclays' governance in this space, progress made over the preceding 12 months and areas of key focus for 2021 and beyond. The Committee considered both the scenarios and models used for the Climate Internal Stress Test. The training session assisted with the Committee's discussions around the methodology to be used for the BoE's industry-wide Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES), the results of which were approved by the Committee in September.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe Committee considered a broad range of potential impacts including evolving inflation expectations, unemployment rates, delayed defaults as support measures were withdrawn, and longer- term structural risks, including the significant increase in global indebtedness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second half of the year, the Committee focused on the continued improvement in the global economic outlook while considering the risks to the recovery from supply chain constraints and bouts of rising infection rates amid new strains of the virus. The Committee reviewed and approved the Group's Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) during the course of 2021, concluding that the Group was appropriately capitalised and had adequate liquidity resources. Economic conditions were such that no out-of-cycle refresh of either the ICAAP or the ILAAP was required.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor closely developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the changes in transmission of the virus and associated variants and the positive effects of the vaccine programme roll-outs.  The extension of government support schemes and stimulus measures assisted with a return to economic activity but the Committee monitored their removal carefully noting that this would be a risk to growth.\n\nThe Committee monitored the risks associated with the Government loan schemes and the withdrawal of those schemes, including the potential for fraud and the risks linked to collection and recoveries.\n\nThe Committee continued to review the evolving interest rate environment on the Group, receiving detailed updates on the Group's preparedness both operationally and financially for the potential for negative interest rates in response to regulatory requests. As sentiment pivoted towards the recovery and whether rising inflation was transitory or more structural given the combination of pent-up corporate and consumer demand and supply bottlenecks, the Committee shifted its focus to the risks of a more disorderly normalisation of policy rates.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor geopolitical risks, including in the Eurozone, as well as in China, in particular the market implications for the deteriorating relations between the US and China. These risks present a threat to global growth recovery efforts.\n\nThe Committee remained vigilant to the continued economic uncertainty of the UK's withdrawal from the EU following the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020. The Committee considered event risks that remained despite a trade deal being reached. It also considered the resulting fragility of the UK economy given the combination of macroeconomic factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as more idiosyncratic risks, including trade relations with the EU and beyond, as well as the potential for another independence referendum in Scotland.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nThe Committee continued to focus on Conduct risk, with key areas of focus including the heightened inherent risk associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (for example, Markets traders working from home), the impact of the transition away from LIBOR and adapting the Group's practices to comply with regulatory change. In addition to focusing on the Conduct risk profile of the Group's core businesses, the Committee also received reports on 'Lessons Learned' as a result of industry developments and events.",

The primary risk management tools used by management are the RCSAs.\n\nOperational risk remained heightened in 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Committee considered closely operational resilience, with a teach-in dedicated to the Group's approach to resilience and increased regulatory scrutiny and regulator expectations. The Committee also received briefings on the Group's approach to identifying important business services and their associated impact tolerances in advance of their final approval, expected in early 2022.\n\nThe RCSAs give 'day-to-day' coverage of the risk and control environment of the Group. They are built on a foundation of the actual processes the Group employs and the risks it faces from its activities. This approach enables management to improve identification and management of Operational risks going forward and also to review in detail risk events that have occurred in order to identify root causes.\n\n## Risk appetite and risk models\n\nDuring the year the Committee received detailed updates on key risk areas including cyber risk and the risk associated with the use of cryptocurrency to strengthen the Committee's understanding of the potential these risks pose and to understand how the Group continued to strengthen its oversight in these areas.\n\nOne of the most important roles of the Committee is to recommend to the Board an appropriate risk appetite for the Group. This represents the amount of risk the Group is able to take to earn an appropriate return while meeting minimum internal and regulatory capital requirements in a severe but plausible stress environment. The Committee analyses Barclays' performance in both its internally generated stress tests and those developed externally by such bodies as the BoE and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) in the US and, following such analysis, may recommend adjustments to the Group's overall risk profile.\n\nFor the Group's internal stress test, the Committee received a detailed briefing on the methodology approach and approved the internally generated scenario narrative theme and the macroeconomic projections that informed the scenario severity. The Committee was satisfied that the Group would meet internal and regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity in such a scenario.\n\n## Risk function\n\nThe Committee continued to oversee model risk management and the ongoing validation of the Group's models. The Group's models are the core foundation upon which the majority of its internal assessment processes run. The Committee noted the continued progress made during 2021 to embed the Model risk management framework as evidenced by an increasingly stable model inventory and further improvements in documentation and control. However, models remain a key risk area for the Group and the Committee is closely monitoring the development of the Group's approach and its regulators' expectations in this regard.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the Risk function, whose primary role is the oversight and challenge of risk taking as the second line of defence. It accomplishes this by establishing the policies, limits, rules and constraints under which activities of the first line of defence shall be performed, consistent with the Group's risk appetite and through monitoring the adherence of the first line of defence against these policies, limits and constraints. The Committee's responsibilities include (i) designing a consistent classification of the risks faced by the Group in order to organise their management and reporting, (ii) designing and operating the process of setting risk appetite and material limits for the Group as a whole and its main entities, (iii) setting or approving strategies for approvals of transactions, and those significant individual agreements, as well as (iv) establishing key controls requirements to which customerfacing areas of Barclays must adhere in the conduct of their businesses.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Risk function's own assessment of its capability in late 2021 which showed that the function continues to meet expectations in providing effective and independent oversight and identified areas for enhancement.\n\n## Compliance function\n\nThe Committee monitored the delivery of, and approved updates to, the Compliance function's Annual Plan for 2021 and approved the Annual Compliance Plan for 2022.\n\nThe purpose of the Compliance function is to strengthen the culture of Barclays by providing oversight of the management of Conduct risk. Compliance participates in the prevention, detection and management of breaches of applicable laws, rules, regulations and procedures and has a key role in helping Barclays achieve the right Conduct outcomes and evolve a conduct-focused culture. The Committee maintains oversight of the Compliance function, and supports the independence of the function from the operational functions to ensure that Compliance has sufficient authority, stature, resources and access to the management body.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe Board appointed CSA to facilitate the review. As part of the review, CSA conducted one-on-one interviews with each member of the Committee, the Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Finance Director, Group Chief Operating Officer, Group Chief Compliance Officer and Group Chief Internal Auditor. CSA also observed the September and October 2021 Committee meetings.\n\nThe 2021 Committee effectiveness review was externally facilitated, as required by the Code. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nFeedback from the review confirms that the Committee is operating effectively, considering Barclays' risk appetite and risk profile in a thoughtful and forensic way, with its core mandate well understood by its members and proactive challenge of management. It was noted that more recent additions to the Committee in 2019 and 2020 brought valuable markets insight and experience.\n\nA continued focus on the split of work between the Board and the Committee, and potential overlap between the work of the Committee and the subsidiary Board Risk Committees, was considered to be beneficial. Feedback noted that there was no undue duplication between the Committee and the Board Audit Committee.",

For the year ended 31 December 2021, and as at the date of this report, we are pleased to confirm that Barclays PLC has complied in full with the requirements of the Code. This section sets out how we comply with the Code.\n\n## Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules\n\nBy virtue of the information included in this Governance section of the Annual Report, we comply with the corporate governance statement requirements of the FCA's DTRs. Certain additional information that is required to be disclosed pursuant to DTR7.2.6 can be found on pages 156 to 161.\n\n## New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n\nBarclays is permitted by NYSE rules to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the US. However, any significant variations must be explained in Barclays' Form 20-F filing, which can be accessed from the Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR database  or on our website, home.barclays.\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\nOur governance is designed to deliver an effective and entrepreneurial Board which:\n\n## Role of the Board\n\n- \u25a0 is effective in providing challenge, advice and support to management\n- \u25a0 drives informed, collaborative and accountable decision-making\n- \u25a0 provides checks and balances and encourages constructive challenge\n- \u25a0 creates long-term sustainable value for our shareholders, having regard to the interests of all our other stakeholders.\n\n## Culture\n\nYou can read more about our governance in the context of the Board, including our Group-wide governance framework and how the Board discharged its responsibilities during 2021, on pages 117 to 123.\n\nThe Barclays Way sets out our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and is the Code of Conduct for everyone working at Barclays, providing a clear path for achieving a dynamic and positive culture within the Group.  You can read more about The Barclays Way in our ESG report on page 80.\n\nOur Group Whistleblowing Standard enables employees to raise any matters of concern anonymously and is embedded into our business. You can read more about Whistleblowing in the ESG report on page 93, and the role of the Board Audit Committee in reviewing and monitoring the Group's Whistleblowing policies on page 137.\n\nThe Board is fully supportive of The Barclays Way and our Purpose, Values and Mindset, and you can read more about Board's role in this area, including how the Board receives feedback on our culture through a number of channels to ensure it is aligned to our Purpose, Values and Mindset, on page 120.\n\n## Relations with shareholders and stakeholders\n\nOur comprehensive investor relations engagement helps to inform the Board about investors' views on Barclays, which are communicated regularly to the Board; and our Chairman engages with shareholders on governance and related matters. Our Investor Relations programme returned to a more normalised process in 2021, combining both virtual and in-person formats, as we adapted to new ways of working, allowing high-quality interaction in the ways our investors prefer.\n\nConsidering the views and interests of our stakeholders is an important part of the way in which the Board makes decisions and provides oversight and challenge. You can find more details about how the Board engages with stakeholders in our Section 172 Statement on page 16. You can also read more about how we engage with our stakeholders, including what they told us in 2021 and how we responded, in our Strategic report on pages 14 to 15.\n\nOur shareholder communication guidelines are available on our website at home.barclays/ investor-relations/shareholder-information/.\n\nIn 2021, the Directors, in conjunction with the senior executive team and Investor Relations colleagues, were able to participate in investor meetings, seminars and conferences across many locations, increasingly in person. We held conference calls and webcasts for our quarterly results briefings for both our equity and fixed income investors, and look forward to continuing this engagement through 2022.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nDuring 2021, discussions with investors included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 opportunities arising from the subsequent reopening of global economies, and the recovery in consumer and corporate activity\n- \u25a0 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Barclays, including macroeconomic effects of higher inflation and interest rates\n- \u25a0 drivers of sustained double-digit Group return on average tangible shareholders' equity (RoTE) post-COVID-19 pandemic",

Our Private Shareholder Relations team is also available to support with any feedback or questions from shareholders.  You can read more about our 2021 AGM on this page.\n\nMore information for shareholders is available on pages 105 to 106, which includes details on signing up to Shareview (which enables shareholders to easily manage their shareholdings and personal information online), receiving dividends electronically, how we return unclaimed funds to shareholders and useful contacts.\n\nThe Board shared the frustration of our shareholders that, like our 2020 AGM, the 2021 AGM was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and shareholders were unable to attend in person. The Board and the senior executive team consider our AGM to be an important event in our corporate calendar, providing a key opportunity for shareholder engagement, particularly with our private shareholders, and for shareholders to ask questions of the Board.\n\n## The 2021 AGM\n\nIn order to maximise shareholder engagement whilst respecting the COVID-19 restrictions and guidance in place at the time, in 2021 we held the AGM as a combined physical and electronic meeting (a 'hybrid' AGM) for the first time. This enabled shareholders to attend the 2021 AGM virtually using electronic facilities and to vote and raise questions in real time, either by telephone or using the electronic facilities. In addition to raising questions at the 2021 AGM itself, shareholders were able to submit questions to the Board in advance of the meeting, as in previous years. All questions received ahead of the 2021 AGM were answered individually and answers to frequently asked questions were published on our website ahead of the meeting.\n\nVoting on all of the resolutions at the 2021 AGM was conducted by way of a poll, thereby giving weight to the number of shares held by shareholders rather than simply attributing a notional one vote to each shareholder voting. With the exception of the shareholder requisitioned Resolution 29, all resolutions were passed with votes 'For' ranging from 91.54% to 99.97% of the total votes cast.\n\nA climate change resolution (Resolution 29) was requisitioned by a group of shareholders co-ordinated by Market Forces. The Board did not consider Resolution 29 to be in the best interests of BPLC and its shareholders as a whole, and recommended that shareholders vote against Resolution 29 for the following reasons (as detailed in the 2021 Notice of AGM available at home.barclays/investor-relations/ reports-and-events/general-meetings/):\n\nShareholders voted in favour of amending our Articles of Association (Articles) at the 2021 AGM to include, amongst other changes, specific provisions on how a hybrid general meeting can be conducted, to allow for maximum flexibility in how we might convene and conduct AGMs in future years.\n\n- \u25a0 firstly, our new climate change strategy was adopted in 2020 to align Barclays to the goals of the Paris Agreement\n- \u25a0 thirdly, the Board continued to believe that Barclays can make the greatest difference by supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, rather than by simply phasing out support for some of the clients who are most engaged in it.\n- \u25a0 secondly, meaningful progress in the 12 months leading to the 2021 AGM had been made to design, refine and embed our detailed approach across Barclays\n\nResolution 29, which was not supported by the Board, was not passed, and the level of shareholder support for it fell well short of the 75% majority required for it to pass. Only 14.04% of the votes cast were cast 'For' Resolution 29, representing 8.92% of the register.\n\nIn line with Barclays' announcement at the 2021 AGM to offer shareholders a 'Say on Climate', shareholders will be asked to vote on Barclays' climate strategy at the 2022 AGM. Further details of the 'Say on Climate' vote will be set out in the 2022 Notice of AGM.\n\n## The 2022 AGM\n\nOur plans remain, of course, subject to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any UK Government guidance or restrictions in place at the relevant time, but the Board very much hopes to be able to welcome shareholders to the 2022 AGM in person. Further details will be provided in our 2022 Notice of AGM.\n\nLooking ahead to the 2022 AGM, the Board currently intends to hold the AGM in Manchester on 4 May 2022 at 11:00am as a combined physical and electronic meeting, to allow for shareholders to attend and vote in person or virtually using electronic facilities, should they prefer.\n\nAs stated in our 2021 Notice of AGM, it is the Board's intention on an annual basis to alternate AGM venues between London and a venue other than London where Barclays has a significant business or customer presence.\n\nSeeking to understand all stakeholders' views, and the impact of our behaviour and business on our customers and clients, colleagues, suppliers, communities and society more broadly, is a key part of how the Board makes decisions and provides oversight and challenge. Accordingly, the Board monitors key indicators across areas such as culture, citizenship, conduct, and customer and client satisfaction on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe engaged extensively with shareholders and other stakeholders (including proxy advisory agencies and investor associations) in 2021 on key topics including strategic priorities, governance and succession planning, as well as further engagement on Barclays' climate strategy.\n\nFor further detail about how we engage with our stakeholders, including what they told us in 2021 and how we responded, please refer to our Strategic report on pages 14 to 15.  You can read more about how the Board engages with stakeholders in our Section 172 Statement on pages 16 to 19.\n\nThroughout 2021, we have engaged with our stakeholders through a variety of means including surveys, participation in forums and global and regional industry initiatives.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: How we comply continued\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nBarclays has a long-standing commitment to the importance and value of colleague engagement, and in 2021 we continued to listen to colleagues and keep them informed in a number of ways. This included conducting regular 'Here to Listen' employee surveys, first launched in 2020, to make sure we were staying abreast of colleague feedback during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as our annual 'Your View' employee survey.\n\nOur colleagues are critical to our success, and the Board recognises that our continued investment in them protects and strengthens our culture.\n\nYou can read more about our commitment to our colleagues and our workforce engagement, including survey results and how we continue to support our colleagues, in the Our people and culture section on pages 29 to 34 and in our Strategic report on pages 14 to 15.\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and BPLC Articles, the Board has the authority to authorise conflicts of interest and this ensures that the influence of third parties does not compromise the independent judgement of the Board. Directors are required to declare any potential or actual conflicts of interest that could interfere with their ability to act in the best interests of the Group.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Group Company Secretary maintains a conflicts register, which is a record of actual and potential conflicts, together with any Board authorisation of the conflicts. The authorisations are for an indefinite period but are reviewed annually by the Nominations Committee, which also considers the effectiveness of the process for authorising Directors' conflicts of interest. The Board retains the power to vary or terminate these authorisations at any time.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\nExecutive and Non-Executive Directors share the same duties. However, in line with the principles of the Code, a clear division of responsibilities has been established.\n\n## Roles on the Board\n\nThe Chair is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 demonstrating objective judgement\n- \u25a0 leading the Board and its overall effectiveness\n- \u25a0 promoting a culture of openness and constructive challenge and debate between all Directors\n- \u25a0 ensuring Directors receive accurate, clear and timely information.\n- \u25a0 facilitating constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all NonExecutive Directors\n\nResponsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group is delegated to the Group Chief Executive, who is supported in this role by the ExCo. You can find further information on the membership of the ExCo on page 116.\n\nOur Non-Executive Directors provide effective oversight and scrutiny, strategic guidance and constructive challenge, holding the Executive Directors to account against their agreed performance objectives. The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Nominations Committee, have primary responsibility for the appointment and removal of the Executive Directors.\n\nAs a Board we have set out our expectations of each Director in Barclays' Charter of Expectations . This includes role profiles and the behaviours and competencies required for each role on the Board, namely the Chair, Deputy Chair (to the extent one is required), the SID, Non-Executive Directors, Executive Directors and Committee Chairs.\n\nThe SID provides a sounding board for the Chair, acting as an intermediary for the other Directors when necessary. Our SID is available to shareholders should they have concerns that have not been addressed through the normal engagement channels.\n\nA copy of the Charter of Expectations can be found at home.barclays/who-we-are/ourgovernance/board-responsibilities\n\nThe Charter of Expectations is reviewed annually to ensure it remains relevant and accurately reflects the requirements of the Code, the Regulations and industry best practice.\n\n## Information provided to the Board\n\nThroughout the year, both the Executive Directors and senior executives kept the Board informed of key business developments through regular updates. These are in addition to the presentations that the Board and Board Committees receive as part of their formal meetings. Where required to enable them to fulfil their obligations as members of the Board, Directors are able to seek independent and professional advice at Barclays' expense.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Chair to set the Board agenda, primarily focused on strategy, performance, value creation, culture, stakeholders and accountability, and to ensure that Board members receive timely and high-quality information to enable them to make sound decisions and promote the success of BPLC. Working in collaboration with the Chair, the Group Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good governance and information flow, to ensure an effective Board.",

In 2021, attendance was very strong both at scheduled meetings and the ad hoc meeting (called at short notice), as reflected in the table below. The Chairman met privately, on a quarterly basis, with each Non-Executive Director. If, owing to exceptional circumstances, a Director was not able to attend a Board meeting, the relevant Director ensured that their views were made known to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. The attendance record of Directors at scheduled and ad hoc meetings during 2021 is a testament to the commitment of each of our current Directors.\n\n| Board attendance in 2021   | Independent/Executive   | Scheduled  Meetings  eligible to  attend   | Scheduled  Meetings  attended   | % attendance   | Ad hoc  Meetings  eligible to  attend   | Ad hoc  Meetings  attended   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Chairman                   |                         |                                            |                                 |                |                                         |                              |\n| Nigel Higgins              | On appointment a        | 14                                         | 14                              | 100%           | 1                                       | 1                            |\n| Executive Directors        |                         |                                            |                                 |                |                                         |                              |\n| C.S.

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: How we comply continued\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Code, a majority of the Board is comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors. The independence of our Non-Executive Directors is considered by the Nominations Committee on an annual basis, having regard to the independence criteria set out in the Code. As part of this process, our Nominations Committee keeps under review the length of tenure of all Directors, which can affect independence, and makes any recommendations to the Board accordingly.\n\nIn the case of Tim Breedon, having undertaken a rigorous review of his performance as a Non-Executive Director and taking into account other relevant factors that might be considered likely to impair, or could appear to impair, independence including as set out in Provision 10 of the Code, the Nominations Committee and the Board consider Tim to be independent.\n\nThe independence of Mike Ashley, Crawford Gillies and Diane Schueneman, all of whom have served on the Board for more than six years, and Tim Breedon who has served on the Board for more than nine years, was subjected to a more rigorous review.  The Nominations Committee remains satisfied that the lengths of their tenure have no impact on their respective levels of independence or the effectiveness of their contributions. The Nominations Committee and the Board consider all of the Non-Executive Directors to be independent.\n\nDuring 2021, both Jes Staley and Sir Ian Cheshire stepped down from the Board. Neither raised any concerns about the operation of the Board or management.\n\nYou can read more about changes to Board composition and steps taken to further strengthen the Board and consideration of Non-Executive Director independence, including the Nomination Committee's review of Tim Breedon's independence and the appointment of Robert Berry in 2022, in the report of our Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nIn addition, all Directors must seek approval (providing an indication of expected time commitments) before accepting any significant new commitment outside of Barclays. Prior to approving any significant new external commitment for a Director, the Board undertakes a review of all relevant facts and circumstances, including the role and time commitment involved and the nature of the external organisation. In 2021, all external appointment requests were approved on the basis that the Board was comfortable with any actual or potential conflicts and the Board was confident that the Director in question remained able to devote such time necessary to discharge their duties to Barclays effectively.\n\nAll potential new Directors are asked to disclose their other significant commitments. The Nominations Committee then takes this into account when considering a proposed appointment to ensure that Directors can discharge their responsibilities to Barclays effectively. This means not only attending and preparing for formal Board and Board Committee meetings, but also making time to understand the business and to undertake training. The time commitment is agreed with each Non-Executive Director on an individual basis.\n\nSet out on this page is the average time commitment expected for the role of NonExecutive Directors and the other NonExecutive positions on the Board.\n\n## Expected time commitment\n\n| Role                          | Expected time  commitment                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chair                         | Equivalent of up to  80% of full-time  position.                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Senior  Independent  Director | As required to fulfil  the role.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Non-Executive  Director       | 35-40 days per year  (membership of one  Board Committee  included, increasing  to 50 days a year if                                                                                                 |\n| Committee Chairs              | member of two  Board Committees).

The Group Company Secretary maintains a record of each Director's commitments. For the year ended 31 December 2021 and as at the date of publication, the Board is satisfied that none of the Directors is over-committed and that each of the Directors allocates sufficient time to their role in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively.",

        "page_content": "## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## Board appointments\n\nWe have a Nominations Committee, the purpose and activities of which are contained in the report of our Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\nAll Board and senior management appointments are viewed through a diversity lens and are based on merit and objective criteria, which focus on the skills and experience required for the Board's effectiveness and the delivery of the Group strategy. Board appointments are made following a rigorous and transparent process facilitated by the Nominations Committee, with the aid of external search consultancy firms.\n\nYou can read more about diversity at Board level in the report of our Nominations Committee on page 127, and about Barclays' continued commitment to diversity and inclusion in Our people and culture section on pages 29 to 34.\n\nThe Board adopted a revised version of the Board Diversity Policy on 9 February 2021, re-affirming the existing gender diversity target (33% female) and adopting a new ethnic diversity target aligned with the Parker Review on the ethnic diversity of UK Boards (at least one Board member to be a Person of Colour). The Board reconfirmed its commitment to these targets on 9 February 2022.\n\nThe composition of the Board, Board Committees and the ExCo is regularly reviewed by the Nominations Committee. It frequently considers the skills required for the Board, Board Committees and the ExCo, identifying the core competencies, diversity and experience required. This, along with the annual effectiveness evaluation, helps to refresh the thinking on Board, Board Committee and ExCo composition and to determine a timeline for proposed new appointments. For the Board, it is standard practice to appoint any new NonExecutive Director or Chair for an initial three-year term, subject to annual re-election at the AGM, which may be extended for up to a further three-year term. As such, Non-Executive Directors typically serve up to a minimum of six years but this period may be extended where the Nominations Committee considers it appropriate.\n\nAll Directors are subject to election or reelection (as appropriate) each year by shareholders at the AGM.\n\nEach year, we carry out an effectiveness review in order to evaluate our performance, as a Board, as well as the performance of each of the Board Committees and individual Directors. You can read more about the 2021 Board, Board Committee and Individual Effectiveness review, which was externally facilitated (as required by the Code), in the report of our Nominations Committee on pages 129 to 130.\n\nThe service contracts for the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment for the Group Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at our registered office and at the AGM.\n\nYou can find biographies for each member of the Board, including details of their relevant skills, experience and contribution, Board Committee memberships and other principal appointments on pages 112 to 115.  Details of changes to the Board in 2021 and up to the date of this report, together with details of Board appointments, tenure, independence and succession planning are disclosed in the report of our Nominations Committee on pages 124 to 130.\n\n## Induction\n\nFollowing their appointments to the Board in 2021, Venkat and Julia Wilson each received tailored inductions. Robert Berry's induction is in progress, following his appointment to the Board on 8 February 2022. You can read more about their inductions, Dawn Fitzpatrick's induction to the Board Remuneration Committee and Brian Gilvary's briefings in relation to his role as Board Remuneration Committee Chair and responsibilities as SID in the report of our Nominations Committee on page 128.\n\nOn appointment to the Board, all Directors receive a comprehensive induction that is tailored to the new Director's individual requirements. The induction schedule is designed to provide the new Director with an understanding of how the Group works and the key issues that it faces. The Group Company Secretary consults the Chair when designing a bespoke induction schedule, taking into account the particular needs of a new Director. When a Director is joining a Board Committee, the schedule includes an induction to the operation of that committee.\n\n## Training and development\n\nWhilst opportunities for in-person Director training remained limited in 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing social distancing guidance, training and development was supported through the Board deep dives, briefings for Board members on key risk topics, and Function reviews described on page 122.\n\nIn order to support the effective contribution by Board and Board Committee members, we regularly provide Directors with the opportunity to take part in ongoing training and development. Directors can also request specific training, as required.\n\nThe Board also received an annual briefing on regulatory responsibilities, including the Senior Managers Regime and on Barclays' conduct and financial crime policies and standards.\n\nThe Nominations Committee supports the Chair in developing and monitoring effective induction, training and development for the Board, and you can read more on pages 128 to 129.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report: How we comply continued\n\n## Audit, Risk and Internal Control\n\nInternal governance processes have been developed to ensure the effective operation of the individual Boards and Board Committees of each of BPLC, BBUKPLC and BBPLC respectively, in recognition of the fact that this is key to the development and execution of the Group's strategy. Generally, there is one set of rules for the Group. Group-wide frameworks, policies and standards are adopted throughout the Group unless local laws or regulations (for example, the ring-fencing obligations applicable to BBUKPLC) require otherwise, or the ExCo decides otherwise in a particular instance.\n\n## Accountability\n\nThe Board has a Board Audit Committee and a Board Risk Committee. The purposes and activities of the Board Audit and Board Risk Committees are contained within their respective reports on pages 131 and 140 respectively.\n\nThe Board, together with the Board Audit Committee, is responsible for ensuring the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions. For this reason, the Board Audit Committee members met regularly with the Group Chief Internal Auditor and the KPMG lead audit engagement partner, without management present. The appointment and removal of the Group Chief Internal Auditor is a matter reserved to the Board Audit Committee and the appointment, and removal, of the external auditor, is a matter reserved to the Board. Neither task is delegated to management. More detail is provided on pages 137 to 139 of the Board Audit Committee report.\n\n## Internal and external audit functions\n\n## Company's position and prospects\n\nThe Board, together with the Board Audit Committee, is responsible for ensuring the integrity of this Annual Report and that the financial statements as a whole present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of our performance, position and prospects. This is explained in detail on page 134 of the Board Audit Committee report.\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nThe Group is committed to operating within a strong system of internal control. Barclays has an overarching framework that sets out the approach of the Group to internal governance, The Barclays Guide . This establishes the mechanisms, principles and processes through which management implements the strategy set by the Board.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for ensuring that management maintains an effective system of risk management and internal control and for assessing its effectiveness. Such a system is designed to identify, evaluate and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nProcesses are in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the Principal Risks facing the Group in accordance with the 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting', published by the FRC. A key component of The Barclays Guide is the ERMF. The purpose of the ERMF is to identify and set minimum requirements in respect of the main risks to the strategic objectives of the Group. There are nine Principal Risks under the ERMF: Credit risk, Market risk, Treasury and Capital risk, Operational risk, Climate risk, Model risk, Reputation risk, Conduct risk and Legal risk. The system of risk management and internal control is set out in the risk frameworks relating to each of our nine Principal Risks and the Barclays Control Framework, which details requirements for the delivery of control responsibilities. Group-wide frameworks, policies and standards enable Barclays to meet regulators' expectations relating to internal control and assurance.\n\nKey controls are assessed on a regular basis for both design and operating effectiveness. Issues arising out of these assessments, where appropriate, are reported to the Board Audit Committee. The Board Audit Committee oversees the control environment (and remediation of related issues) and you can read more about its work on pages 131 to 139. The Board Audit Committee also reviews annually the risk management and internal control system, which includes the ERMF. It has concluded that, throughout the year ended 31 December 2021 and to date, the Group has operated a sound system of internal control that provides reasonable assurance of financial and operational controls and compliance with laws and regulations. For more details on that evaluation and its conclusions please see page 137.\n\n## Effectiveness of internal controls\n\nThe review of the effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control is achieved through reviewing the effectiveness of the frameworks, principles and processes contained within The Barclays Guide , the ERMF and the Barclays Control Framework.\n\nFurther details of risk management procedures and material existing and emerging risks are given in the Risk review and Risk management sections on pages 200 to 294.\n\nRegular reports are made by management to the Board Risk Committee and the Board covering significant risks, measurement methodologies and appropriate risk appetite for the Group.\n\n## Controls over financial reporting\n\nSpecific governance committees are responsible for examining the financial reports and disclosures to ensure that they have been subject to adequate verification and comply with applicable standards and legislation.\n\nA framework of disclosure controls and procedures is in place to support the approval of the financial statements of the Group.\n\nWhere appropriate, these committees report their conclusions to the Board Audit Committee, which debates such conclusions and provides further challenge. Finally, the Board scrutinises and approves results announcements and the Annual Report and ensures that appropriate disclosures have been made. This governance process ensures that both management and the Board are given sufficient opportunity to debate and challenge the financial statements of the Group and other significant disclosures before they are made public.\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements, in accordance with (a) UK-adopted international accounting standards; and (b) International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting",

        "page_content": "Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail:\n\n- \u25a0 provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and the respective Directors\n- \u25a0 accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets\n- \u25a0 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nManagement has assessed the internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021. In making its assessment, management utilised the criteria set out in the 2013 COSO framework and concluded that, based on its assessment, the internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 31 December 2021.\n\nInternal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nThe system of internal financial and operational controls is also subject to regulatory oversight in the UK and overseas. Further information on supervision by the financial services regulators is provided under Supervision and Regulation in the Risk review section on pages 289 to 294.\n\nThere have been no changes that occurred during the period covered by this report, which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for the consideration and approval of the remuneration arrangements of the Chairman, the Executive Directors, other senior executives and certain Group employees to the Board Remuneration Committee. The Board Remuneration Committee, when considering the remuneration policies and practices, seeks to ensure that they support our strategy and promote the long-term success of the business and that they are aligned to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy.\n\nWe have a Board Remuneration Committee, the purpose and activities of which are described in the Remuneration report on pages 162 to 199.\n\nAll executive and senior management remuneration policies are developed in accordance with the Group's formal and transparent procedures (ensuring that no Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome) and having regard to workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture.\n\nYou can find further information on the purpose of the Board Remuneration Committee and its activities in 2021 in the Remuneration report on pages 162 to 199.\n\nAll Board Remuneration Committee members demonstrate independent judgement and discretion when determining and approving remuneration outcomes. The Board as a whole, with the Non-Executive Directors abstaining, considers annually the fees paid to NonExecutive Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Appointment and retirement of Directors\n\nThe Articles may be amended only by a special resolution of the shareholders. The Board has the power to appoint additional Directors or to fill a casual vacancy among the Directors and any Director so appointed holds office only until the next AGM and may offer himself/herself for re-election. The Code recommends that all directors of FTSE 350 companies should be subject to annual re-election. All Directors, who will be continuing in office, and Anna Cross in her capacity as a Director from 23 April 2022, intend to offer themselves for election or re-election (as appropriate) at the  2022 AGM.\n\nThe appointment and retirement of Directors is governed by our Articles, the Code, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2021 for the benefit of the then directors, and at the date of this report are in force for the benefit of directors of Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited as trustee of the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, and Barclays Executive Schemes Trustees Limited as Trustee of Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. The directors of the trustees are indemnified against liability incurred in connection with the trustees' activities in relation to the Barclays Bank UK Retirement Fund, Barclays Capital International Pension Scheme (No.1) and Barclays PLC Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme.\n\n'Qualifying third party indemnity' provisions (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2021 for the benefit of the then Directors of the Company and the then Directors of certain of the Company's subsidiaries and, at the date of this report, are in force for the benefit of the Directors of the Company and the Directors of certain of the Company's subsidiaries in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur (or have incurred) in connection with their duties, powers or office. The Group also maintains Directors' & Officers' Liability Insurance which gives appropriate cover for legal action brought against its Directors.\n\n## Political donations\n\n## Country-by-Country reporting\n\nThe Group did not give any money for political purposes in the UK or outside the UK, nor did it make any political donations to political parties or other political organisations or to any independent election candidates, nor did it incur any political expenditure during the year. In accordance with the US Federal Election Campaign Act, Barclays provides administrative support to a federal Political Action Committee (PAC) in the US, funded by the voluntary political contributions of eligible employees. The PAC is not controlled by Barclays and all decisions regarding the amounts and recipients of contributions are directed by a steering committee comprising employees eligible to contribute to the PAC. Contributions to political organisations reported by the PAC during the calendar year 2021 totalled $29,000 (2020 $113,500).\n\nThe Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country reporting) Regulations 2013 require the Company to publish additional information in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. This information is available on the Barclays website: home.barclays/annualreport.\n\n## Environment\n\nIn 2020, we disclosed that we were already net zero from our own operations, based on the common understanding at that time, that 'net zero' and 'carbon neutral' were interchangeable terms. To reflect the most recent interpretations of both of these terms in public discourse, we will make a distinction between net zero operations and carbon neutral in our disclosures from now on. The standards available to understand and define net zero are rapidly evolving. We will continue to review and develop our own approach to net zero operations as this subject area matures.\n\nAs part of its ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, Barclays is working to achieving net zero operations 1 and supply chain emissions. Barclays has been carbon neutral for its Scope 1 2, Scope 2 3 and Scope 3 (business travel) 4 emissions since 2020. We are defining net zero operations as the state in which we will achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by at least 90%, against a 2018 baseline, and use carbon removals to eliminate any residual operational emissions that we cannot yet abate. We are defining carbon neutral as first reducing carbon dioxide emissions then counterbalancing carbon dioxide emissions  for scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 business travel with carbon offsets.\n\nWe have been carbon neutral since 2020 by reducing or eliminating sources of carbon dioxide emissions associated with our operations and business travel and by\n\ncompensating any remaining emissions by purchasing carbon credits under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS). We intend to remain carbon neutral, while investing in the continued decarbonisation of our operations and in the development of a net zero pathway for the emissions from our supply chain.\n\n## Progress to date\n\nIn line with our commitment to offer shareholders a 'Say on Climate', we will be publishing an update on our climate strategy, targets and methodology in advance of the 2022 AGM. This will include 2030 targets for two new sectors, Cement and Metals (Steel). Further details of the 'Say on Climate' vote will be set out in the 2022 Notice of AGM.\n\nWe are transforming the way we operate by switching to renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency, adopting new ways of working and removing fossil fuels from our campuses. In 2021, 94% of the electricity used across our global property portfolio came from renewable sources. The transition to renewable sources of energy contributed to Barclays exceeding its target of 80% GHG emissions reduction for scope 1 and scope 2 (marketbased) emissions by achieving an 86% reduction in 2021. At the same time as continuing our transition to renewable electricity, we intend to decarbonise our global property portfolio by progressively eliminating the use of fossil fuels currently used to heat and cool our buildings. We will continue removing the use of natural gas in our buildings, replacing gas boilers with carbon-free heating technologies when feasible. We will also continue to embed circular economy principles to reduce waste in our buildings and support the regeneration of natural systems.\n\nWe have disclosed global GHG emissions and energy use data as required by the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. See the ESG Data Hub for further details on our annual operational GHG emissions since 2018, including our scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 business travel location-based and marketbased emissions. We further provide insights on our annual waste production, energy and water consumption and renewable electricity consumption by country. You may find extensive information relating to how we track our operational footprint at: home.barclays/ sustainability/esg-resource-hub/\n\n- 1   Operations include company cars, offices, retail branches and data centres where Barclays have operational control.\n- 3   Scope 2 emissions include our indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity and purchased steam and chilled water.\n- 2   Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants.\n- 4   Scope 3 business travel emissions are our indirect emissions from commercial air travel and other transport.",

We have adopted the operational control approach to define our reporting boundary. Emissions from leased buildings where Barclays do not manage the utility are excluded. Where Barclays is responsible for the utility costs, these emissions are included. Estimating the GHG emissions of working from home is a new activity with little or no precedent and with no common standard which is why we have not yet included it in our annual GHG inventory. We are evaluating different methodologies to estimate our remote working emissions moving forward. For 2021, we have applied the latest emission factors available at the time of reporting. We continuously review and update our performance data based on updated carbon emission factors, improvements in data quality and updates to estimates previously applied. We have recalculated this information from our previous 2020 reporting year. Where the recalculation of our performance using updated carbon emissions factors and improvements in data quality and estimates has resulted in a change of more than 5% we have represented these figures in the table above. In 2021, we conducted a review of our GHG emissions inventory for scope 1 and scope 2 to improve the transparency of our public emissions disclosure. Historically, Barclays have chosen to account for third party managed data centres under Scope 1 and Scope 2. Based on our review, and with due regard to the GHG Protocol Guidelines and Operational Control definitions, we have updated our GHG accounting policy and reallocated the emissions of third party managed data centres under scope 3 'downstream leased assets', which will be reported in future. This reallocation is reflective of our limited control over energy sources at third party managed data centres. We have therefore re-baselined our historic emissions for 2018 and updated our reported figures for subsequent years. The previously reported scope 2 (location based) emissions were: 2018 (203,100 tCO2e), 2019 (182,000 tCO2e) and 2020 (159,500 tCO2e). In addition, a correction to underlying fugitive consumption data was identified, which has resulted in an adjustment to 2018-2020 fugitives emissions. The previously reported scope 1 emissions were: 2018 (25,900 tCO2e), 2019 (23,800 tCO2e) and 2020 (18,800 tCO2e).\n- a The carbon reporting year for our GHG emissions is 1 October to 30 September. The carbon reporting year is not fully aligned to the financial reporting year covered by this Directors' Report. Details of our approach to assurance over the data is set out in the 2021 Barclays Strategic Report.\n- c Scope 1 emissions include our direct GHG emissions from natural gas, fuel oil, company cars and HFC refrigerants. In the case of company-owned vehicles, emissions are limited to UK vehicles only as this is the only country in which the Group owns vehicles.\n- e  Scope 3 covers indirect emissions from business travel only. Business travel for these purposes compromises of: global flights and ground transport within the UK, US and India, however, in the case of the US and India ground transport covers onwards car hire only which has been provided directly by the supplier).  Ground transportation data (excluding Scope 1 emissions from company-owned vehicles) covers only countries where robust data is available directly from the supplier.\n- d  Scope 2 GHG emissions include our direct GHG emissions from purchased electricity, purchased heat, cooling and steam . Market-based emissions have been reported for 2020 and 2021. We have used a zero emission factor where we have green tariffs or energy attribute certificates in place in the UK, US, Hong Kong, Japan, India Singapore and Continental Europe. Where we are not consuming renewable electricity we have used the appropriate residual mix factor for the country in question.\n- f Intensity ratio calculations have been calculated using location-based emission factors only.\n- \u00b7 we have reduced our Group energy consumption by 7.5% versus 2020 due to reduced operating hours of our offices as our global workforce continued to work remotely as a result of COVID-19 in addition to a number of energy optimisation and efficiency initiatives in 2021, achieving a total reduction of 1.4 GWh since implementation.\n- g  Energy consumption data is captured through utility billing; meter reads or estimates. Principal measures we have undertaken in 2021 to improve energy efficiency include the following:\n- \u00b7 our energy efficiency measures for 2021 can be broken down by principal categories such as end of life asset replacement  projects saving 46 MWh; a 760 MWh saving from building optimisation projects; 397 MWh saving from adjusting our HVAC systems to align with reduced operational hours of our buildings globally; a 52 MWh saving from the installation of our brand new solar self-generation plant in Pune, India and installation of LED lighting together with power optimisation activities in select buildings which have achieved a combined 171 MWh saving.\n- \u0394  2021 data subject to independent Limited Assurance under ISAE(UK)3000 and ISAE3410.

        "page_content": "## Share capital\n\nThe Company has ordinary shares in issue. The Company's Articles also allow for the issuance of sterling, US dollar, euro and yen preference shares (preference shares). No preference shares have been issued as at 21 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report). Ordinary shares therefore represent 100% of the total issued share capital as at 31 December 2021 and as at 21  February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report).\n\n## Share capital structure\n\nDetails of the movement in ordinary share capital during the year can be found in Note 28 on page 396.\n\nEvery member who is present in person or represented at any general meeting of the Company, and who is entitled to vote, has one vote on a show of hands. Every proxy present has one vote. The proxy will have one vote for, and one vote against, a resolution if he/she has been instructed to vote for, or against, the resolution by different members or in one direction by a member while another member has permitted the proxy discretion as to how to vote.\n\n## Voting\n\nOn a poll, every member who is present or represented and who is entitled to vote has one vote for every share held. In the case of joint holders, only the vote of the senior holder (as determined by the order in the share register) or his/her proxy may be counted. If any sum payable remains unpaid in relation to a member's shareholding, that member is not entitled to vote that share or exercise any other right in relation to a meeting of the Company unless the Board otherwise determines.\n\nIf any member, or any other person appearing to be interested in any of the Company's ordinary shares, is served with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 and does not supply the Company with the information required in the notice, then the Board, in its absolute discretion, may direct that that member shall not be entitled to attend or vote at any meeting of the Company. The Board may further direct that, if the shares of the defaulting member represent 0.25% or more of the issued shares of the relevant class, dividends or other monies payable on those shares shall be retained by the Company until the direction ceases to have effect and no transfer of those shares shall be registered (other than certain specified 'excepted transfers'). A direction ceases to have effect seven days after the Company has received the information requested, or when the Company is notified that an excepted transfer of all of the relevant shares to a third party has occurred, or as the Board otherwise determines.\n\n## Transfers\n\nThe Board is not bound to register a transfer of partly paid ordinary shares or fully paid shares in exceptional circumstances approved by the FCA. The Board may also decline to register an instrument of transfer of certificated ordinary shares unless it is (i) duly stamped, deposited at the prescribed place and accompanied by the share certificate(s) and such other evidence as reasonably required by the Board to evidence right to transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of shares only, and (iii) it is in favour of a single transferee or not more than four joint transferees (except in the case of executors or trustees of a member).\n\nOrdinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Certificated ordinary shares may be transferred in writing in any usual or other form approved by the Group Company Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated ordinary shares must be made in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the CREST Regulations.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of section 84 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015, preference shares may be issued only in registered form. Preference shares shall be transferred in writing in any usual or other form approved by the Group Company Secretary and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. The Company's registrar shall register such transfers of preference shares by making the appropriate entries in the register of preference shares. Each preference share shall confer, in the event of a winding up or any return of capital by reduction of capital (other than, unless otherwise provided by their terms of issue, a redemption or purchase by the Company of any of its issued shares, or a reduction of share capital), the right to receive out of the surplus assets of the Company available for distribution among the members and in priority to the holders of the ordinary shares and any other shares in the Company ranking junior to the relevant series of preference shares and pari passu with any other class of preference shares (other than any class of shares then in issue ranking in priority to the relevant series of preference shares), repayment of the amount paid up or treated as paid up in respect of the nominal value of the preference share together with any premium which was paid or treated as paid when the preference share was issued in addition to an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\n## Limitations on foreign shareholders\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. The rights of shares shall not (unless expressly provided by the rights attached to such shares) be deemed varied by the creation of further shares ranking equally with them or subsequent to them.\n\nThere are no restrictions imposed by the Articles or (subject to the effect of any economic sanctions that may be in force from time to time) by current UK laws which relate only to non-residents of the UK and which limit the rights of such non-residents to hold or (when entitled to do so) vote the ordinary shares.\n\nEmployee Benefit Trusts (EBTs) operate in connection with certain of the Group's Employee Share Plans (Plans). The trustees of the EBTs may exercise all rights attached to the shares in accordance with their fiduciary duties other than as specifically restricted in the documents governing the Plans. The trustees of the EBTs have informed the Company that their normal policy is to abstain from voting in respect of the Barclays shares held in trust. The trustees of the Global Sharepurchase EBT and UK Sharepurchase EBT may vote in respect of Barclays shares held in the EBTs, but only as instructed by participants in those Plans in respect of their partnership shares and (when vested) matching and dividend shares. The trustees will not otherwise vote in respect of shares held in the Sharepurchase EBTs.\n\n## Exercisability of rights under an employee share scheme\n\n## Special rights\n\nThere are no persons holding securities that carry special rights with regard to the control of the Company.",

Part of the holding is held as American Depositary Receipts. On 8 February  2022, BlackRock, Inc. disclosed by way of a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC beneficial ownership of 1,401,752,691  ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2021, representing 8.4% of that class of shares.\n- a The percentage of voting rights detailed above was calculated at the time of the relevant disclosures made in accordance with Rule 5 of the DTRs.\n- c Qatar Holding LLC is wholly owned by Qatar Investment Authority. On 2 February 2022, Qatar Investment Authority disclosed by way of a Schedule 13G filed with the SEC beneficial ownership of 847,620,690 ordinary shares of the Company as at 31 December 2021, representing 5.06% of that class of shares.\n\nBetween 31 December 2021 and 21 February 2022 (the latest practicable date for inclusion in this report), the Company has not received any additional notifications pursuant to Rule 5 of the DTRs.\n\nThe powers of the Directors are determined by the Companies Act 2006 and the Company's Articles. The Directors are authorised to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares subject to annual shareholder approval at the AGM. Such authorities were granted by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. It will be proposed at the 2022 AGM that the Directors be granted new authorities to allot and buy back shares.\n\n## Powers of Directors to issue or buy back the Company's shares\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nOn 19 March 2021 and 2 August 2021 the Company commenced share buy-back programmes to purchase its ordinary shares of \u00a30.25p each up a maximum consideration of \u00a3700m and \u00a3500m, respectively, The first share buy-back programme concluded on 23 April 2021 and the second share buy-back programme concluded on 30 November 2021. The Company repurchased 377,356,751 ordinary shares at a volume weighted average price of 185.5008 pence per share during the first buy-back programme and 266,987,647 ordinary shares at a volume weighted average price of 187.2746 pence per share during the second buy-back programme. The purpose of the buy-back programmes was to reduce the Company's number of outstanding ordinary shares.\n\nIn aggregate, the Company purchased 644,344,398 ordinary shares during 2021 with a nominal value of  \u00a3161m (this represented 3.84% of the Company's issued share capital as at 31 December 2021) for an aggregate consideration of \u00a31,200m excluding taxes and expenses. All of the repurchased ordinary shares have been cancelled.\n\n## Distributable Reserves\n\nNo further shares have been repurchased since the completion of the second share buyback programme on 30 November 2021. The maximum number of ordinary shares which could be repurchased by the Company as part of any share buy-back under the authority for on-market share buy-backs granted at the 2021 AGM is 1,469,543,259 ordinary shares (being 1,736,530,906 less the 266,987,647 shares repurchased as part of the second share buy-back programme).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the distributable reserves of the Company were \u00a320,750m (2020: \u00a324,386m).\n\nThere are no significant agreements to which the Company is a party that are affected by a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.\n\n## Change of control\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nEach Director confirms that, so far as he/she is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which our auditor is unaware and that each of the Directors has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself/herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that our auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given pursuant to section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 and should be interpreted in accordance with, and subject to, those provisions.\n\nThe following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the Auditor's report set out on pages 314 to 330, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditor in relation to the accounts.\n\nThe Group's business activities and factors likely to affect its future development and performance are disclosed in the Strategic report and Risk Review sections of this report. The financial performance is disclosed within the Financial Review with funding, liquidity and capital details contained within the Risk Performance section.

I would like to thank my predecessor, Crawford Gillies, for his significant contribution over almost seven years on the Committee. I would also like to thank Tim Breedon for his contribution over eight years on the Committee, and to welcome Dawn Fitzpatrick.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration report for 2021, my first as Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThanks too to shareholders for the support shown at our last Annual General Meeting for how we implemented our Directors' remuneration policy (DRP) during 2020, under Crawford's leadership.\n\nAs always, the Committee has taken a number of important considerations into account when making remuneration decisions in respect of 2021 performance. We have looked carefully at Barclays' financial and non-financial performance, in both absolute and relative terms. We have considered delivery of our strategy, as well as risk and conduct. We have also considered the competitive market for hiring and retaining talent. We have weighed the views and expectations of you as shareholders, of our customers and clients, of our colleagues and of our stakeholders in wider society. Our Fair Pay agenda continues to underpin all of our remuneration decisions. That means ensuring that we are recognising the contributions of all our colleagues, junior and senior, supporting and paying all colleagues fairly for the work they do. You can read more in our annual Fair Pay Report, published alongside this Annual Report. We have also published our UK pay gap figures and a narrative explaining them.\n\nAs the Group Chief Executive sets out in his review, we have a robust strategy in place. Our universal banking model and diversified income have provided resilience, despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have delivered a record profit before tax in 2021, enabling us to announce a return of over \u00a32.5bn of capital a to shareholders.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, allow me to set out the key decisions taken this year and our focus for 2022.\n\n## Jes Staley\n\nSince Mr Staley was appointed, in 2015, only 16% of his variable remuneration has vested b . A similar portion has lapsed without vesting. The significant majority, almost 70%, remains unvested, comprising a combination of deferred bonus and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards. Subsequent to the Board changes that were announced in November, in line with its normal procedures, the Committee exercised its discretion to suspend the vesting of all of Mr Staley's unvested awards, pending further developments in respect of the regulatory and legal proceedings related to the ongoing FCA and PRA investigation regarding Mr Staley.\n\nAs outlined in the Nominations Committee Report, the Board agreed with Jes Staley that he would step down from his role as Group Chief Executive and as an Executive Director of Barclays PLC (BPLC) and Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC) with immediate effect on 31 October 2021. The treatment of his remuneration on stepping down was set out in the announcement of those Board changes on 1 November 2021 and is in line with the DRP. He is legally and contractually entitled to 12 months' notice, during which he continues to receive his Fixed Pay, pension allowance and other benefits, and to receive repatriation costs to the US.\n\nNo further remuneration decisions have been made in respect of Mr Staley. The Committee will consider these matters further, in conjunction with the BPLC and BBPLC Boards, as and when it considers appropriate but does not currently expect to make further decisions on this until the conclusion of those regulatory and legal proceedings. Any such decisions in the future will be disclosed in future remuneration reports.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  At the Q4 2021 average share price.\n- a Includes total dividend for 2021 of 6.0p per share and total share buybacks announced in relation to 2021 of \u00a31.5bn.",

        "page_content": "## Performance\n\nOur financial performance during 2021 continued to benefit from the diversification that is inherent in our universal banking model. The Corporate and Investment Bank continued to perform well, with record levels of profitability, offsetting some of the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic and the low interest rate environment.\n\nOur commitment, as ever, is to a remuneration approach that rewards sustainable performance.\n\nBarclays UK and Consumer, Cards and Payments benefited from the ongoing economic recovery, and are well positioned. Cost discipline kept Group base costs a flat, with efficiency savings reinvested to drive income growth.\n\nIn parallel, the Committee continues to work on ensuring that we are rewarding performance that is sustainable. This year marked an important step forward in that effort, with the launch of the Barclays' Mindset. The Mindset acts as an operating manual for how to get things done at Barclays, focusing on three key elements that are core to our success Empower, Challenge and Drive. These in turn help drive 'The Power of One Barclays', our effort to bring our organisation closer together to create synergies and deliver more value for our stakeholders. This way of thinking is embedded in the organisation and initial feedback suggests that it resonates with colleagues as a way of driving long-term success. Over time, we believe it will provide a means of helping us to continue delivering sustainable performance.\n\nWe remain well capitalised, with a CET1 ratio of 15.1%, and have delivered a full year Return on Tangible Equity of 13.4%, meeting our greater-than-10% target. Consequently, we were able to meaningfully increase returns to our shareholders, announcing over \u00a32.5bn of capital returned in respect of 2021, via a total dividend of 6p per share and \u00a31.5bn of announced share buybacks. This is equivalent to a total payout of 15p per share. As the Group Chief Executive sets out in his review, continuing to return capital to shareholders on a consistent basis remains important to Barclays.\n\n## Colleague remuneration\n\nPaying at least a living wage to all our colleagues is at the heart of our Fair Pay agenda. For all our locations, we continue to ensure that we at least meet living wage benchmarks for each country and we have also been cognisant of the inflationary pressures in many jurisdictions. We worked closely with Unite the Union to agree a 2022 UK pay deal for c.43,000 employees with a\n\ntotal salary increase budget of 4.25%, and in addition increased anyone paid below \u00a311 per hour to that amount, or more in London, exceeding the benchmarks set by the Living Wage Foundation. In the US, we made increases to bring lower-paid colleagues at least into alignment with the MIT living wage b , and in India our salary increase budget was over 10% in order to keep pace with local market pressures. Across our business, we targeted the salary spend so there are higher average increases for the most junior colleagues. Due to the pandemic, we accelerated the roll-out of remote access to medical support to colleagues in a number of our key locations during 2021. In India, we provided salary advances and supplemented medical cover to support colleagues through the devastating impact of the Delta variant of COVID-19. Our Fair Pay Report brings together the different ways we think about fair pay at Barclays and provides an update on our progress in putting fairness at the heart of the way we pay our people.\n\nIn particular, the Committee wanted to take into account that all three of our main lines of business - Barclays UK, Consumer, Cards and Payments and the Corporate and Investment Bank - have performed well in 2021, with all three demonstrating robust profitability and delivering double-digit returns on equity.\n\nThis year's incentive pool reflects the consideration of all the elements set out at the start of this statement, including financial and non-financial performance, delivery of our strategy, risk, conduct, expectations of stakeholders and our commitment to fair pay.\n\nThe Committee took into account the strong performance in the Corporate and Investment Bank, where our colleagues continued to make a significant contribution to the global recovery through the economic activity they have facilitated. Record Investment Banking fees and Equities income were achieved c and this has had a material impact on the overall success of the Group.\n\nAt the same time, the Committee recognised the progress made in the delivery of our strategic digital agenda, including the ongoing transformation of Barclays UK, with an acute focus on improving customer and client experiences. Consistent with our approach last year, we were also mindful of the fact that it is often more junior employees who have been on the front line, directly supporting customers and clients during the pandemic. The Committee felt it appropriate to continue to reward those efforts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Determined by Barclays using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Living Wage Calculator, a well-established market-based approach for determining living wages in the US.\n- a Excluding performance costs and structural cost actions.\n- c On a comparable basis, period covering 2014-2021.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n## Annual Statement: Summary of 2021 pay outcomes continued\n\nFinally, we felt it important to recognise the huge effort made across the firm to maintain operational resilience throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, to enable the continued support of our customers and clients, driven in particular by colleagues in Barclays Execution Services (BX).\n\nThis level of incentive funding has enabled us to respond to the extremely competitive global market for talent, as well as the need to ensure our pay remains competitive to help attract and retain the talent required to deliver against our near-term and longer-term objectives. In areas where we had concerns that compensation might be becoming uncompetitive in comparison with our peers, we were able to take steps to address that.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the Committee has approved a Group incentive pool of \u00a31.945bn. This represents an increase that recognises the strong performance across all businesses, following reductions in the incentive pool across many areas of the Group last year.\n\nWe believe that this level of incentive funding is appropriate given what has been delivered and that it is consistent with our philosophy of rewarding sustainable performance, which in turn supports our long-term strategy of delivering continued strong returns to shareholders. In considering the incentive pool, we sought to strike an appropriate balance between a range of complex and at times conflicting factors. We recognise the strong performance that has been achieved, and the need to appropriately reward the teams and individuals responsible for that performance. At the same time, we were cognisant of the importance of maintaining cost discipline and not paying more than is necessary. The importance of reflecting performance is key, and both the Committee and management are clear that if performance falls in future years then the pool will reduce as appropriate.\n\nAs always, a significant portion of the pool is delivered in shares, most of which will be deferred over a number of years, ensuring alignment with shareholders. Those deferrals are subject to malus conditions. For Material Risk Takers, including the Executive Directors, deferrals and the upfront elements of incentive awards are also subject to clawback conditions, which may apply in a broad set of circumstances including individual misbehaviour and/ or material failures of risk management.\n\n## Executive Director remuneration Implementing Fixed Pay increases\n\n## Setting Venkat's remuneration on his appointment as Group Chief Executive\n\nThe DRP that shareholders approved in May 2020 included plans to increase Fixed Pay for Tushar Morzaria and Jes Staley. As reported last year, at the request of the Executive Directors, those increases were postponed in light of the prevailing external environment at that time. As a result of improvements in the economic environment since then, in July 2021 the Committee implemented those delayed increases.\n\nC.S. Venkatakrishnan (known as Venkat) was appointed Group Chief Executive with effect from 1 November 2021. The remuneration arrangements that the Committee agreed on his appointment reflect his role and responsibilities and are in accordance with the DRP.\n\nVenkat's Fixed Pay was set at \u00a32.7m, delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares. Fixed Pay shares are delivered quarterly, subject to a holding period with restrictions lifting over five years. This level of Fixed Pay was a reduction from that for his previous role as Head of Global Markets and Co-President of Barclays Bank PLC. Venkat also receives cash payments in lieu of pension in line with the DRP, equal to 5% of his Fixed Pay (equivalent to 10% of Fixed cash), which totalled \u00a3135,000 per annum on appointment. He receives standard benefits, including medical cover and life assurance,  and is eligible to receive relocation support in line with our standard approach, including temporary accommodation in London, in accordance with the DRP. On an annual basis, Venkat is eligible to be considered for a discretionary incentive award and LTIP award in line with the DRP, up to a maximum value of 93% of Fixed Pay for bonus and up to 140% of Fixed Pay for the LTIP.\n\n## Determining Executive Director pay outcomes\n\nFor 2021, Venkat was awarded a pro-rata discretionary incentive award for his part-year performance as Group Chief Executive, following his appointment. Although Venkat has started his new role as Group Chief Executive well, with real purpose, we did not consider it realistic to set strategic personal objectives and assess performance against those objectives after only two months in post. As a result, this bonus decision was based on the financial and non-financial measures only, scaling up the weighting of each to cover the entire bonus opportunity without any element based on personal objectives. Venkat received a separate discretionary incentive award in respect of the portion of 2021 when he was Head of Markets and Co-President of Barclays Bank PLC, which is not included within this report as it does not relate to his time as an Executive Director. For Tushar, his annual bonus was assessed against the financial, strategic and personal measures that were set out in the 2020 Remuneration report.\n\nIn the context of the Group's strong performance in 2021, the Committee considered the Executive Directors' bonus and LTIP outcomes.\n\nOn the financial bonus measures, profit before tax significantly exceeded the level required to trigger a 100% outcome for that element of the bonus. Profit before tax for 2021 reached record levels, and was higher than the top of the profit before tax target range for all previous bonus cycles. This, combined with a cost: income ratio also ahead of the maximum target and with good performance against the strategic non-financial measures, resulted in a 2021 bonus outcome equal to 94.4% of maximum for Venkat, and 94.5% of maximum for Tushar after factoring in his performance against his personal objectives. The outcome for the 2019-2021 LTIP was lower, at 55%, impacted by the performance challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during 2020.",

        "page_content": "The Committee reflected on the appropriateness of these outcomes, for both the 2021 bonus and 2019-2021 LTIP.  We reviewed the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong and well-capitalised. We considered the bonus outcomes in the context of the bonus outcomes for the wider workforce, ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a multi-year period, and also compared to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year. We concluded that the outcomes are appropriate in the context of the performance achieved and that no discretionary adjustment was warranted.\n\nThe Committee decided to grant awards under the 2022-2024 LTIP cycle with a face value at grant of 140% of Fixed Pay for Venkat and 134% of Fixed Pay for Tushar, reflecting strong 2021 performance.\n\nNo changes were made to any in-flight LTIP awards and the performance measures and targets for those awards have not been altered.\n\n## The Executive Directors' pay in 2022\n\nAn annual review of Fixed Pay for the Executive Directors, in the same way and at the same time as for the wider workforce, was introduced as a feature of the DRP in 2020 but had not been operated to date due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, the Committee reviewed the level of Fixed Pay for Venkat and Tushar in line with that approach and we will do this annually in the future. The maximum total compensation opportunity for both Venkat and Tushar is driven by their level of Fixed Pay, and for both of them is materially behind market when compared to the equivalent opportunity for comparable roles at our international banking peers. Given this relative market positioning, the Committee agreed to increase Fixed Pay by 3% for Venkat and 3% for Tushar, resulting in Fixed Pay of \u00a32,780,000 and \u00a31,775,000 respectively from 1 March 2022. This percentage increase is lower than the average increase across the wider workforce, including the 4.25% 2022 UK pay deal agreed with Unite. Even after these Fixed Pay increases, the total compensation opportunity that results for each Executive Director remains well behind our international banking peers.\n\nThe Committee carefully considered the performance measures for the 2022 bonus and the 2022-2024 LTIP. The bonus measures for 2022 are in line with those for 2021, with one key amendment. For 2022, we have increased the weighting of the Strategic non-financial element from 20% to 25%, with a corresponding reduction to the weighting of the Personal objectives from 20% to 15%, to enable a greater focus on climate-related measures. Within the Strategic non-financial element, the Customers and clients and Colleagues sections are retained, and are each weighted at 7.5%, with a new Climate and sustainability section in place of the Society section, weighted at 10%. This section now primarily focuses on climaterelated measures, including progress towards our green financing commitments and reducing our own carbon footprint, as well as delivering the strategy to achieve our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. This reflects the focus and importance that we attach to the Group's delivery on its climate objectives. The other bonus measures remain substantially unchanged.\n\n## Shareholder alignment\n\nFor the 2022-2024 LTIP, changes have been made to align more closely with the evolution of the bonus measures. The strategic non-financial element of this LTIP cycle will include a Climate and sustainability category, in place of the standalone Climate measure, with a weighting of 10%. The other measures are largely unchanged.\n\nTotal variable pay (annual bonus and LTIP) for the Executive Directors will be delivered primarily in shares that must be retained for a period of between one and eight years from award, aligning the Executive Directors' interests more closely to the shareholder experience. Venkat already has a significant shareholding and will continue building this over the coming years towards the level stipulated under the personal shareholding requirements, while Tushar continues to hold substantial shareholdings over and above the required level.\n\n## Group Finance Director succession\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs indicated in the letters from the Chairman and Group Chief Executive introducing this Annual Report, on 22 February 2022 Tushar Morzaria informed the Board of his intention to retire from the Board and as Group Finance Director, and the Board has agreed that this will take effect on 22 April 2022. The remuneration details in connection with his retirement and for his successor, Anna Cross, will be set out in a separate announcement to the market on 23 February 2022, and are not reflected in this Remuneration report.\n\nOur current DRP, approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM for a period of three years, is nearing its end. As we move into 2022, the Committee will be reviewing our DRP and considering how it should evolve. We will also discuss this with stakeholders, including our largest institutional shareholders, to understand their perspectives.\n\nBeyond this, the Committee will continue its focus on rewarding sustainable performance. We are pleased with Barclays' performance this year and the progress made over recent years to transform the bank. We remain committed to making sure that the way we pay our people continues to support the long-term health and success of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Brian Gilvary\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nChair, Board Remuneration Committee",

It is closely aligned with Provision 40 of the FRC's UK Corporate Governance Code, as shown in the table that follows, and we have continued to be transparent on the resulting outcomes in this report.\n\nOur remuneration philosophy applies to all of our employees globally, including our Executive Directors. The pay decisions set out in this report are a result of the application of our remuneration philosophy during 2021.\n\nWe consider the views of all of our stakeholders in remuneration decisionmaking. In 2021, we achieved this by meeting with institutional shareholders to understand their views on our 2020 pay outcomes, engaging extensively with our regulators to ensure appropriate compliance with new regulatory requirements, and continuing our partnership with Unite the Union in the UK to understand the views of their members and agree a new pay deal. We used our 2020 Fair Pay Report and internal communication channels to share information on our approach to pay with\n\ncolleagues, including how executive remuneration aligns with the wider company pay policy, and are now publishing our fourth Fair Pay Report to help do the same for 2021.\n\nSpecifically relating to our Executive Directors, we review the performance measures for the forward-looking incentives each year to ensure that we maintain alignment with our strategic priorities and KPIs, and to ensure that the measures we select continue to be appropriate in light of current circumstances and challenges. Alongside our key financial measures, our strategic non-financial performance objectives will ensure that the link between individual incentive outcomes and the delivery of our strategy, and the achievement of sustainable long-term performance, continues to be reinforced. The alignment of executive pay to our culture is further enhanced by the inclusion of the responsibility to embed our Mindset across the organisation and continue to develop a high-performing culture in line with our Values in the personal objectives for our Group Chief Executive.",

No LTIP award was granted to C.S. Venkatakrishnan in 2019 as he was not an Executive Director at that time.\n- a C. S. Venkatakrishnan was appointed as Group Chief Executive on 1 November 2021. The remuneration included in the table above for 2021 is in respect of his services as an Executive Director during 2021.\n- c The LTIP amount for 2021 relates to awards granted in 2019, with vesting based on performance measured over 2019 to 2021. The value shown includes a 56% share price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date of the first tranche, estimated based on the Q4 2021 average share price of \u00a31.91, as the 2021 Annual Report was finalised prior to the vesting date.\n- e  The LTIP amounts for 2020 relate to awards granted in 2018, with vesting based on performance measured over 2018 to 2020. The values shown include a 1% share price depreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date, based on the share price on the vesting date of the first tranche, which was \u00a31.75. The 2020 LTIP values disclosed in the 2020 Remuneration report were estimates, based on the Q4 2020 average share price, as the 2020 Annual Report was finalised prior to the vesting date.\n- d  Fixed Pay for 2020 is shown before contributions made by Tushar Morzaria and Jes Staley to COVID-19 charitable causes, equal to one-third of Fixed Pay for six months.\n- f Jes Staley stepped down as Group Chief Executive and an Executive Director on 31 October 2021. The remuneration included in the table above for 2021 is in respect of his services as an Executive Director during 2021.\n- g  The Committee has made no decisions in respect of Mr Staley's remuneration for his performance during 2021, and has suspended the vesting of all of Mr Staley's unvested deferred remuneration awards, including the LTIP award granted to him in March 2019 that normally would have been shown in the table above, as explained earlier in this Remuneration report.\n\n## Additional information in respect of each element of pay for the Executive Directors (audited)\n\nFixed Pay is delivered 50% in cash, paid monthly, and 50% in shares, delivered quarterly. The shares are subject to a holding period, with restrictions lifting over five years, 20% each year.\n\n## 1) Fixed Pay\n\nDuring 2020, in response to the pandemic, Tushar Morzaria and Jes Staley asked to postpone increases to their Fixed Pay that shareholders had approved at the 2020 AGM as part of the new DRP. The economic environment improved in 2021 and the postponed Fixed Pay increases were implemented with effect from 1 July 2021. Fixed Pay for Tushar Morzaria increased from \u00a31,650,000 to \u00a31,725,000 and for Jes Staley increased from \u00a32,350,000 to \u00a32,400,000. On appointment as Group Chief Executive, Fixed Pay for C.S. Venkatakrishnan was set at \u00a32,700,000, to deliver an appropriate starting total compensation opportunity, in line with the DRP. This is lower than his Fixed Pay in his previous role, as Head of Global Markets and Co-President of Barclays Bank PLC. More information on Fixed Pay is set out on page 186.\n\nExecutive Directors are paid cash in lieu of pension contributions equal to 5% of their Fixed Pay (equivalent to 10% of fixed cash). The pension cash allowance paid during 2021 was \u00a322,500 for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and \u00a398,750 for Jes Staley, for the respective periods they each served as Group Chief Executive during the year, and \u00a384,375 for Tushar Morzaria. No other benefits were received by Executive Directors from any Barclays' pension plan.\n\n## 2) Pension\n\n## 3) Taxable benefits\n\n## 4) 2021 annual bonus\n\nTaxable benefits include private medical cover, life assurance, income protection, tax advice, car allowance and the use of a Company vehicle and driver when required for business purposes. For C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the benefits figure also includes the cost to the Company during 2021 of providing him with temporary accommodation in London, following his appointment as Group Chief Executive, which was c.\u00a35,500. Under the terms of his relocation to London, temporary accommodation in London will be provided to him for a period of up to two years following his appointment, the annualised cost of which including tax gross up is expected to be c.\u00a3190,000.\n\nThe bonus amount included in the single total figure is the value awarded or scheduled to be awarded in Q1 following the financial year to which it relates.\n\nIn determining the bonus in respect of 2021 performance, the Committee considered the performance achieved against the Financial and Strategic non-financial performance measures that had been set to reflect Company priorities for 2021. A summary of the assessment of performance and resulting annual bonus outcomes for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Tushar Morzaria is provided in the table that follows.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration report\n\n## Annual report on Directors' remuneration continued\n\nFor C.S. Venkatakrishnan, while he is considered to have performed well in his first two months as Group Chief Executive, the Committee determined that it was not realistic to set strategic personal objectives for those two months. As a result, his bonus in respect of that period was determined by increasing the weightings of the Financial and Strategic non-financial performance measures to cover the entire bonus opportunity, resulting in weightings of 75% and 25% respectively, while pro-rating the bonus opportunity for the proportion of 2021 that he served as Group Chief Executive. In 2022, the standard weighting to Personal objectives will apply.\n\nFor Jes Staley, the Committee has not made any remuneration decisions at this stage and will consider these matters further as and when it considers appropriate but does not currently expect to make further decisions on this until the conclusion of the regulatory and legal proceedings related to the ongoing FCA and PRA investigation regarding Mr Staley.\n\nFor Tushar Morzaria, performance against the Personal objectives set for him, and the shared Personal objectives set for him and Jes Staley, was assessed in the normal way. Financial measures were weighted at 60%, Strategic non-financial weighted at 20% and Personal objectives weighted at 20%.\n\n## 2021 annual bonus outcomes\n\n|                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                               | C.S.

|\n\n## Notes\n\n- a \u00a3648m of structural cost actions treated as material items and excluded from 2021 profit before tax and cost: income ratio. Structural cost actions primarily relate to the real estate review in Q221 and Barclays UK transformation costs.\n\nBased on the Financial and Strategic non-financial assessment outlined above, for C.S. Venkatakrishnan the Committee determined an overall formulaic bonus outcome of 94.4% of the maximum opportunity. This equates to \u00a3395,000, after pro-rating the bonus opportunity for the proportion of 2021 that he served as Group Chief Executive and an Executive Director, of which 83% will be deferred under the Share Value Plan. For Tushar Morzaria, the Committee also recognised his outstanding performance against his individual and shared Personal objectives during 2021, assessing that an outcome of 19% out of a maximum of 20% was appropriate in that respect, which resulted in an overall formulaic outcome for Tushar of 94.5%. This equates to \u00a31,467,000, of which 73% will be deferred under the Share Value Plan.\n\nIn line with the DRP, and due to the regulations prohibiting dividend equivalents being paid on unvested deferred share awards, the number of shares awarded to each Executive Director under the Share Value Plan will be calculated using a share price at the date of award, discounted to reflect the absence of dividend equivalents during the vesting period. The valuation will be aligned to IFRS 2, with the market expectations of dividends during the deferral period being assessed by an independent adviser. The shares will vest in tranches over years one to seven (subject to the rules of the Share Value Plan as amended from time to time) such that vesting, in combination with the LTIP, is no faster than pro-rata. As a result, all of the shares for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and the majority of shares for Tushar Morzaria in respect of the 2021 performance year will vest in two equal tranches on the first and second anniversary of grant. All shares (whether deferred or not) are subject to a further one-year holding period from the point of release. 2021 bonuses are subject to clawback provisions and the deferred elements of 2021 bonuses are subject to malus provisions, which enable the Committee to delay or reduce the vesting of unvested deferred bonuses (including to nil).\n\nThe Committee reflected on the appropriateness of these outcomes for the 2021 bonus, in the context of the performance achieved against the Financial measures, Strategic non-financial measures and, where applicable, Personal objectives. The Committee considered the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong and well-capitalised. The outcomes for the Financial measures adjust for structural cost actions, which include costs in support of the BUK transformation. The Committee satisfied itself that the portion of these costs relating to colleague redundancies was appropriate to be excluded, as this part of the transformation is in response to changing customer behaviours and the broader evolution of the UK retail banking environment and not a result of the COVID-19 pandemic (and similarly for the Financial measures for the 2019-2021 LTIP). Consideration was also given to the strong start that C.S. Venkatakrishnan made during 2021 as he commenced his new role as Group Chief Executive, and the performance of Tushar Morzaria during 2021 against the Personal objectives set at the beginning of the year. The bonus outcomes were considered in the context of the bonus outcomes for the wider workforce, ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a multi-year period, and also by comparing to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance year on year. The Committee believes that the overall 2021 bonus outcomes above are aligned appropriately with stakeholder considerations and with the performance achieved. Based on this, the Committee concluded that no discretionary adjustment was warranted.\n\nFurther detail follows on the assessment of the Strategic non-financial measures, and performance against Personal objectives where applicable.",

        "page_content": "## Assessment of the Strategic non-financial measures for the 2021 annual bonus\n\nOn this basis, the Committee agreed an overall outcome for the Strategic non-financial measures of 15.5% out of a maximum of 20%, which is the outcome reflected in the table above for Tushar Morzaria. The equivalent outcome for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, after scaling up the weighting of the Strategic non-financial measures from 20% to 25%, is 19.4% out of 25%. The detail supporting this assessment is provided in the table that follows.\n\nProgress in relation to each of the Strategic non-financial measures, organised around three equally weighted categories, was assessed by the Committee. Within each of the three categories, the overall outcome was assessed based on the following scale: 0% to 1% Behind track on most measures, 1.5% to 3% Slightly behind track on most measures, 3.5% to 5.5% On track or slightly ahead of track on most measures, and 6% or 7% Ahead of track on most measures.\n\nThe measures used in the Strategic non-financial assessment for bonus reflect key strategic priorities of the Bank. Most outcomes are either measured by an external provider (such as NPS or Investment Banking and Global Markets rank and fee share data) or are subject to independent 'limited assurance', including all Society measures with the exception of the Unreasonable Impact measure (which is delivered in partnership with the Unreasonable Group).\n\n| Measure                                    | Criteria                                                       | Performance                                                                                                             | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Outcome                |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Investment  Banking fee  ranking and share |                                                                | 6th (up from 7th in 2020) Fee share increased to 3.7% (up  from 3.6% in 2020)                                           | \u25a0 Improved position from 7th to 6th with a small  improvement in global fee share \u25a0 Improved performance in both of key focus areas of M&A  and ECM.

The value that will vest has been estimated using the Q4 2021 average share price of \u00a31.9144. Release is dependent on, among other things, performance over the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2021, with straight-line vesting applied between the threshold and maximum points for the financial measures.\n\nNo LTIP award was granted to C.S. Venkatakrishnan in 2019 as he was not an Executive Director at that time. For Jes Staley, the Committee exercised its discretion to suspend the vesting of all of his unvested awards, including the LTIP award granted in 2019, as explained earlier in this Remuneration report. No decision has been taken as to any potential vesting of this award for Mr Staley.",

The Committee was satisfied that this underpin was met, and accordingly determined that the award held by Tushar Morzaria should vest at 55% of the maximum number of shares under the total award, to be released in five equal tranches annually, starting from March 2022. After release, the shares are subject to an additional 12-month holding period.\n\nAn award was granted to each of Tushar Morzaria and Jes Staley on 8th March 2021 under the 2021-2023 LTIP, based on a value per share of \u00a31.43938, which was derived from the share price less a discount to reflect the absence of dividends or equivalents during the vesting period, in accordance with the DRP. This is the value used to calculate the number of shares below.\n\n## LTIP awards granted during 2021\n\nFor Jes Staley, the Committee exercised its discretion to suspend the vesting of all of his unvested awards, including the LTIP award granted on 8 March 2021, as explained earlier in this Remuneration report.

Venkatakrishnan in March 2021 as he was not an Executive Director at that time.\n\n|                 | % of Fixed Pay   | Number of shares   | Face value at grant   | Performance period   |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| Tushar Morzaria | 134%             | 1,536,078          | \u00a32,211,000            | 2021-2023            |\n| Jes Staley      | 140%             | 2,285,706          | \u00a33,290,000            | 2021-2023            |",

The following chart illustrates how 2022 remuneration will be delivered to the Executive Directors.\n\n## Statement of implementation of remuneration policy in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 Fixed Pay and market competitiveness of the Executive Directors' total compensation opportunity\n\nThe Committee determined the level of Fixed Pay for C.S. Venkatakrishnan on appointment as Group Chief Executive as \u00a32,700,000 per annum. In doing so, they concluded that the total compensation opportunity that this provides was an appropriate starting point, while noting that it was low compared with international banking peers and that this should be kept under review each year. This level of Fixed Pay was lower than he received for his previous role, as Head of Global Markets and Co-President of Barclays Bank PLC, though it was more than his predecessor as Group Chief Executive received.\n\nImmediately prior to C.S. Venkatakrishnan's appointment as Group Chief Executive, effective from 1 November 2021, the Committee considered the level of Fixed Pay he should receive, taking into consideration the role, his skills and experience and pay levels at other comparable firms (on which the Committee receives independent advice), in the context of wider workforce pay levels and the experience of our stakeholders. Pay benchmarking data is used as a reference point to ensure that the total compensation opportunity provided to the Executive Directors is competitive compared to other large and complex international banks. Banking regulation in the UK and Europe caps variable pay as a percentage of Fixed Pay for senior roles including the Executive Directors and so providing a competitive level of total compensation within the constraint of those regulations is a key driver of the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay levels.\n\nThe regulatory limit on the level of variable pay relative to fixed pay in banks results in the need to provide both Executive Directors with a level of Fixed Pay that is higher than the Committee might otherwise choose, to ensure the total compensation opportunity is competitive. To mitigate some of the impacts of that higher Fixed Pay, it is delivered half in cash, paid monthly via payroll in a similar way to salary for other employees, and half in shares, which are granted quarterly and released in instalments over 5 years, creating significant alignment with shareholder interests over the longer term.\n\nAn annual review of the Executive Directors' Fixed Pay, in the same way and at the same time as for the wider workforce, is a feature of the DRP approved by shareholders in 2020, but was not undertaken in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2022, the Committee reviewed the Fixed Pay for each Executive Director as part of the year-end pay review process for colleagues across the Group. The Committee considered the maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director, driven by their respective levels of Fixed Pay, and noted that in each case the opportunity is materially less than that at most other comparable international banks. As a result, the Committee determined that Fixed Pay would be increased to \u00a32,780,000 for C.S. Venkatakrishnan, a 3% increase, and to \u00a31,775,000 for Tushar Morzaria, also a 3% increase, effective 1 March 2022. The Committee noted that these are lower percentage increases than the average fixed pay increase for the wider workforce, and in particular for other UK colleagues, given the 4.25% salary spend agreed as part of the 2022 UK pay deal with Unite.",

Combining that with the 2022 pay review increase, the total Fixed Pay increase he has received since 2019 is 7.6%. Across our Unite-recognised colleagues in the UK, the compound average salary increase over the same period was 9.1%. For C.S. Venkatakrishnan, the Committee also considered whether a Fixed Pay increase in March 2022, following the determination of his current level of Fixed Pay on his appointment as Group Chief Executive, was appropriate, and confirmed that this is not out of line with the treatment of other colleagues who were promoted during the year, if their pay rates are below the benchmark.\n\nThe charts also show a comparison of the maximum total compensation opportunity of each Executive Director with the equivalent roles at the companies that make up the FTSE 30 (i.e. the 30 largest FTSE 100 constituents by market capitalisation). This shows that the Executive Directors' maximum total compensation opportunity is more competitive, but not inappropriate, compared to the FTSE 30 group. The Committee noted that it would be unlikely for the Group to fill either of the Executive Director roles by recruiting from the other FTSE 30 companies, recognising the necessity for candidates for these roles to have the right breadth and depth of banking knowledge and experience, particularly given Barclays' diversified business model including significant corporate banking, investment banking and global markets businesses. However, this comparison is provided alongside the international banking peer group to provide additional UK context.\n\nThe charts that follow compare each Executive Director's maximum total compensation opportunity for 2022 against the equivalent opportunity across international banking peers. This shows that even after these Fixed Pay increases the maximum total compensation opportunity is significantly behind international banking peers, falling in the lower part of the third quartile for both C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Tushar Morzaria.\n\n## Executive Director total maximum compensation opportunity relative to market benchmarks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- \u25a0 Benchmark data for the international banking peer group and FTSE 30 was provided by Willis Towers Watson, based on publicly disclosed data in respect of each firm's 2020 or 2020/21 financial years, incorporating assumptions where companies do not disclose a maximum total compensation opportunity\n- \u25a0 Barclays and market benchmark data reflects maximum total compensation opportunity, excluding pensions and benefits\n- \u25a0 Barclays' current peer group comprises the following international banks: Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank, HSBC Holdings, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and UBS Group, which is unchanged from the group set out in the DRP\n\n## 2022 annual bonus performance measures\n\nPerformance measures with appropriately stretching targets have been selected to cover a range of financial and non-financial goals that support the key strategic objectives of the Company. The bonus measures for 2022 are in line with those for 2021, with one key amendment. For 2022, the weighting of the Strategic non-financial element has been increased from 20% to 25%, with a corresponding reduction to the weighting of the Personal objectives from 20% to 15%, to enable a greater focus on climate-related measures. Within the Strategic non-financial element, the Customers and clients and Colleagues sections are retained, and are each weighted at 7.5%, with a new Climate and sustainability section in place of the Society section, weighted at 10%. This section primarily focuses on climate-related measures, including progress towards our green financing commitments and reducing our own carbon footprint, as well as delivering the strategy to achieve our ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050. This change in bonus measures reflects the focus and importance attached to the Group's delivery on its climate objectives. For the Group Chief Executive, although for 2021 the bonus was determined solely based on the Financial and Strategic non-financial elements, for 2022 assessment against Personal objectives will also apply, in the usual way.",

The strategic non-financial element of this LTIP cycle will include a 'Climate and sustainability' category, in place of the standalone Climate measure, with a weighting of 10%. The other measures are largely unchanged.\n\nThe Committee decided to grant awards under the 2022-2024 LTIP cycle to C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Tushar Morzaria with face values at grant equal to 140% and 134% of Fixed Pay respectively, which will be based on Fixed Pay before applying the 1 March 2022 increases outlined earlier in this Remuneration report. Those maximum award multiples were determined following a detailed review of their individual performance throughout 2021 and recognising their significant personal contributions. This share-based award ensures alignment with future performance over the three-year assessment period, as well as shareholder alignment over the long release period (up to eight years from initial award).\n\nThe 2022-2024 LTIP award will be subject to the following forward-looking performance measures.\n\n| Performance measure                                                     | Weighting   |

It is also subject to deferral, additional holding periods, malus and clawback. In line with reporting requirements, we have provided an indication of the maximum remuneration receivable, assuming share price appreciation of 50% on the LTIP.\n\nThe charts below show the potential value of the current Executive Directors' 2022 total remuneration in three main scenarios: 'Minimum' (i.e. Fixed Pay, pension and benefits only, with no annual bonus award or LTIP), 'Mid-point' (i.e. Fixed Pay, pension, benefits and 50% of the maximum variable pay that may be awarded) and 'Maximum' (i.e. Fixed Pay, pension, benefits and the maximum variable pay that may be awarded). For the purposes of these charts, the value of benefits is based on an estimated annual value for 2022 regular contractual benefits. Additional ad hoc benefits may arise, for example, overseas relocation of Executive Directors, but will always be provided in line with the DRP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual bonus\n\n## Note\n\n- a.   Pension and benefits include the value of cash in lieu of pension and the anticipated value of taxable benefits. For C.S. Venkatakrishnan this does not include relocation costs to which he is contractually entitled but which might not be incurred during 2022. The relocation costs include temporary accommodation in London, the annualised cost of which including tax gross up is expected to be c.\u00a3190,000.\n\n## Group Finance Director succession\n\nAs indicated in the letters from the Chairman and Group Chief Executive introducing this Annual Report, on 22 February 2022 Tushar Morzaria informed the Board of his intention to retire from the Board and as Group Finance Director, and the Board has agreed that this will take effect on 22 April 2022. The remuneration details in connection with his retirement and for his successor, Anna Cross, will be set out in a separate announcement to the market on 23 February 2022, and are not reflected in this Remuneration report.\n\nGroup Finance Director\n\n\u00a3m\n\nMinimum\n\n93%\n\nMid-point\n\n46%\n\n30%\n\nMaximum\n\n30%\n\n40%\n\nTotal 1.92\n\n7%\n\n4%\n\n20%\n\n3%\n\n27%\n\nMaximum with share price increase\n\n25%\n\n34%\n\n2%\n\n22%\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nTotal 3.90\n\nTotal 5.89\n\nTotal 7.08\n\n17%",

Venkatakrishnan and Jes Staley (as per the single total figure for remuneration table) in respect of their periods of service as Group Chief Executive in 2021.\n\nThe regulations provide three options which may be used to calculate total pay for the employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile. Following guidance issued by some proxy advisers and institutional shareholders, we have selected Option A to calculate total pay for each calendar year, each year using the employee population on 31 December.\n\nTotal pay and fixed pay for the employees at the 25th percentile, median and 75th percentile are set out in the table below.\n\nOption A calculates total pay for all employees on the same basis that the single total figure for remuneration is calculated for Executive Directors. Total pay for each employee includes earned fixed pay, which is made up of salary, Role Based Pay and relevant allowances, annual incentives awarded for the 2021 calendar year, and an estimate of pension and benefits for 2021. Other elements of pay such as overtime and shift allowances have been excluded. The estimate of pension for each employee is based on the percentage currently available to new hires in the UK (10% of salary for the more senior and 12% for the more junior corporate grades). The estimate of benefits is based on the cost of core benefits available at each corporate grade, including private medical insurance, income protection and life assurance. Calculations use full-time equivalent pay data taken from our HR systems for all UK employees.\n\n|      | 25th percentile   | 25th percentile   | Median    | Median    | 75th percentile   | 75th percentile   |\n|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|      | Total pay         | Fixed Pay         | Total pay | Fixed Pay | Total pay         | Fixed Pay         |\n| 2021 | \u00a331,404           | \u00a326,035           | \u00a348,253   | \u00a339,461   | \u00a385,407           | \u00a367,408           |\n| 2020 | \u00a329,380           | \u00a324,706           | \u00a344,631   | \u00a337,460   | \u00a379,324           | \u00a364,272           |\n| 2019 | \u00a327,875           | \u00a323,348           | \u00a342,362   | \u00a335,158   | \u00a377,488           | \u00a362,263           |\n| 2018 | \u00a326,587           | \u00a321,899           | \u00a339,390   | \u00a332,202   | \u00a374,685           | \u00a360,000           |\n\nThe Group Chief Executive pay ratios have decreased between 2020 and 2021, largely due to a decrease in the Group Chief Executive remuneration, which is calculated using the sum of 2021 remuneration for C.S. Venkatakrishnan and Jes Staley for their respective periods of service as Group Chief Executive in the year, as per the single total figure for 2021 remuneration table. Over the same time period, employee total pay increased by 7% at the lower quartile and by 8% at each of the median and upper quartile, also contributing to the decrease in pay ratios. The increases in median fixed pay and bonus between 2020 and 2021 are explained in more detail in the section that follows, which covers the annual percentage change in remuneration of Directors and employees.\n\nBarclays remuneration philosophy is set out earlier in this report, and all remuneration decisions for Executive Directors and the wider workforce are made within this framework. The Group Chief Executive pay ratio is one of the outcomes of all of these decisions, which are explained in more detail in the Committee Chair's annual statement.\n\nThe decrease in the Group Chief Executive single total figure for remuneration from 2020 to 2021 is due to two factors. Firstly, C.S. Venkatakrishan's remuneration for his two months of service as Group Chief Executive during 2021 does not include any value in respect of LTIP, as no 2019-2021 LTIP award was granted to him given that he was not an Executive Director at the time of grant. Secondly, Jes Staley's 2021 single total figure for the 10 months of 2021 that he served as Group Chief Executive does not include any bonus or LTIP value, as no remuneration decisions have been made in respect of Mr Staley, and his unvested LTIP and deferred bonus awards have been suspended, as explained earlier in this Remuneration report.",

The Committee has not made any remuneration decisions at this stage, as explained earlier in this Remuneration report.\n- a C.S. Venkatakrishnan was appointed as Group Chief Executive on 1 November 2021. No percentage change figures can be calculated for 2020/21 as C.S. Venkatakrishnan did not receive any remuneration in respect of services provided as an Executive Director in 2020.\n- c The BPLC comparison is included because this is a statutory requirement, though BPLC employs only a very small number of Head Office employees (45 for 2021).\n\nFor the Executive Directors, percentage change figures for 2020 to 2021 are calculated using the single total figure for the 2021 remuneration table.\n\nFor bonus, in many parts of the Group bonuses were down in 2020 but the Committee chose to protect outcomes for junior colleagues, consistent with our Fair Pay agenda, and as a result the greatest reductions in incentives from 2019 to 2020 were seen for more senior colleagues. The incentive approach for the Executive Directors is significantly more structured than for most other employees, as required by institutional shareholders for Directors of UK-listed companies, and this more structured approach leads to greater year-on-year volatility in incentive outcomes, both up and down, for the Executive Directors compared to the norms for other colleagues. This can be seen in the much larger than average year-on-year reduction in bonus for Jes Staley and Tushar Morzaria from 2019 to 2020.\n\nFor Fixed Pay, the increases from 2020 to 2021 for Jes Staley and Tushar Morzaria reflect the increases approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM, which were postponed at the request of the Executive Directors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and only implemented with effect from 1 July 2021 as economic conditions improved. Their reductions in benefits over the same time period are largely due to reductions in tax compliance costs.\n\nMoving from 2020 into 2021, the Group's performance was significantly stronger, with record profit before tax in 2021 and all three main lines of business delivering double-digit returns on equity. The significant increase in Tushar Morzaria's bonus reflects that stronger financial performance, which resulted in a maximum pay-out against the financial elements of the Executive Directors' 2021 bonus measures, alongside an outstanding personal performance in 2021 and outcomes for the Strategic non-financial measures that were strong, comparable with 2020. Tushar Morzaria's bonus paid out at 94.5% of maximum in 2021 and 38.6% of maximum in 2020.\n\nFor the UK employees, the 5% increase in median fixed pay reflects increases awarded during 2021 in the normal course of business, and also a change in the make-up of the UK population. In 2021, as part of the broader BUK transformation, the profile of a number of customer facing roles changed. To support the new business model, over 2,000 branch colleagues developed new skills and were promoted to recognise their broader, more-complex customer support responsibilities. Their previous lower-graded roles were not replaced. This promotion of employees into more highly-skilled and more highly-paid roles also contributed to the upward shift in median fixed pay. The increase in median bonus for UK employees is driven in part by the same demographic shift in the population, but mainly as a result of the increase in bonus pool from 2020 to 2021, reflecting improved organisational performance.\n\nIn determining the 2021 bonus outcomes for the Executive Directors, the Committee considered the context of the bonus outcomes for the wider workforce, ensuring appropriate alignment both this year and over a multi-year period, and also compared to historical outcomes for the Executive Directors in the context of performance each year. They also reviewed the underlying financial health of the Group, which is strong and well-capitalised. They concluded that the outcomes were appropriate in the context of the performance achieved.\n\nBPLC only employs a very small number of Head Office employees (45 for 2021) and there is frequent movement of employees between BPLC and other entities within the Barclays Group. In order to make a meaningful year-on-year comparison, the figures are therefore based on all individuals employed by BPLC in both years (39 individuals). The fixed pay increase for this population of 11%, which is higher than that for the median UK employee Group-wide, is driven by a few market adjustments in this small population. The bonus increase is broadly in line with the increase for the median employee across the UK workforce and is largely due to the year-on-year increase in bonus pool reflecting business performance.",

Venkatakrishnan and Tushar Morzaria, or as at 31 October 2021 for Jes Staley, being his last day of active service, in each case using the Q4 2021 average Barclays' ordinary share price of \u00a31.9144.\n\nFor Jes Staley, the shareholding requirement is 233% of his Fixed Pay on his last day of active service as an Executive Director and the requirement continues to apply for two years following his last day of active service. As he has stepped down as an Executive Director, in addition to the shares that he beneficially owns counting towards the requirement, shares from unvested deferred share bonuses and unvested LTIPs (net of tax) can also be counted, provided that there are no remaining untested performance conditions. The chart below includes only the beneficially owned shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Service contracts and letters of appointment\n\nAs stated in the letters of appointment, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial term of three years and are subject to annual re-election by shareholders. On expiry of the initial term and subject to the needs of the Board, Non-Executive Directors may be invited to serve a further three years. Non-Executive Directors appointed beyond six years will be at the discretion of the Board Nominations Committee.\n\nEach Executive Director has a service contract, whereas the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors each have a letter of appointment. Copies of the service contracts and letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company's registered office. The effective dates of the current Directors' appointments disclosed in their service contracts or letters of appointment are shown in the table below.\n\n|                         | Effective date of appointment              |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Chairman                |                                            |\n| Nigel Higgins           | 1 March 2019 (as a Non-Executive Director) |\n|                         | 2 May 2019 (as Chairman)                   |\n| Executive Directors     |                                            |\n| C.S.

During his notice period, he continues to receive his Fixed Pay (\u00a32.4m per annum delivered half in cash, paid monthly, and half in Barclays shares, awarded each quarter), pension allowance (\u00a3120,000 per annum, paid monthly) and other benefits, in line with the DRP. The amounts that he received during 2021, after stepping down, amounted to Fixed Pay in cash of \u00a3200,000, Fixed Pay in shares of \u00a3200,000, pension allowance of \u00a320,000 and other benefits with a value of approximately \u00a36,000. He is also contractually entitled to receive repatriation costs to the US, in line with the DRP, though these have not yet been incurred. No decisions have yet been made in respect of any further remuneration payments to be made to Mr Staley, as outlined in the annual statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Former Group Chief Executive: Jes Staley\n\n## Former Group Finance Director: Chris Lucas\n\n## Former Chairs or Non-Executive Directors\n\nIn 2021, Chris Lucas continued to be eligible to receive life assurance cover, private medical cover and payments under the Executive Income Protection Plan (EIPP). Full details of his eligibility under the EIPP were disclosed in the 2013 Remuneration report (page 115 of the 2013 Annual Report). Chris Lucas did not receive any other payment or benefit in 2021.\n\nNo payments were made to former Chairs or Non-Executive Directors during 2021.\n\nThe table below shows the shareholder voting result in respect of our 2020 Remuneration report (approved by shareholders at the AGM held on  5 May 2021) and Directors' remuneration policy (approved by shareholders at the AGM held on 7 May 2020).\n\n## Previous AGM voting outcomes\n\n|                                                            | For  % of votes cast  Number   | Against  % of votes cast  Number   | Withheld Number   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Vote on the 2020 Remuneration Report at the 2021 AGM       | 99.25%                         | 0.75%                              |                   |\n|                                                            | 11,981,557,904                 | 90,709,782                         | 222,296,011       |\n| Vote on the Directors' remuneration policy at the 2020 AGM | 96.29%                         | 3.71%                              |                   |\n|                                                            | 11,308,670,932                 | 436,091,600                        | 201,020,969       |\n\nAt the AGM held on 24 April 2014, 96.02% (10,364,453,159 votes) of shareholders of Barclays PLC voted for the resolution in respect of a fixed to variable remuneration ratio of 1:2 for 'Remuneration Code Staff ' (now known as MRTs). On 14 December 2017, the Board of Barclays PLC as shareholder of Barclays Bank PLC approved the resolution that Barclays Bank PLC and any of its current and future subsidiaries be authorised to apply a ratio of the fixed to variable components of total remuneration of their MRTs that exceeds 1:1, provided the ratio does not exceed 1:2. On 15 November 2018, the Board of Barclays PLC as shareholder of Barclays Bank UK PLC approved an equivalent resolution in relation to MRTs within Barclays Bank UK PLC and any of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for overseeing Barclays' remuneration as described in more detail below.\n\n## Barclays Board Remuneration Committee\n\n## Terms of Reference\n\n- \u25a0 set the overarching principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group;\n\nThe role of the Committee is to:\n\n- \u25a0 consider and approve the remuneration arrangements of (i) the Chairman, (ii) the Executive Directors, (iii) members of the Barclays Group Executive Committee and any other senior executives specified by the Committee from time to time, and (iv) all other Group employees whose total annual compensation exceeds an amount determined by the Committee from time to time; and\n\nThe Committee considers the overarching objectives, principles and parameters of remuneration policy across the Group to ensure it is adopting a coherent approach in respect of all employees. In discharging this responsibility, the Committee seeks to ensure that the policy is fair and transparent, avoids complexity and assesses, among other things, the impact of pay arrangements in supporting the Group's culture, Values and strategy and on all elements of risk management. The Committee also approves incentive pools for each of the Group, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and BX, periodically reviews (at least annually) all material matters of retirement benefit design and governance, and exercises judgement in the application of remuneration policies to promote the long-term success of the Group for the benefit of shareholders. The Committee and its members work as necessary with other Board Committees, and the Committee is authorised to select and appoint its own advisers as required.\n\n- \u25a0 exercise oversight for remuneration issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are available at home.barclays/who-we-are/our-governance/board-committees",

In addition to advising the Committee, PwC provided unrelated consulting advice to the Group in respect of strategic advice on business, regulation, operational models and cost, corporate taxation, technology, pensions and HR issues.\n\nThe Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as the independent adviser in October 2017. The Committee considered the advice provided by PwC to the Committee during the year and was satisfied that the advice is independent and objective. PwC is a signatory to the voluntary code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nThroughout 2021, Willis Towers Watson (WTW) provided the Committee with market data on compensation as context when considering incentive levels and remuneration packages. WTW were paid \u00a385,000 (excluding VAT) in fees for their services. In addition to the services provided to the Committee, WTW also provides pensions and benefits advice and insurance brokerage services to Barclays Group, and pensions advice and administration services to a number of the Group's pension funds.\n\nNo Barclays employee or Director participates in discussions with, or decisions of, the Committee relating to his or her own remuneration. No other advisers provided services to the Committee in the year.\n\nIn the course of its deliberations, the Committee also considers the views of the Group Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Human Resources Director and the Group Reward and Performance Director. The Group Finance Director and the Group Chief Risk Officer provide regular updates on Group and business financial performance and risk profiles, respectively. The Head of Corporate Communications attended when requested to advise on reward communications and disclosures. The Group General Counsel and Company Secretary advised on legal and governance-related matters.\n\n## Committee effectiveness in 2021\n\nThe Board appointed Christopher Saul Associates (CSA) to facilitate the review. As part of its review, CSA conducted one-on-one interviews with each member of the Committee and the Group Human Resources Director. CSA also observed the November 2021 Committee meeting.\n\nThe 2021 Committee effectiveness review was externally facilitated, as required by the Code. The review is an important part of the way Barclays monitors and improves Committee performance and effectiveness, maximising strengths and highlighting areas for further development.\n\nFeedback from the review confirms that the Committee is operating effectively, with constructive engagement with management and appropriate challenge observed in meetings, coupled with balanced contributions from Committee members during meetings. Feedback also highlights that the Committee is able to make important decisions at pace. In addition, feedback noted that consideration was still being given to adding an additional member to the Committee in light of Crawford Gillies having stepped down in February 2021.\n\nThe following provides a summary of the Committee's activity during 2021 and at the January and February 2022 meetings at which 2021 remuneration decisions were finalised. The Committee is also provided with updates at each scheduled meeting on: operation of the Committee's Control Framework on hiring, retention and termination, headcount and employee attrition, and extant LTIP performance.\n\n## Committee activity in 2021\n\n|                                               |                                                                    | January  2021   | February  2021   | June   2021   | November  2021   | December  2021   | January  2022   | February  2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Overall                                       | Finance and Risk updates                                           | \u25a0               | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n| remuneration                                  | Incentive funding proposals including risk  adjustments            | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |               | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | 2020 Remuneration Report                                           |                 | \u25a0                |               |                  |                  |                 |                  |\n|                                               | Group Fixed Pay budgets                                            |                 | \u25a0                |               | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | Wider workforce considerations                                     | \u25a0               | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | Incentive funding approach                                         |                 |                  | \u25a0             |                  |                  |                 |                  |\n|                                               | Barclays' Fair Pay agenda and Report                               |                 | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | 2021 Remuneration Report                                           |                 |                  |               |                  | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n| Executive  Directors' and  senior executives' | Executive Directors' and senior executives'  bonus outcomes        | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |               |                  | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n| remuneration                                  | Annual bonus and LTIP performance measures  and target calibration | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |               |                  | \u25a0                | \u25a0               |                  |\n| Governance                                    | Regulatory and stakeholder matters                                 | \u25a0               | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | Discussion with independent adviser                                |                 | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               | \u25a0                |\n|                                               | Remuneration Review Panel update                                   |                 | \u25a0                | \u25a0             | \u25a0                | \u25a0                | \u25a0               |                  |\n|                                               | Review of Committee effectiveness                                  |                 | \u25a0                |               |                  |                  | \u25a0               |                  |\n\nThere were two additional Committee meetings, one each in April and October 2021, the first to consider remuneration for a number of senior positions and the second to consider the remuneration aspects related to the Group Chief Executive succession.",

The first line is responsible for identifying and managing the risks in which they are engaged in, developing a control framework, and escalating risk events to Risk and Compliance.\n- \u25a0 The Third line of defence is Internal Audit, who are responsible for providing independent assurance over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control over current, systemic and evolving risks.\n- \u25a0 The Second line is comprised of the Risk and Compliance functions. The role of the second line is to establish the limits, rules and constraints, policies and standards under which first line activities shall be performed, consistent with the risk appetite of the Group, and to monitor the performance of the first line against these limits, rules and constraints.  Controls for first line activities, especially those related to operational risk, will ordinarily be established by the control officers operating within the control framework of the firm. These will remain subject to supervision by the second line.\n- \u25a0 The Legal function provides support to all areas of the bank and is not formally part of any of the three lines, however, it is subject to second line oversight with respect to operational and conduct risks.\n\nCRO and other senior managers, as well as overview of Barclays PLC committees.\n\n- \u25a0 frameworks cover the management processes for a collection of related activities and define the associated policies used to govern them\n\nThe ERMF is complemented by frameworks, policies and standards which are mainly aligned to individual principal risks:\n\n- \u25a0 policies set out principles, control objectives and other core requirements for the activities of the Group.

        "page_content": "## Principal risks\n\nEach of the principal risks is overseen by an accountable executive within the Group who is responsible for the framework, policies and standards that set out associated responsibilities and expectations and detail the related requirements around risk management. In addition, certain risks span across more than one principal risk .\n\nThe ERMF identifies nine principal risks namely: credit risk, market risk, treasury and capital risk, climate risk, operational risk, model risk, conduct risk, reputation risk and legal risk. Note that climate risk was added in January 2022; see page 216 for more information.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nRisk appetite is approved by the Barclays PLC Board in aggregate and disseminated across legal entities and businesses, supported by limits to enable and control specific exposures and activities that have material concentration risk implications.\n\nRisk appetite is defined as the level of risk which the Group is prepared to accept in the conduct of their activities. It provides a basis for ongoing dialogue between management and Board with respect to the Group's current and evolving risk profile,  allowing strategic and financial decisions to be made on an informed basis.\n\n## Risk committees\n\nIn addition to setting the risk appetite of the Group, the Board is responsible for approving the ERMF, and reviewing all reputation risk matters. It receives regular information on the risk profile of the Group, and has ultimate responsibility for risk appetite and capital plans.\n\nBarclays  product/risk type committees consider risk matters relevant to their business, and escalate as required to the Group Risk Committee (GRC), whose Chairman, in turn, escalates to the Barclays PLC Board Committees and the Barclays PLC Board.\n\nFurther, there are two Board-level committees which oversee the application of the ERMF and implementation of key aspects, the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC). Additionally, the Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee oversee pay practices focusing on aligning pay to sustainable performance.\n\n- \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee (BRC): the BRC monitors the Group's risk profile against the agreed appetite. Where actual performance differs from expectations, the actions taken by management are reviewed to ascertain that the BRC is comfortable with them. The BRC also reviews certain key risk methodologies, the effectiveness of risk management, and the Group's risk profile, including the material issues affecting each business portfolio and forward risk trends. The committee also commissions in-depth analysis of significant risk topics, which are presented by the Group CRO or senior risk managers.\n- \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Remuneration Committee (RemCo): the RemCo receives proposals on ex-ante and ex-post risk adjustments to variable remuneration based on risk management performance including events, issues and the wider risk profile. These inputs are considered in the setting of performance incentives.\n- \u25a0 The Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee (BAC): the BAC receives regular reports on the effectiveness of internal control systems, quarterly reports on material control issues of significance, quarterly papers on accounting judgements (including impairment), and a quarterly review of the adequacy of impairment allowances, relative to the risk inherent in the portfolios, the business environment, and Barclays policies and methodologies.\n\nThe terms of reference and additional details on membership and activities for each of the principal Board committees are available from the corporate governance section of the Barclays website at: home.barclays/who-weare/our-governance/board-committees/\n\nThe GRC is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the risk profile of the Group. This includes coverage of all principal risks, and any other material risks, to which the Group is exposed. The GRC reviews and recommends the proposed risk appetite and relative limits to the BRC. The committee covers all business units and legal entities of the Group and incorporates specific coverage of Barclays Bank Group.\n\n## Barclays' risk culture\n\nBarclays is committed to maintaining a robust risk culture in which:\n\nRisk culture can be defined as the norms, attitudes and behaviours related to risk awareness, risk taking and risk management. This is reflected in how the Group identifies, escalates and manages risk matters.\n\n- \u25a0 management expect, model and reward the right behaviours from a risk and control perspective\n\nThe Group CEO works with the Executive Management to embed a strong risk culture within the firm, with particular regard to the identification, escalation and management of risk matters, in accordance with the ERMF. Specifically, all employees regardless of their positions, functions or locations must play their part in the Group's risk management. Employees are required to be familiar with risk management policies which are relevant to their responsibilities, know how to escalate actual or potential risk issues, and have a role-appropriate level of awareness of the risk management process as defined by the ERMF.\n\n- \u25a0 colleagues identify, manage and escalate risk and control matters, and meet their responsibilities around risk management.\n\n## Our Code of Conduct - the Barclays Way\n\nGlobally, all colleagues must attest to the 'Barclays Way', our Code of Conduct, and comply with all frameworks, policies and standards applicable to their roles. The Code of Conduct outlines the Purpose, Values and Mindset which govern our 'Barclays Way' of working across our business globally. It constitutes a reference point covering all aspects of colleagues' working relationships, and provides guidance on working with other Barclays employees, customers and clients, governments and regulators, business partners, suppliers, competitors and the broader community.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks to the Group's future performance\n\nThe Group has identified a broad range of risks to which its businesses are exposed. Material risks are those to which senior management pay particular attention and which could cause the delivery of the Group's strategy, results of operations, financial condition and/or prospects to differ materially from expectations. Emerging risks are those which have unknown components, the impact of which could crystallise over a longer time period. In addition, certain other factors beyond the Group's control, including escalation of terrorism or global conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and similar events, although not detailed below, could have a similar impact on the Group.\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks potentially impacting more than one principal risk\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a material impact on businesses around the world and the economic environments in which they operate. Additionally, the impacts of the economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and postrecovery environment, from a commercial, regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period. As a result, there are a number of factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on global economies that have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the profitability, capital and liquidity of the Group.\n\n## i) Risks relating to the impact of COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the Group's customers, suppliers and staff globally. Most jurisdictions in which the Group operates, implemented severe restrictions on the movement of their respective populations, with a resultant significant impact on economic activity in those jurisdictions. While a number of restrictions have been eased with the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccination programmes, others still remain in place and future developments are highly uncertain. In some jurisdictions, restrictions that had been previously lifted were re-imposed in response to a resurgence in cases. These decisions are being taken by the governments of individual jurisdictions (including through the implementation of emergency powers) and impacts (including any subsequent lifting, extension or reimposition of restrictions) may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and/or within jurisdictions. It remains unclear how the\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic will evolve through 2022 (including whether there will be further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether COVID-19 vaccines continue to prove effective, whether further new strains of COVID-19 will emerge and whether, and in what manner, additional restrictions will be imposed and/or existing restrictions extended) and the Group continues to monitor the situation closely.\n\nIn many of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates, schemes were initiated by central banks, national governments and regulators to provide financial support to parts of the economy most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid introduction and varying nature of these support schemes, as well as customer expectations, required the Group to implement large-scale changes in a short period of time, leading to an increase in certain risks faced by the Group, including operational risk, conduct risk, reputation risk and fraud risk. These risks are likely to be heightened further as and when those government and other support schemes expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported. Furthermore, the impact from participating in government and central bank-supported loan and other financing schemes may be exacerbated if the Group is required by any government or regulator to offer forbearance or additional financial relief to borrowers or if the Group is unable to rely on guarantees provided by governments in connection with financial support schemes.\n\nHowever, despite the COVID-19 contingency plans established by the Group, the ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by disruptions to infrastructure and supply chains, business processes and technology services, resulting from the unavailability of staff due to illness or the failure of third parties to supply services. This may cause significant customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Group's customers, potential litigation costs (including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions), and reputational damage.\n\nAs these schemes and other financial support schemes provided by national governments (such as job retention and furlough schemes, payment deferrals and mass lending schemes) expire, are withdrawn or are no longer supported, there is a risk that economic growth and employment may be negatively impacted which may, in turn, impact the Group's results of operations and profitability. In addition, the Group may experience a higher volume of defaults and delinquencies in certain portfolios which may negatively impact the Group's RWAs, level of impairment and, in turn, capital position, and may initiate collection and enforcement actions to recover defaulted debts. The inception of large-scale collections and recovery programmes (including the use of third party debt collection agents) may also create\n\nsignificant risk if (because of the complexity, speed and scale of these programmes) defaulting borrowers are harmed by the Group's conduct, which may also give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions, regulatory censure, potentially significant fines and other sanctions, and reputational damage. Other legal disputes may also arise between the Group and defaulting borrowers relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal rights or obligations arising under loan and other credit agreements. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Group's rights not being enforced as intended.\n\nFurthermore, the Group relies on models to support a broad range of business and risk management activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures (including the calculation of impairment), conducting stress testing and assessing capital adequacy. Models are, by their nature, imperfect and incomplete representations of reality because they rely on assumptions and inputs, and so they may be subject to errors affecting the accuracy of their outputs and/or misused. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. For further details on model risk, refer to 'vi) Model risk' below.\n\nChanges in macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment have a significant impact on the modelling of expected credit losses (ECLs) by the Group. As a result, the Group experienced higher ECLs in 2020 compared to prior periods though this trend was reversed in 2021 as economic conditions partially recovered. The economic environment remains uncertain and future impairment charges may be subject to further volatility (including from changes to macroeconomic variable forecasts) depending on the longevity of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures and the continued efficacy of any COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the longer- term effectiveness of central bank, government and other support measures. For further details on macroeconomic variables used in the calculation of ECLs, refer to the credit risk performance section. In addition, ECLs may be adversely impacted by increased levels of default for single name exposures in certain sectors directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic (such as the retail, airline, and hospitality and leisure sectors).\n\nThere can be no assurance that economic activity will return to pre-pandemic levels and, accordingly, there could be further adverse impacts on the Group's income and profitability caused by lower lending and transaction volumes due to volatility or weakness in the capital markets.

In particular:\n\nA deterioration in global or local economic and market conditions may lead to (among other things): (i) deteriorating business, consumer or investor confidence and lower levels of fixed asset investment and productivity growth, which in turn may lead to lower client activity, including lower demand for borrowing from creditworthy customers; (ii) higher default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges as borrowers struggle with the burden of additional debt; (iii) subdued asset prices and payment patterns, including the value of any collateral held by the Group; (iv) mark-to-market losses in trading portfolios resulting from changes in factors such as credit ratings, share prices and solvency of counterparties; and (v) revisions to calculated ECLs leading to increases in impairment allowances. In addition, the Group's ability to borrow from other financial institutions or raise funding from external investors may be affected by deteriorating economic conditions and market disruption.\n\n- \u25a0 Global GDP growth recovered in 2021 from the severe contraction in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While government support packages, accommodative monetary policy and the lifting of certain restrictions on movement bolstered economic growth and confidence in 2021, the global outlook remains highly uncertain, especially regarding: (a) ongoing concerns about how the COVID-19 pandemic may develop; (b) the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply chains; and (c) how long inflationary pressures will persist and whether central banks will succeed in normalising monetary policy. These factors\n\n- could adversely affect economic growth, affect specific industries or countries or affect the Group's employees and business operations in affected countries. Refer to i) Risks relating to the impact of COVID-19' above for further details.\n- \u25a0 Recent increases in inflation have been partly driven by a rebalancing of supply and demand, following the relaxation of restrictions on movement that were imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Monetary policy remains highly accommodative, increasing the risk that more abrupt government action will be necessary later if inflation does not prove transitory. A prolonged period of rising inflation may develop into slow or stagnant economic growth if combined with slowing economic expansion and elevated unemployment. Inflation may be further driven by supply chain disruptions and labour shortages, the imposition of further restrictions on movement due to the failure to contain the spread of COVID-19 and structural changes in the UK economy after the UK's exit from the European Union.\n- \u25a0 In the UK, the UK Government's subsidised job retention and furlough schemes, which were implemented as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, came to an end on 30 September 2021. Prior to the end of the job retention and furlough schemes, the UK labour market performed more favourably than initially predicted at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with low unemployment rates and the number of employees on UK company payrolls surpassing pre-pandemic levels. However, the end of the job retention and furlough schemes, exacerbated by further uncertainty arising from the impact of new strains of COVID-19 (including the Omicron variant), may cause upward pressure on unemployment which may result in higher impairment charges.\n- \u25a0 A significant proportion of the Group's portfolio is located in the US, including a major credit card portfolio and a range of corporate and investment banking exposures. The possibility of significant continued changes in US policy in certain sectors (including trade, healthcare and commodities) may have an impact on the Group's associated portfolios. Stress in the US economy, weakening GDP and the associated exchange rate fluctuations, heightened trade tensions (such as between the US and China), an unexpected rise in unemployment and/or an increase in interest rates could lead to increased levels of impairment, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and profitability.\n- \u25a0 An escalation in geopolitical tensions or increased use of protectionist measures may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business in the affected regions.\n- \u25a0 Trading disruption between the EU and the UK may have a significant impact on economic activity in the EU and the UK which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Unstable economic conditions could result in (among other things):\n- \u25a0 In China the pace of credit growth remains a concern, given the high level of leverage and despite government and regulatory action. A stronger than expected slowdown could result if authorities fail to manage growth appropriately during the transition from manufacturing towards services and the end of the investment and credit-led boom. Deterioration in emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations if contagion results in higher impairment charges via sovereign or counterparty defaults.\n- -a recession in the UK and/or one or more member states of the EEA in which it operates, with lower growth, higher unemployment and falling property prices, which could lead to increased impairments in relation to a number of the Group's portfolios (including, but not limited to, its UK mortgage portfolio, unsecured lending portfolio (including credit cards) and commercial real estate exposures)\n- -a credit rating downgrade for one or more members of the Group (either directly or indirectly as a result of a downgrade in the UK sovereign credit ratings), which could significantly increase the Group's cost of and/or reduce its access to funding, widen credit spreads and materially adversely affect the Group's interest margins and liquidity position and/or\n- -increased market volatility (in particular in currencies and interest rates), which could impact the Group's trading book positions and affect the underlying value of assets in the banking book and securities held by the Group for liquidity purposes\n- -a widening of credit spreads more generally or reduced investor appetite for the Group's debt securities, which could negatively impact the Group's cost of and/or access to funding.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\n## iii) The impact of interest rate changes on the Group's profitability\n\nA period of low interest rates and flat yield curves, including any rate cuts and/or negative interest rates, may affect and  put pressure on the Group's net interest margins (the difference between its lending income and borrowing costs) and could adversely affect the profitability and prospects of the Group.\n\nChanges to interest rates are significant for the Group, especially given the uncertainty as to the direction of interest rates and the pace at which they may change, particularly in the Group's main markets of the UK and the US.\n\nInterest rate rises could positively impact the Group's profitability as retail and corporate business income increases due to margin decompression. However, further increases in interest rates, if larger or more frequent than expected, could lead to generally weaker than expected growth, reduced business confidence and higher unemployment. This, combined with the impact interest rate rises may have on the affordability of loan arrangements for borrowers, could cause stress in the lending portfolio and underwriting activity of the Group with resultant higher credit losses driving an increased impairment charge which would most notably impact retail unsecured portfolios and wholesale non-investment grade lending and could have a material effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## iv) Competition in the banking and financial services industry\n\nIn addition, changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the value of the securities held in the Group's liquid asset portfolio. Consequently, this could create more volatility than expected through the Group's Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI) reserve.\n\nThe Group operates in a highly competitive environment (in particular, in the UK and US) in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and prevailing economic conditions. The Group expects that competition in the financial services industry will continue to be intense and may have a material adverse effect on the Group's future business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nNew competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. Technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for non- banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products such as electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by\n\ntechnologies, such as blockchain (used in cryptocurrency systems) and 'buy now pay later' lending, both of which are currently subject to lower levels of regulatory oversight. Furthermore, the introduction of Central Bank Digital Currencies could potentially have significant impacts on the banking system and the role of commercial banks within it by disrupting the current provision of banking products and services. It could allow new competitors, some previously hindered by banking regulation (such as FinTechs), to provide customers with access to banking facilities and increase disintermediation of banking services.\n\nOngoing or increased competition and/or disintermediation of banking services may put pressure on the pricing for the Group's products and services, which could reduce the Group's revenues and profitability, or may cause the Group to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits, bank accounts and mortgage lending. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of the Group's businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, underperformance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect the Group's ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce the Group's revenues.\n\nNew technologies have required and could require the Group to spend more to modify or adapt its products or make additional capital investments in its businesses to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies.\n\n## v) Regulatory change agenda and impact on business model\n\nThe Group remains subject to ongoing significant levels of regulatory change and scrutiny in many of the countries in which it operates (including, in particular, the UK and the US). As a result, regulatory risk will remain a focus for senior management. Furthermore, a more intensive regulatory approach and enhanced requirements together with the potential lack of international regulatory co-ordination as enhanced supervisory standards are developed and implemented may adversely affect the Group's business, capital and risk management strategies and/or may result in the Group deciding to modify its legal entity, capital and funding structures and business mix, or to exit certain business activities altogether or not to expand in areas despite otherwise attractive potential.\n\nThere are several significant pieces of legislation and areas of focus which will require considerable management attention, cost and resource, including:\n\n- -increasing capital, MREL or liquidity resources, reducing leverage and risk weighted assets\n- \u25a0 Changes in prudential requirements may impact minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) (including requirements for internal MREL), leverage, liquidity or funding requirements, applicable buffers and/or add-ons to such minimum requirements and risk weighted assets calculation methodologies all as may be set by international, EU or national authorities. This includes the upcoming implementation of the remaining Basel III reforms, as well as the expected incorporation of risks associated with climate change into the prudential framework and increased scrutiny of firms' governance and risk management frameworks (including in respect of climate change and Environmental, Social and Governance ( ESG ) risks). Such or similar changes to prudential requirements or additional supervisory and prudential expectations, as well as requirements imposed by the Group's regulators under the resolution framework, either individually or in aggregate, may result in, among other things, a need for further management actions to meet the changed requirements, such as:\n- -modifying the terms of outstanding capital instruments\n- -changing the Group's business mix or exiting other businesses and/or\n- -modifying legal entity structure (including with regard to issuance and deployment of capital, MREL and funding)\n- -undertaking other actions to strengthen the Group's position or resolvability.\n- \u25a0 The derivatives market has been the subject of particular focus for regulators in recent years across the G20 countries and beyond, with regulations introduced which require the on-venue trading and clearing of standardised over the counter (OTC) derivatives and the mandatory margining of non-cleared OTC derivatives. These regulations may increase costs for market participants, as well as reduce liquidity in the derivatives markets, in particular, if there are areas of overlapping or conflicting regulation. More broadly, changes to the regulatory framework could entail significant costs for market participants and may have a significant impact on certain markets in which the Group operates.",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 The Group and certain of its members are subject to supervisory stress testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions. These exercises currently include the programmes of the Bank of England, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Failure to meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests, or the failure by regulators to approve the stress test results and capital plans of the Group, could result in the Group or certain of its members being required to enhance their capital position, limit capital distributions or position additional capital in specific subsidiaries.\n\nFor further details on the regulatory supervision of, and regulations applicable to, the Group, refer to the Supervision and regulation section.\n\n- \u25a0 As a result of the on-shoring of EU legislation in the UK, UK-based entities within the Group are currently subject to substantially the same rules and regulations as prior to the UK's withdrawal from the EU. It is the UK's intention to recast on-shored EU legislation as part of UK legislation and PRA and FCA rules, which could result in changes to regulatory requirements in the UK. If the regulatory regimes for EU and UK financial services change further, the provision of cross-border banking and investment services across the Group may become more complex and costly which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and results of operations and could result in the Group modifying its legal entity, capital and funding structures and business mix, exiting certain business activities altogether or not expanding in areas despite otherwise attractive potential returns. This may also be exacerbated if Barclays Bank Ireland PLC expands further and, as a result of its growth and importance to the Group and the EEA banking system as a whole, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is made subject to higher capital requirements or restrictions are imposed by regulators, on capital allocation and capital distributions by Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\n## vi) Impact of benchmark interest rate reforms on the Group\n\nGlobal regulators and central banks in the UK, US and EU have been driving international efforts to reform key benchmark interest rates and indices, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which are used to determine the amounts payable under a wide range of transactions and make them more reliable and robust. These benchmark reforms have resulted in significant changes to the methodology and operation of certain benchmarks and indices,\n\nthe adoption of alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs), the discontinuation of certain reference rates (including LIBOR), and the introduction of implementing legislation and regulations. Specifically, regulators in the UK, US and EU directed that certain non-US dollar LIBOR tenors would cease at the end of 2021. Furthermore, certain US dollar LIBOR tenors are to cease by the end of June 2023, and restrictions have been imposed on new use of US dollar LIBOR. Notwithstanding these developments, given the unpredictable consequences of benchmark reform, any of these developments could have an adverse impact on market participants, including the Group, in respect of any financial instruments linked to, or referencing, any of these benchmark interest rates. Uncertainty associated with such potential changes, including the availability and/ or suitability of alternative RFRs, the participation of customers and third party market participants in the transition process, challenges with respect to required documentation changes, and impact of legislation to deal with certain legacy contracts that cannot convert into or add fall-back RFRs before cessation of the benchmark they reference, may adversely affect a broad range of transactions (including any securities, loans and derivatives which use LIBOR or any other affected benchmark to determine the interest payable which are included in the Group's financial assets and liabilities) that use these reference rates and indices, and present a number of risks for the Group, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 Conduct risk: in undertaking actions to transition away from using certain reference rates (such as LIBOR) to new alternative RFRs, the Group faces conduct risks. These may lead to customer complaints, regulatory sanctions or reputational impact if the Group is considered to be (among other things): (i) undertaking market activities that are manipulative or create a false or misleading impression; (ii) misusing sensitive information or not identifying or appropriately managing or mitigating conflicts of interest; (iii) providing customers with inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service; (iv) not taking a consistent approach to remediation for customers in similar circumstances; (v) unduly delaying the communication and migration activities in relation to client exposure, leaving them insufficient time to prepare; or (vi) colluding or inappropriately sharing information with competitors.\n- \u25a0 Litigation risk: members of the Group may face legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and/or other actions or proceedings regarding (among other things): (i) the conduct risks identified above, (ii) the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR-based contracts, and (iii) the Group's preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative RFRs.\n- \u25a0 Pricing risk : changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or indices and transition to alternative RFRs may impact the pricing mechanisms used by the Group on certain transactions.\n- \u25a0 Financial risk: the valuation of certain of the Group's financial assets and liabilities may change. Moreover, transitioning to alternative RFRs may impact the ability of members of the Group to calculate and model amounts receivable by them on certain financial assets and determine the amounts payable on certain financial liabilities (such as debt securities issued by them) because certain alternative RFRs (such as the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) are look-back rates whereas term rates (such as LIBOR) allow borrowers to calculate at the start of any interest period exactly how much is payable at the end of such interest period. This may have a material adverse effect on the Group's cash flows.\n- \u25a0 Operational risk: changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or index and transition to alternative RFRs may require changes to the Group's IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure, operational processes, and controls. In addition, if any reference rate or index (such as LIBOR) is no longer available to calculate amounts payable, the Group may incur additional expenses in amending documentation for new and existing transactions and/or effecting the transition from the original reference rate or index to a new reference rate or index.\n\nAny of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.\n\n- \u25a0 Accounting risk: an inability to apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 could lead to increased volatility in the Group's financial results and performance.\n\nFor further details on the impacts of benchmark interest rate reforms on the Group, refer to Note 41.",

In addition, whilst the Group continues to pursue cost management initiatives, they may not be as effective as expected and cost saving targets may not be met.\n\nThe Group will need to adapt and/or transform the way it conducts business in response to changing customer behaviour and needs, technological developments, regulatory expectations, increased competition and cost management initiatives. Accordingly, effective management of transformation projects is required to successfully deliver the Group's strategic priorities, involving delivering both on externally driven programmes, as well as key business initiatives to deliver revenue growth, product enhancement and operational efficiency outcomes. The magnitude, complexity and, at times, concurrent demands of the projects required to meet these priorities can result in heightened execution risk.\n\nThe failure to successfully deliver or achieve any of the expected benefits of these strategic initiatives and/or the failure to meet customer and stakeholder expectations could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, customer outcomes, prospects and reputation.\n\nBarclays PLC is a holding company and its principal sources of income are, and are expected to continue to be, distributions (in the form of dividends and interest payments) from operating subsidiaries which also hold the principal assets of the Group. As a separate legal entity, Barclays PLC relies on such distributions in order to be able to meet its obligations as they fall due (including its payment obligations with respect to its debt securities) and to create distributable reserves for payment of dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\n## viii) Holding company structure of Barclays PLC and its dependency on distributions from its subsidiaries\n\nThe ability of Barclays PLC's subsidiaries to pay dividends and interest and Barclays PLC's ability to receive such distributions from its investments in its subsidiaries and other entities will be subject not only to the financial performance of such subsidiaries and entities and prevailing macroeconomic conditions but also to applicable local laws, capital regulations (including internal MREL requirements) and other restrictions (including restrictions imposed by governments and/or regulators, which limit management's flexibility in managing the business and taking action in relation to capital distributions and capital allocation). These laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to\n\nBarclays PLC by its subsidiaries and any other entities in which it holds an investment from time to time, which could restrict Barclays PLC's ability to meet its obligations and/or to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\nUnder the Banking Act 2009, as amended (Banking Act), substantial powers are granted to the Bank of England (or, in certain circumstances, HM Treasury), in consultation with the PRA, the FCA and HM Treasury, as appropriate, as part of a special resolution regime (SRR). These powers enable the relevant UK resolution authority to implement resolution measures and stabilisation options with respect to a UK bank or investment firm and certain of its affiliates (currently including Barclays PLC) (each, a relevant entity) in circumstances in which the relevant UK resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met.\n\n## ix) Application of resolution measures and stabilisation powers under the Banking Act\n\nThe SRR consists of five stabilisation options: (i) private sector transfer of all or part of the business or shares of the relevant entity; (ii) transfer of all or part of the business of the relevant entity to a 'bridge bank' established by the Bank of England; (iii) transfer to an asset management vehicle wholly or partly owned by HM Treasury or the Bank of England; (iv) the cancellation, transfer or dilution of the relevant entities' equity (including Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital) and write-down or conversion of the relevant entity's capital instruments and liabilities (the bail-in tool); and (v) temporary public ownership (i.e. nationalisation).\n\nShareholders should assume that, in a resolution situation, public financial support will only be available to a relevant entity as a last resort after the relevant UK resolution authorities have assessed and used, to the maximum extent practicable, the resolution tools, including the bail-in tool (the Bank of England's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC). The exercise of any of such powers under the Banking Act or any suggestion of any such exercise could materially adversely affect the value of Barclays PLC ordinary shares and could lead to shareholders losing some or all of their investment.\n\nIn addition, the relevant UK resolution authority may, in certain circumstances, in accordance with the Banking Act require the permanent write-down or conversion into equity of any outstanding Tier 1 capital instruments, Tier 2 capital instruments and internal MREL prior to, or together with, the exercise of any stabilisation option. Any such action could result in the dilution of Barclays PLC's ordinary share capital, restrict Barclays PLC's ability to meet its obligations and/or to pay dividends to ordinary shareholders.\n\nIn addition, any safeguards within the Banking Act (such as the 'no creditor worse off' principle) may not result in compensation to shareholders that is equivalent to the full losses incurred by them in the resolution and there can be no assurance that shareholders would recover such compensation promptly.\n\n## i) Climate risk\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks impacting individual principal risks\n\nThe risks associated with climate change are subject to rapidly increasing societal, regulatory and political focus, both in the UK and internationally. Embedding climate risk into the Group's risk framework in line with regulatory expectations and requirements, and adapting the Group's operations and strategy to address the financial risks resulting from both: (i) the physical risk of climate change; and (ii) the risk from the transition to a low-carbon economy, could have a significant impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, the Group's customers and clients and the creditworthiness of the Group's counterparties.\n\nThe potential impact on the economy includes, but is not limited to, lower GDP growth, higher unemployment and significant changes in asset prices and profitability of industries. Damage to properties and operations of borrowers could impair asset values and the creditworthiness of customers leading to increased default rates, delinquencies, write-offs and impairment charges in the Group's portfolios. In addition, the Group's premises and resilience may also suffer physical damage due to weather events leading to increased costs for the Group.\n\nPhysical risks from climate change arise from a number of factors and relate to specific weather events and longer-term shifts in the climate. The nature and timing of extreme weather events are uncertain but they are increasing in frequency and their impact on the economy is predicted to be more acute in the future.\n\nAs the economy transitions to a low-carbon economy, financial institutions such as the Group may face significant and rapid developments in stakeholder expectations, policy, law and regulation which could impact the lending activities the Group undertakes, as well as the risks associated with its lending portfolios, and the value of the Group's financial assets. As sentiment towards climate change shifts and societal preferences change, the Group may face greater scrutiny of the type of business it conducts, adverse media coverage and reputational damage, which may in turn impact customer demand for the Group's products, returns on certain business activities and the value of certain assets and trading positions resulting in impairment charges.",

        "page_content": "S\n\nE\n\nS\n\nG report\n\nShareholder information\n\nRisk review\n\nFinancial review\n\nIn addition, the impacts of physical and transition climate risks can lead to second order connected risks, which have the potential to affect the Group's retail and wholesale portfolios. The impacts of climate change may increase losses for those sectors sensitive to the effects of physical and transition risks. For example, the Group's UK mortgage and agriculture portfolios are particularly exposed to both the physical and transition risks of climate change. The mortgage portfolio is affected by the risks of flooding, subsidence and energy efficiency performance requirements, all of which may impact property valuations, whilst the agriculture portfolio is exposed to flooding and drought, as well as the potential for legislative changes and changes in consumer behaviour. Furthermore, any subsequent increase in defaults and rising unemployment could create recessionary pressures, which may lead to wider deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Group's clients, higher ECLs, and increased charge-offs and defaults among retail customers.\n\nIn March 2020, the Group announced its ambition to become a net zero bank by 2050 and its commitment to align all of its financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement. In order to reach these ambitions and targets or any other climaterelated ambitions or targets the Group may commit to in future, the Group will need to incorporate climate considerations into its strategy, business model, the products and services it provides to customers and its financial and non-financial risk management processes (including processes to measure and manage the various financial and non-financial risks the Group faces as a result of climate change). The Group also needs to ensure that its strategy and business model adapt to changing national and international standards, industry and scientific practices, regulatory requirements and market expectations regarding climate change, which remain under continuous development and are subject to different interpretations. There can be no assurance that these standards, practices,\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2022, climate risk became one of the principal risks within the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework. Failure to adequately embed risks associated with climate change into its risk framework to appropriately measure, manage and disclose the various financial and operational risks it faces as a result of climate change or failure to adapt the Group's  strategy and business model to the changing regulatory requirements and market expectations on a timely basis, may have a material and adverse impact on the Group's level of business growth, competitiveness, profitability, capital requirements, cost of funding, and financial condition.\n\nrequirements and expectations will not be interpreted differently than what was the Group's understanding when defining its climate-related ambitions and targets, or change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for the Group to achieve such ambitions and targets. In addition, the Group's ambitions and targets may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve under such changing circumstances. This may be exacerbated if the Group chooses or is required to accelerate its climate-related ambitions or targets as a result of (among other things) UK or international regulatory developments or stakeholder expectations. Achieving the Group's climate-related ambitions and targets will also depend on a number of factors outside the Group's control, including (among other things) availability of data to measure and assess the climate impact of the Group's customers, advancements of lowcarbon technologies and supportive public policies in the markets where the Group operates. If these external factors and other changes do not occur, or do not occur on a timely basis, the Group may fail to achieve its climate-related ambitions and targets and this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.\n\n## ii) Credit risk\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to climate change, refer to the climate change risk management section.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss to the Group from the failure of clients, customers or counterparties, including sovereigns, to fully honour their obligations to members of the Group, including the whole and timely payment of principal, interest, collateral and other receivables.\n\nImpairment is calculated in line with the requirements of IFRS9 which results in recognition of loss allowances, based on ECLs, on a forward-looking basis using a broad scope of financial instruments. Measurement involves complex judgement and impairment charges are potentially volatile, particularly under stressed conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## a) Impairment\n\nFor further details, refer to Note 7.\n\n## b) Specific sectors and concentrations\n\nThe Group is subject to risks arising from changes in credit quality and recovery rates of loans and advances due from borrowers and counterparties in any specific portfolio. Any deterioration in credit quality could lead to lower recoverability and higher impairment in a specific sector. The following are areas of uncertainties to the Group's portfolio which could have a material impact on performance:\n\n- \u25a0 UK retail, hospitality and leisure: softening demand, rising costs and a structural shift to online shopping, which have been exacerbated due to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and changes in consumer behaviour, continue to pressurise the UK High Street and other sectors heavily reliant on consumer discretionary spending. As these sectors continue to reposition themselves, the trend represents a potential risk in the Group's UK corporate portfolio as a higher probability of default exists for retailers, hospitality providers and their landlords while this transition takes place.\n- \u25a0 UK real estate market: UK property represents a significant portion of the overall Group retail and corporate credit exposure. In 2021, property prices rose, particularly in the residential property market where customers took advantage of temporary changes in stamp duty rates or sought more space as home working became more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there can be no assurance that house price growth will continue in 2022. House price growth and fewer new high loan-to-value (LTV) mortgages in 2020 and the beginning of 2021 have diluted the Group's high LTV stock to very low levels but there is potential for house prices to fall, especially in London and the South East of the UK where the Group has a high exposure. In addition, small segments of the housing market could be subject to specific valuation impacts (for example, certain properties within the Group's residential loan portfolio may be subject to remediation activities relating to fire safety standards). The Group's corporate exposure is vulnerable to the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 stress, with particular weakness in retail property as a result of reduced rent collections and residential development constrained by supply chain issues. The Group remains at risk of increased impairment from a material fall in property prices.\n- \u25a0 Consumer affordabili t y : this has remained a key area of focus, particularly in unsecured lending. Macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment, higher interest rates or broader inflationary pressures, that impact a customer's ability to service debt payments could lead to increased arrears in both unsecured and secured products.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\n- \u25a0 Leverage finance underwriting: the Group takes on sub-investment grade underwriting exposure, including single name risk, particularly in the US and Europe. The Group is exposed to credit events and market volatility during the underwriting period. Any adverse events during this period may potentially result in loss for the Group, or an increased capital requirement should there be a need to hold the exposure for an extended period.\n- \u25a0 Air travel: the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant reduction in demand for air travel as both the willingness and ability to travel have reduced, impacting revenues of the Group's clients and their ability to service their debt obligations. While the situation is expected to improve as travel restrictions are eased, changes in consumer behaviour both due to COVID-19 and climate change create uncertainty for the sector. Furthermore, the possibility of further global and regional pandemics pose additional risks for the sector.\n- \u25a0 Oil & Gas sector: the Group's corporate credit exposure includes companies whose performance is dependent on the oil and gas sector. Whilst market prices have recovered in 2021, a sustained period of lower energy prices in recent years has led to the erosion of balance sheet strength, particularly for higher cost producers and those businesses which supply goods and services to the oil and gas sector. In the longer term, costs associated with the transition towards renewable sources of energy may place greater financial demands on companies that the Group has exposure to globally. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects through increased impairment charges.\n\nThe Group also has large individual exposures to single name counterparties, both in its lending activities and in its financial services and trading activities, including transactions in derivatives and transactions with brokers, central clearing houses, dealers, other banks, mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients. The default of such counterparties could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets. In addition, where such counterparty risk has been mitigated by taking collateral, credit risk may remain high if the collateral held cannot be monetised, or has to be liquidated at prices which are insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. Any such defaults could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results due to, for example, increased credit losses and higher impairment charges.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to credit risk, refer to the credit risk management and credit risk performance sections.\n\n## iii) Market risk\n\nEconomic and financial market uncertainties remain elevated, as the path of the COVID-19 pandemic is inherently difficult to predict. Further waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, a disruptive adjustment to monetary policy normalisation, intensifying social unrest that weighs on market sentiment, and deteriorating trade and geopolitical tensions are some of the factors that could heighten market risks for the Group's portfolios.\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations.\n\nIn addition, the Group's trading business is generally exposed to a prolonged period of elevated asset price volatility, particularly if it adversely affects market liquidity. Such a scenario could impact the Group's ability to execute client trades and may also result in lower client flow-driven income and/or market-based losses on its existing portfolio of market risks. These can include higher hedging costs from rebalancing risks that need to be managed dynamically as market levels and their associated volatilities change.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to market risk, refer to the market risk management and market risk performance sections.\n\nIt is difficult to predict changes in market conditions, and such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## iv) Treasury and capital risk\n\n## a) Liquidity risk\n\nThere are three primary types of treasury and capital risk faced by the Group:\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets. This could cause the Group to fail to meet internal and/or regulatory liquidity requirements, make repayments as they fall due or be unable to support day-to-day banking activities. Key liquidity risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u25a0 Stability of the Group's deposit funding profile: deposits which are payable on demand or at short notice could be affected by the Group failing to preserve the current level of customer and investor confidence.\n- \u25a0 Ongoing access to wholesale funding: the Group regularly accesses the money and capital markets to provide short-term and long-term unsecured and secured funding to support its operations. A loss of counterparty confidence, or adverse market conditions could lead to a reduction in the tenor, or an increase in the costs, of the Group's unsecured and secured wholesale funding.\n- \u25a0 Intraday liquidity usage : increased collateral requirements at payments and securities settlement systems could negatively impact the Group's liquidity position, as cash and liquid assets required for intraday purposes are unavailable to meet other outflows.\n- \u25a0 Impacts of market volatility : adverse market conditions, with increased volatility in asset prices can negatively impact the Group's liquidity position through increased derivative margin requirements and/or wider haircuts when monetising liquidity pool securities, and make it more difficult to execute secured financing transactions.\n- \u25a0 Off-balance sheet commitments : deterioration in economic and market conditions could cause customers to draw on off-balance sheet commitments provided to them, for example revolving credit facilities, negatively affecting the Group's liquidity position.\n- \u25a0 Credit rating changes and the impact on funding costs: any reductions in a credit rating (in particular, any downgrade below investment grade) may affect the Group's access to the money or capital markets and/ or terms on which the Group is able to obtain market funding (for example, this could lead to increased costs of funding and wider credit spreads, the triggering of additional collateral or other requirements in derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements, or limits on the range of counterparties who are willing to enter into transactions with the Group).",

    {
        "page_content": "## b) Capital risk\n\n- \u25a0 Failure to meet prudential capital requirements: this could lead to the Group being unable to support some or all of its business activities, a failure to pass regulatory stress tests, increased cost of funding due to deterioration in investor appetite or credit ratings, restrictions on distributions including the ability to meet dividend targets, and/or the need to take additional measures to strengthen the Group's capital or leverage position.\n\nCapital risk is the risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory stress testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans. Key capital risks that the Group faces include:\n\n- \u25a0 Adverse changes in FX rates impacting capital ratios: the Group has capital resources, risk weighted assets and leverage exposures denominated in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact the sterling equivalent value of these items. As a result, the Group's regulatory capital ratios are sensitive to foreign currency movements. Failure to appropriately manage the Group's balance sheet to take account of foreign currency movements could result in an adverse impact on the Group's regulatory capital and leverage ratios.\n- \u25a0 Adverse movements in the pension fund: adverse movements in pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension schemes could result in deficits on a technical provision and/or IAS 19 accounting basis. This could lead to the Group making substantial additional contributions to its pension plans and/or a deterioration in its capital position. Under IAS 19, the liabilities discount rate is derived from the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Therefore, the valuation of the Group's defined benefits schemes would be adversely affected by a prolonged fall in the discount rate due to a persistent low interest rate and/or credit spread environment. Inflation is another significant risk driver to the pension fund as the liabilities are adversely impacted by an increase in long-term inflation expectations.\n\nc) Interest rate risk in the banking book Interest rate risk in the banking book is the risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities. The Group's hedging programmes for interest rate risk in the banking book rely on behavioural assumptions and, as a result, the effectiveness of the hedging strategy cannot be guaranteed. A potential mismatch in the balance or duration of the hedging assumptions could lead to earnings deterioration. A decline in interest rates in sterling, US dollars or euros may also compress net interest margin on retail and corporate portfolios. In addition, the Group's liquid asset portfolio is exposed to potential capital and/or income volatility due to movements in market rates and prices which may have a material adverse effect on the capital position of the Group.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to treasury and capital risk, refer to the treasury and capital risk management and treasury and capital risk performance sections.\n\n## v) Operational risk\n\n## a) Operational resilience\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks. Examples include:\n\nThe Group functions in a highly competitive market, with market participants that expect consistent and smooth business processes. The loss of or disruption to business processing is a material inherent risk within the Group and across the financial services industry, whether arising through impacts on the Group's technology systems, real estate services including its retail branch network, or availability of personnel or services supplied by third parties. Failure to build resilience and recovery capabilities into business processes or into the services of technology, real estate or suppliers on which the Group's business processes depend, may result in significant customer detriment, costs to reimburse losses incurred by the Group's customers, and reputational damage.\n\nCyberattacks continue to be a global threat that is inherent across all industries, with the number and severity of attacks continuing to rise. The financial sector remains a primary target for cybercriminals, hostile nation states, opportunists and hacktivists. The Group, like other financial institutions, experiences numerous attempts to compromise its cybersecurity.\n\n## b) Cyberattacks\n\nThe Group dedicates significant resources to reducing cybersecurity risks, but it cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks. Malicious actors are increasingly sophisticated in their methods, seeking to steal money, gain unauthorised access to, destroy or manipulate data, and disrupt operations, and some of their attacks may not be recognised until launched, such as zero-day attacks that are launched before patches and defences can be readied. Cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources and target the Group in numerous ways, including attacks on networks, systems, or devices used by the Group or parties such as service providers and other suppliers, counterparties, employees, contractors, customers or clients, presenting the Group with a vast and complex defence perimeter. Moreover, the Group does not have direct control over the cybersecurity of the systems of its clients, customers, counterparties and third party service providers and suppliers, limiting the Group's ability to effectively defend against certain threats. Some of the Group's third party service providers and suppliers have experienced successful attempts to compromise their cybersecurity. These included ransomware attacks that disrupted the service providers' or suppliers' operations and, in some cases, had a limited impact on the Group's operations. Such cyberattacks are likely to continue.\n\nA failure in the Group's adherence to its cybersecurity policies, procedures or controls, employee malfeasance, and human, governance or technological error could also compromise the Group's ability to successfully defend against cyberattacks. Furthermore, certain legacy technologies that are at or approaching end-of-life may not be able to maintain acceptable levels of security. The Group has experienced cybersecurity incidents and near-misses in the past, and it is inevitable that additional incidents will occur in the future. Cybersecurity risks will continue to increase, due to factors such as the increasing demand across the industry and customer expectations for continued expansion of services delivered over the internet; increasing reliance on internetbased products, applications and data storage; and changes in ways of working by the Group's employees, contractors, and third party service providers and suppliers and their subcontractors as a potentially long-term consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bad actors have taken advantage of remote working practices and modified customer behaviours that have taken hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, exploiting the situation in novel ways that may elude defences.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\nCommon types of cyberattacks include deployment of malware to obtain covert access to systems and data; ransomware attacks that render systems and data unavailable through encryption; denial of service and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks; infiltration via business email compromise; social engineering, including phishing, vishing and smishing; automated attacks using botnets; and credential validation or stuffing attacks using login and password pairs from unrelated breaches. A successful cyberattack of any type has the potential to cause serious harm to the Group or its clients and customers, including exposure to potential contractual liability, litigation, regulatory or other government action, loss of existing or potential customers, damage to the Group's brand and reputation, and other financial loss. The impact of a successful cyberattack is also likely to include operational consequences (such as unavailability of services, networks, systems, devices or data), remediation of which could come at significant cost.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to cyberattacks, refer to the operational risk performance section. For further details on cyber security regulation applicable to the Group, refer to the Supervision and regulation section.\n\nRegulators worldwide continue to recognise cybersecurity as an increasing systemic risk to the financial sector and have highlighted the need for financial institutions to improve their monitoring and control of, and resilience to cyberattacks. A successful cyberattack may, therefore, result in significant regulatory fines for the Group.\n\n## c) New and emergent technology\n\nTechnology is fundamental to the Group's business and the financial services industry. Technological advancements present opportunities to develop new and innovative ways of doing business across the Group, with new solutions being developed both in-house and in association with third party companies. For example, payment services and securities, futures and options trading are increasingly occurring electronically, both on the Group's own systems and through other alternative systems, and becoming automated. Whilst increased use of electronic payment and trading systems and direct electronic access to trading markets could significantly reduce the Group's cost base, it may, conversely, reduce the commissions, fees and margins made by the Group on these transactions which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nIntroducing new forms of technology, however, has the potential to increase inherent risk. Failure to evaluate, actively manage and closely monitor risk exposure during all phases of business development could introduce new vulnerabilities and security flaws and have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe nature of fraud is wide-ranging and continues to evolve, as criminals continually seek opportunities to target the Group's business activities and exploit changes to customer behaviour and product and channel use (such as the increased use of digital products and enhanced online services) or exploit new products. Fraud attacks can be very sophisticated and are often orchestrated by highly organised crime groups who use ever more sophisticated techniques to target customers and clients directly to obtain confidential or personal information that can be used to commit fraud. The UK market has also seen significant growth in 'scams' where the Group takes increased levels of liability as part of a voluntary code to provide additional safeguards to customers and clients who are tricked into making payments to fraudsters. The impact from fraud can lead to customer detriment, financial losses (including the reimbursement of losses incurred by customers), loss of business, missed business opportunities and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## d) External fraud\n\n## e) Data management and information protection\n\nThe Group holds and processes large volumes of data, including personal information, intellectual property, and financial data and the Group's businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include: (i) the Group's clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers; (ii) clients and customers of the Group's clients and customers; (iii) employees and prospective employees; and (iv) employees of the Group's suppliers, counterparties and other external parties. The international nature of both the Group's business and its IT infrastructure also means that personal information may be available in countries other than those from where it originated. Accordingly, the Group needs to ensure that its collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies\n\nwith all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions (including as such new and existing regulations continue to be implemented, interpreted and applied), which could: (i) increase the Group's compliance and operating costs, particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data protection and data transfer mechanisms are in place; (ii) impact the development of new products or services, impact the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers; (iii) demand significant oversight by the Group's management; and (iv) require the Group to review some elements of the structure of its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Group's measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could expose the Group to the risk of loss or unavailability of data or data integrity issues and/ or cause the Group to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce the Group's revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by the Group to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations (and the evolving standards imposed by data protection authorities in connection therewith) may subject it to potential contractual liability, litigation, regulatory or other government investigation or action (including significant regulatory fines) and require changes to certain operations or practices which could also inhibit the Group's development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers. Any of these events could damage the Group's reputation, subject the Group to material fines or other monetary penalties, make the Group liable to the payment of compensatory damages, divert management's time and attention, lead to enhanced regulatory oversight and otherwise materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nFor further details on data protection regulation applicable to the Group, refer to the supervision and regulation section.\n\n## f) Algorithmic trading\n\nIn some areas of the investment banking business, trading algorithms are used to price and risk manage client and principal transactions. An algorithmic error could result in erroneous or duplicated transactions, a system outage, or impact the Group's pricing abilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation.",

        "page_content": "## g) Processing errors\n\nProcessing errors could result in the Group, among other things: (i) failing to provide information, services and liquidity to clients and counterparties in a timely manner; (ii) failing to settle and/or confirm transactions; (iii) causing funds transfers, capital markets trades and/or other transactions to be executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences; and (iv) adversely affecting financial, trading or currency markets. Any of these events could materially disadvantage the Group's customers, clients and counterparties (including them suffering financial loss) and/or result in a loss of confidence in the Group which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe Group's businesses are highly dependent on its ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a very large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex and occur at high volumes and frequencies, across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. As the Group's customer base and geographical reach expand and the volume, speed, frequency and complexity of transactions, especially electronic transactions (as well as the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and exchanges) increase, developing, maintaining and upgrading operational systems and infrastructure becomes more challenging, and the risk of systems or human error in connection with such transactions increases, as well as the potential consequences of such errors due to the speed and volume of transactions involved and the potential difficulty associated with discovering errors quickly enough to limit the resulting consequences. Furthermore, events that are wholly or partially beyond the Group's control, such as a spike in transaction volume, could adversely affect the Group's ability to process transactions or provide banking and payment services.\n\n## h) Supplier exposure\n\nThe Group depends on suppliers for the provision of many of its services and the development of technology. Whilst the Group depends on suppliers, it remains fully accountable for any risk arising from the actions of suppliers. The dependency on suppliers and sub-contracting of outsourced services introduces concentration risk where the failure of specific suppliers could have an impact on the Group's ability to continue to provide material services to its customers. Failure to adequately manage supplier risk could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\n## i) Estimates and judgements relating to critical accounting policies and regulatory disclosures\n\n## j) Tax risk\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the application of accounting policies and judgements to be made in accordance with IFRS. Regulatory returns and capital disclosures are prepared in accordance with the relevant capital reporting requirements and also require assumptions and estimates to be made. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements, include credit impairment provisions, taxes, fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions and post-retirement benefits, and provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters (refer to the notes to the audited financial statements for further details). There is a risk that if the judgement exercised, or the estimates or assumptions used, subsequently turn out to be incorrect, this could result in material losses to the Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for. Further development of accounting standards and regulatory interpretations could also materially impact the Group's results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nThe Group is required to comply with the domestic and international tax laws and practice of all countries in which it has business operations. There is a risk that the Group could suffer losses due to additional tax charges, other financial costs or reputational damage as a result of failing to comply with such laws and practice, or by failing to manage its tax affairs in an appropriate manner, with much of this risk attributable to the international structure of the Group. In addition, increasing tax authority focus on reporting and disclosure requirements around the world and the digitisation of the administration of tax has potential to increase the Group's tax compliance obligations further. For example, the OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting has announced plans to introduce a global minimum tax from 2023 which, if enacted, will increase the Group's tax compliance obligations. In addition, the proposed Build Back Better Act includes proposals to implement changes to US international tax provisions which may require systems and process changes if enacted. Any systems and process changes associated with these changes introduce additional operational risk.\n\n## k) Ability to hire and retain appropriately qualified employees\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to operational risk, refer to the operational risk management and operational risk performance sections.\n\nAs a regulated financial institution, the Group requires diversified and specialist skilled colleagues. The Group's ability to attract, develop and retain a diverse mix of talent is key to the delivery of its core business activity and strategy. This is impacted by a range of external and internal factors, such as potential effects on employee engagement and wellbeing from long-term periods of working remotely. Failure to attract or prevent the departure of appropriately qualified and skilled employees could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, this may result in disruption to service which could in turn lead to disenfranchising certain customer groups, customer detriment and reputational damage.\n\n## vi) Model risk\n\nModels are, by their nature, imperfect representations of reality and have some degree of uncertainty because they rely on assumptions and inputs, and so are subject to intrinsic uncertainty, errors and inappropriate use affecting the accuracy of their outputs. This may be exacerbated when dealing with unprecedented scenarios, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the lack of reliable historical reference points and data. For instance, the quality of the data used in models across the Group has a material impact on the accuracy and completeness of its risk and financial metrics. Model uncertainty, errors and inappropriate use may result in (among other things) the Group making inappropriate business decisions and/or inaccuracies or errors in the Group's risk management and regulatory reporting processes. This could result in significant financial loss, imposition of additional capital requirements, enhanced regulatory supervision and reputational damage, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nModel risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. The Group relies on models to support a broad range of business and risk management activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures (including the calculation of impairment), conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, supporting new business acceptance and risk and reward evaluation, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to model risk, refer to the model risk management and model risk performance sections.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Material existing and emerging risks continued\n\n## vii) Conduct risk\n\n## a) Market integrity\n\nConduct risk is the risk of poor outcomes for, or harm to, customers, clients and markets, arising from the delivery of the Group's products and services. This risk could manifest itself in a variety of ways, including:\n\nThe Group's businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compliance with its policies and standards and instances of wilful and negligent misconduct by employees, all of which could result in potential customer and client detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), increased operation and compliance costs, redress or remediation or reputational damage which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Examples of employee misconduct which could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business include: (i) employees improperly selling or marketing the Group's products and services; (ii) employees engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorised trading; or (iii) employees misappropriating confidential or proprietary information belonging to the Group, its customers or third parties. These risks may be exacerbated in circumstances where the Group is unable to rely on physical oversight and supervision of employees (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic where employees have worked remotely).\n\nThe Group must ensure that its customers, particularly those that are vulnerable, are able to make well-informed decisions on how best to use the Group's financial services and understand that they are appropriately protected if something goes wrong. Poor customer outcomes can result from the failure to: (i) communicate fairly and clearly with customers; (ii) provide services in a timely and fair manner; (iii) handle and protect customer data appropriately; and (iv) undertake appropriate activity to address customer detriment, including the adherence to regulatory and legal requirements on complaint handling. The Group is at risk of financial loss and reputational damage as a result.\n\n## b) Customer protection\n\n## c) Product design and review risk\n\n## d) Financial crime\n\nProducts and services must meet the needs of clients, customers, markets and the Group throughout their life cycle, However, there is a risk that the design and review of the Group's products and services fail to reasonably consider and address potential or actual negative outcomes, which may result in customer detriment, enforcement action (including regulatory fines and/or sanctions), redress and remediation and reputational damage. Both the design and review of products and services are a key area of focus for regulators and the Group.\n\nThe Group may be adversely affected if it fails to effectively mitigate the risk that third parties or its employees facilitate, or that its products and services are used to facilitate, financial crime (money laundering, terrorist financing, breaches of economic and financial sanctions, bribery and corruption, and the facilitation of tax evasion). UK and US regulations covering financial institutions continue to focus on combating financial crime. Failure to comply may lead to enforcement action by the Group's regulators, including severe penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial condition and prospects.\n\nRegulators around the world continue to emphasise the importance of culture and personal accountability and enforce the adoption of adequate internal reporting and whistleblowing procedures to help to promote appropriate conduct and drive positive outcomes for customers, colleagues, clients and markets. The requirements and expectations of the UK Senior Managers Regime, Certification Regime and Conduct Rules have reinforced additional accountabilities for individuals across the Group with an increased focus on governance and rigour, with similar requirements also introduced in other jurisdictions globally. Failure to meet these requirements and expectations may lead to regulatory sanctions, both for the individuals and the Group.\n\n## e) Regulatory focus on culture and accountability\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to conduct risk, refer to the conduct risk management and conduct risk performance sections.\n\n## viii) Reputation risk\n\nAny material lapse in standards of integrity, compliance, customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputation risk. Stakeholder expectations constantly evolve, and so reputation risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions, groups and individuals. A risk arising in one business area can have an adverse effect upon the Group's overall reputation and any one transaction, investment or event (in the perception of key stakeholders) can reduce trust in the Group's integrity and competence. The Group's association with sensitive topics and sectors has been, and in some instances continues to be, an area of concern for stakeholders, including: (i) the financing of, and investments in, businesses which operate in sectors that are sensitive because of their relative carbon intensity or local environmental impact; (ii) potential association with human rights violations (including combating modern slavery) in the Group's operations or supply chain and by clients and customers; and (iii) the financing of businesses which manufacture and export military and riot control goods and services.\n\nReputation risk is the risk that an action, transaction, investment, event, decision or business relationship will reduce trust in the Group's integrity and/or competence.\n\nReputation risk could also arise from negative public opinion about the actual, or perceived, manner in which the Group (including its employees, clients and other associations) conducts its business activities, or the Group's financial performance, as well as actual or perceived practices in banking and the financial services industry generally. Modern technologies, in particular, online social media channels and other broadcast tools that facilitate communication with large audiences in short time frames and with minimal costs, may significantly enhance and accelerate the distribution and effect of damaging information and allegations. Negative public opinion may adversely affect the Group's ability to retain and attract customers, in particular, corporate and retail depositors, and to retain and motivate staff, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n\nFor further details on the Group's approach to reputation risk, refer to the reputation risk management and reputation risk performance sections.\n\nIn addition to the above, reputation risk has the potential to arise from operational issues or conduct matters which cause detriment to customers, clients, market integrity, effective competition or the Group (refer to 'v) Operational risk' above).",

        "page_content": "## ix) Legal risk and legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nA breach of applicable legislation and/or regulations by the Group or its employees could result in criminal prosecution, regulatory censure, potentially significant fines and other sanctions in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Where clients, customers or other third parties are harmed by the Group's conduct, this may also give rise to civil legal proceedings, including class actions. Other legal disputes may also arise between the Group and third parties relating to matters such as breaches or enforcement of legal rights or obligations arising under contracts, statutes or common law. Adverse findings in any such matters may result in the Group being liable to third parties or may result in the Group's rights not being enforced as intended.\n\nThe Group conducts activities in a highly regulated global market which exposes it and its employees to legal risk arising from: (i) the multitude of laws and regulations that apply to the businesses it operates, which are highly dynamic, may vary between jurisdictions and/or conflict, and are often unclear in their application to particular circumstances especially in new and emerging areas; and (ii) the diversified and evolving nature of the Group's businesses and business practices. In each case, this exposes the Group and its employees to the risk of loss or the imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of members of the Group to meet their respective legal obligations, including legal or contractual requirements. Legal risk may arise in relation to any number of the material existing and emerging risks identified above.\n\nDetails of legal, competition and regulatory matters to which the Group is currently exposed are set out in Note 26. In addition to matters specifically described in Note 26, the Group is engaged in various other legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Group is also subject to requests for information, investigations and other reviews by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with business activities in which the Group is, or has been, engaged and may (from time to time) be subject to legal proceedings and other investigations relating to financial and non-financial disclosures made by members of the Group (including, but not limited to, in relation to ESG disclosures). Additionally,\n\ndue to the increasing number of new climate and sustainability-related laws and regulations (or laws and regulatory processes seeking to protect the energy sector from any risks of divestment or challenges in accessing finance), growing demand from investors and customers for environmentally sustainable products and services, and regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions, including the Group, may through their business activities face increasing litigation, conduct, enforcement and contract liability risks related to climate change, environmental degradation and other social, governance and sustainability-related issues. Furthermore, there is a risk that shareholders, campaign groups, customers and other interest groups could seek to take legal action against the Group for financing or contributing to climate change and environmental degradation.\n\nThe outcome of legal, competition and regulatory matters, both those to which the Group is currently exposed and any others which may arise in the future, is difficult to predict. In connection with such matters, the Group may incur significant expense, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and any such matters could expose the Group to any of the following outcomes: substantial monetary damages, settlements and/or fines; remediation of affected customers and clients; other penalties and injunctive relief; additional litigation; criminal prosecution; the loss of any existing agreed protection from prosecution; regulatory restrictions on the Group's business operations including the withdrawal of authorisations; increased regulatory compliance requirements or changes to laws or regulations; suspension of operations; public reprimands; loss of significant assets or business; a negative effect on the Group's reputation; loss of confidence by investors, counterparties, clients and/or customers; risk of credit rating agency downgrades; potential negative impact on the availability and/or cost of funding and liquidity; and/or dismissal or resignation of key individuals. In light of the uncertainties involved in legal, competition and regulatory matters, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those arising after the date of this Annual Report) will not have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",

Governance Framework: Develop a Principal Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement and integrate climate drivers into limit setting.\n\nGiven the increasing risks associated with climate change, and to support the Group's ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050, it was agreed that climate risk would become a principal risk from 2022. To support this decision, in 2021 the Group delivered a Climate Risk Integration Plan with three overarching objectives:\n\n- 2.   Scenario Analysis: Refine methodologies used for the 2020 scenario analysis to support the Bank of England Biennial Exploratory Scenario on climate change, with specific focus on wholesale credit and physical risk modelling.\n\nFor more detail on how climate risks arise and their impact on the Group, refer to the 'material existing and emerging risks' section.\n\n- 3.   Carbon Modelling: Enhance the BlueTrack TM model to further develop the approach for the Energy sector, expand coverage to Cement and Metals and consider the overall net zero ambition of the Group.\n\n## Organisation and structure\n\nIn 2021 the Head of Climate Risk took the role of Climate Principal Risk owner, reporting directly to the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the BRC reviews and approves the Group's approach to managing the financial and operational risks associated with climate change. Reputation risk is the responsibility of the Board, which directly handles the most material issues facing the Group. Broader sustainability matters and other reputation risk issues associated with climate change are co-ordinated by the Sustainability team.\n\nTo support the oversight of Barclays Group climate risk profile a Climate Risk Committee (CRC) has been established. The CRC is a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee (GRC), the most senior executive body responsible for review and challenge of risk practices and risk profile, for climate risk and other principal risk types. The authority of the CRC is delegated by the GRC. The management of  climate risk is supported by working groups established by Barclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF)\n\nBoard Risk Committee\n\nCredit, market, treasury & capital and operational risks\n\nSustainability matters and reputation risk associated with climate change\n\nGroup Chief Risk Officer\n\nGlobal Head of Public Policy and Corporate Responsibility\n\n## Board",

It establishes a direct link between strategic plans and risk appetite, supporting Barclays' ambition to be a net zero bank by 2050.\n\n## Linking with ESG and Reputation Risk:\n\nA dedicated Sustainability team considers how the Group approaches wider sustainability and environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, working closely with the Environmental Risk Management function.\n\nBarclays has published a Climate Change Statement, which sets out the strategic ambition to support economies and clients through the net zero transition, as well as appetite for conducting business with particularly sensitive energy sub-sectors. It is supported by an internal Climate Change Standard, which outlines the controls and approach to these sectors in more detail, including requirements for enhanced due diligence for restricted activities (such as outlined in the Group Forestry & Palm Oil Standard). These standards are enforced through an existing transaction origination, review and approval process.",

In the entities, business risk committees (attended by the first line) monitor and review the credit risk profile of each business unit where the most material issues are escalated to the Retail Credit Risk Management Committee, Wholesale Credit Risk Management Committee and Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nWholesale and retail portfolios are managed separately to reflect the differing nature of the assets; wholesale balances tend to be larger and are managed on an individual basis, while retail balances are greater in number but lesser in value and are, therefore, managed in aggregated segments.\n\nThe responsibilities of the credit risk management teams in the businesses, the sanctioning team and other shared services include: sanctioning new credit agreements (principally wholesale); setting strategies for approval of transactions (principally retail); setting risk appetite; monitoring risk against limits and other parameters; maintaining robust processes, data gathering, quality, storage and reporting methods for effective credit risk management; performing effective turnaround and workout scenarios for wholesale portfolios via dedicated restructuring and recoveries teams; maintaining robust collections and recovery processes/units for retail portfolios; and review and validation of credit risk measurement models. The credit risk management teams in each legal entity are accountable to the relevant Legal Entity CRO, who reports to the Group CRO.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nFor wholesale portfolios, credit risk managers are organised in sanctioning teams by geography, industry and/or product. In wholesale portfolios, credit risk approval is undertaken by experienced credit risk professionals operating within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, with only the most senior credit officers assigned the higher levels of delegated authority. The largest credit exposures, which are outside the Risk Sanctioning Unit or Risk Distribution Committee authority, require the support of a legal entity Senior Credit Officer. For exposures in excess of the legal entity Senior Credit Officer's authority, approval by Group Senior Credit Officer/Board Risk Committee is also required. The Group Credit Risk Committee, attended by legal entity Senior Credit Officers, provides a formal mechanism for the Group Senior Credit Officer to exercise the highest level of credit authority over the most material Group single name exposures.\n\nThe Group employs a range of techniques and strategies to actively mitigate credit risks. These can broadly be divided into three types:\n\n- \u25a0 collateral\n- \u25a0 netting and set-off\n- \u25a0 risk transfer.\n\n## Netting and set-off\n\n## Collateral\n\nCredit risk exposures can be reduced by applying netting and set-off. For derivative transactions, the Group's normal practice is, on a legal entity basis, to enter into standard master agreements with counterparties (e.g. ISDAs). These master agreements typically allow for netting of credit risk exposure to a counterparty resulting from derivative transactions against the obligations to the counterparty in the event of default, and so produce a lower net credit exposure. These agreements may also reduce settlement exposure (e.g. for foreign exchange transactions) by allowing payments on the same day in the same currency to be set-off against one another.\n\nThe Group has the ability to call on collateral in the event of default of the counterparty, comprising:\n\n- \u25a0 wholesale lending: a fixed charge over commercial property and other physical assets, in various forms\n- \u25a0 home loans: a fixed charge over residential property in the form of houses, flats and other dwellings\n- \u25a0 other retail lending: includes charges over motor vehicles and other physical assets; second lien charges over residential property; and finance lease receivables\n- \u25a0 reverse repurchase agreements: collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which have been legally transferred to the Group subject to an agreement to return them for a fixed price\n- \u25a0 derivatives: the Group also often seeks to enter into a margin agreement (e.g. Credit Support Annex) with counterparties with which the Group has master netting agreements in place. These annexes to master agreements provide a mechanism for further reducing credit risk, whereby collateral (margin) is posted on a regular basis (typically daily) to collateralise the mark to market exposure of a derivative portfolio measured on a net basis\n- \u25a0 financial guarantees and similar offbalance sheet commitments: cash collateral may be held against these arrangements.",

        "page_content": "## Risk transfer\n\n- \u25a0 if the risk is transferred to a counterparty which is more creditworthy than the original counterparty, then overall credit risk is reduced\n\nA range of instruments including guarantees, credit insurance, credit derivatives and securitisation can be used to transfer credit risk from one counterparty to another. These mitigate credit risk in two main ways:\n\n- \u25a0 where recourse to the first counterparty remains, both counterparties must default before a loss materialises. This is less likely than the default of either counterparty individually so credit risk is reduced.\n\nDetailed policies are in place to appropriately recognise and record credit risk mitigation. For more information, refer to pages 177 to 179 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).\n\n## Governance and oversight of ECLs under IFRS 9\n\ni) Impairment policy requirements are set and reviewed regularly, at a minimum annually, to maintain adherence to accounting standards. Key judgements inherent in policy, including the estimated life of revolving credit facilities and the quantitative criteria for assessing the significant increase in credit risk (SICR), are separately supported by analytical study. In particular, the quantitative thresholds used for assessing SICR are subject to a number of internal validation criteria, particularly in retail portfolios where thresholds decrease as the origination Probability of Default (PD) of each facility increases. Key policy requirements are also typically aligned to the Group's credit risk management strategy and practices, for example, wholesale customers that are risk managed on an individual basis are assessed for ECL on an individual basis upon entering Stage 3; furthermore, key internal risk management indicators of high risk are used to set SICR policy, for example, retail customers identified as high risk  account management are automatically deemed to have met the SICR criteria.\n\nThe Group's organisational structure and internal governance processes oversee the estimation of ECL across several areas, including: i) setting requirements in policy, including key assumptions and the application of key judgements; ii) the design and execution of models; and iii) review of ECL results.\n\nii) ECL is estimated in line with internal policy requirements using models which are validated by a qualified independent party to the model development area, the Independent Validation Unit (IVU), before first use and at a minimum annually thereafter. Each model is designated an owner who is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 proposing post-model adjustments (PMA) to address model weaknesses or to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process. All PMAs relating to model deficiencies, regardless of value are approved by IVU for a set time period. PMAs representing Expert Judgement are validated by Risk, as the second line of defence and approved for a set time period. The most material PMAs are also approved by the CRO.\n- \u25a0 model maintenance: monitoring of model performance including backtesting by comparing predicted ECL versus flow into stage 3 and coverage ratios; proposing material changes for independent IVU approval; and recalibrating model parameters on more timely data\n\nModels must also assess ECL across a range of future economic conditions. These economic scenarios are generated via an independent model and ultimately set by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. Economic scenarios are regenerated at a minimum twice annually but more frequently if deemed appropriate, and also to align with the Group's medium term planning exercise. Each model used in the estimation of ECL, including key inputs, are governed by a series of internal controls, which include the validation of completeness and accuracy of data in golden source systems, documented data transformations and documented lineage of data transfers between systems.\n\niii) The Group Impairment Committee, formed of members from both Finance and Risk and attended by both the Group Finance Director and the Group CRO, is responsible for overseeing impairment policy and practice across the Group and will approve impairment results. Reported results and key messages are communicated to the BAC, which has an oversight role and provides challenge of key assumptions, including the basis of the scenarios adopted. Impairment results are then factored into management decision making, including but not limited to, business planning, risk appetite setting and portfolio management.\n\n## Market risk management (audited)\n\nThe risk of loss arising from potential adverse changes in the value of the Group's assets and liabilities from fluctuation in market variables including, but not limited to, interest rates, foreign exchange, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, implied volatilities and asset correlations.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nMarket risk arises primarily as a result of client facilitation in wholesale markets, involving market-making activities, risk management solutions and execution of syndications. Upon execution of a trade with a client, the Group will look to hedge against the risk of the trade moving in an adverse direction. Mismatches between client transactions and hedges result in market risk due to changes in asset prices, volatility or correlations.\n\nMarket risk in the businesses resides primarily in Barclays International and Treasury. These businesses have the mandate to assume market risk. The front office and Treasury trading desks are responsible for managing market risk on a day-to-day basis, where they are required to understand and adhere to all limits applicable to their businesses. The Market Risk team supports the trading desks with the day-to-day limit management of market risk exposures through governance processes which are outlined in supporting market risk policies and standards.\n\nThe objectives of market risk management are to:\n\nMarket risk oversight and challenge is provided by business committees and Group committees, including the Market Risk Committee (MRC).\n\n- \u25a0 identify, understand and control market risk by robust measurement, limit setting, reporting and oversight\n- \u25a0 control market risk in the businesses according to the allocated appetite.\n- \u25a0 facilitate business growth within a controlled and transparent risk management framework\n\nTo meet the above objectives, a governance structure is in place to manage these risks consistent with the ERMF.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Principal risk management continued\n\nThe BRC recommends market risk appetite to the Board for their approval. The Market Risk Principal Risk Lead (PR Lead) is responsible for the Market Risk Control Framework and, under delegated authority from the Group CRO, agrees with the business CROs a limit framework within the context of the approved market risk appetite.\n\nIn addition to MRC, the Corporate and Investment Bank Risk Committee ('CIBRC') is the main forum in which market risk exposures are discussed and reviewed with senior business heads. The Committee is chaired by the CRO of Barclays International and meets weekly, covering current market events, notable market risk exposures, and key risk topics. New business initiatives are generally socialised at CIBRC before any changes to risk appetite or associated limits are considered in other governance committees.\n\nThe MRC reviews and makes recommendations concerning the group-wide market risk profile. This includes overseeing the operation of the Market Risk Framework and associated standards and policies; reviewing market or regulatory issues and limits and utilisation. The committee is chaired by the PR Lead and attendees include the business heads of market risk and business aligned market risk managers.\n\nThe head of each business is accountable for all market risks associated with its activities, while the head of the market risk team covering each business is responsible for implementing the risk control framework for market risk.\n\n## Management value at risk (VaR)\n\nFor more information on market risk management, refer to the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).\n\nVaR is an estimate of the potential loss arising from unfavourable market movements if the current positions were to be held unchanged for one business day. For internal market risk management purposes, a historical simulation methodology with a one-year equally weighted historical period, at the 95% confidence level is used for all trading books and some banking books.\n\nSee the market risk performance section for a review of management VaR.\n\nLimits are applied at the total level as well as by risk factor type, which are then cascaded down to particular trading desks and businesses by the market risk management function.\n\n## Treasury and capital risk management\n\nLiquidity risk: The risk that the Group is unable to meet its contractual or contingent obligations or that it does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to support its assets.\n\n## This comprises:\n\nCapital risk: The risk that the Group has an insufficient level or composition of capital to support its normal business activities and to meet its regulatory capital requirements under normal operating environments and stressed conditions (both actual and as defined for internal planning or regulatory testing purposes). This also includes the risk from the Group's pension plans.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book: The risk that the Group is exposed to capital or income volatility because of a mismatch between the interest rate exposures of its (non-traded) assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Treasury function manages treasury and capital risk exposure on a day-to-day basis with the Group Treasury Committee acting as the principal management body. The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for oversight and provide insight into key capital, liquidity, interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) and pension risk management activities.\n\nThe efficient management of liquidity is essential to the Group in order to retain the confidence of the financial markets and maintain the sustainability of the business. Treasury and Capital Risk have created a framework to manage all liquidity risk exposures under both normal and stressed conditions. The framework is designed to maintain liquidity resources that are sufficient in amount, quality and funding tenor profile to remain within the liquidity risk appetite as expressed by the Barclays PLC Board. The liquidity risk appetite is monitored against both internal and regulatory liquidity metrics.\n\n## Liquidity risk management (audited) Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe framework established by treasury and capital risk is designed to deliver the appropriate term and structure of funding, consistent with the liquidity risk appetite set by the Board. The framework incorporates a range of ongoing business management tools to monitor, limit and stress test the Group's balance sheet, contingent liabilities and the recovery plan. Limit setting and transfer pricing are tools that are designed to control the level of liquidity risk taken and drive the appropriate mix of funds. Together, these tools reduce the likelihood that a liquidity stress event could lead to an inability to meet Group's obligations as they fall due.\n\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for managing liquidity risk within the set risk appetite. Both Risk and Treasury contribute to the production of the Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP). The Treasury and Capital Risk function is responsible for the management and governance of the liquidity risk mandate, as defined by the Board.\n\nThe Board approves the Group funding plan, internal stress tests, regulatory stress test results, recovery plan and liquidity risk appetite. The Group Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity risk in line with the Group's funding management objectives, funding plan and risk appetite. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the liquidity risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of liquidity risk. The Board Risk Committee reviews the risk profile, and reviews liquidity risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group funding plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected funding abilities.\n\nCapital risk is managed through ongoing monitoring and management of the capital position, regular stress testing and a robust capital governance framework. The objectives of the framework are to maintain adequate capital for the Group and legal entities to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and maintain adequate capital to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\n## Capital risk management (audited) Overview",

        "page_content": "## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nCapital risk management is underpinned by a control framework and policy. The capital management strategy, outlined in the Group and legal entity capital plans, is developed in alignment with the control framework and policy for capital risk, and is implemented consistently in order to deliver on the Group's objectives.\n\nTreasury has the primary responsibility for managing and monitoring capital adequacy. The Treasury and Capital Risk function provides oversight of capital risk. Production of the Barclays PLC Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) is the responsibility of Treasury.\n\nThe Board approves the Group capital plan, internal stress tests and results of regulatory stress tests, and the Group recovery plan. The Group Treasury Committee is responsible for monitoring and managing capital risk in line with the Group's capital management objectives, capital plan and risk frameworks. The Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the capital risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of capital risk. The BRC reviews the risk profile, and reviews risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the Group capital plan/forecast in order to agree the Group's projected capital adequacy.\n\n## Pension risk\n\nLocal management assures compliance with an entity's minimum regulatory capital requirements by reporting to local Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs) with oversight by the Group Treasury Committee, as required. In 2021, Barclays complied with all regulatory minimum capital requirements.\n\nThe Group maintains a number of defined benefit pension schemes for past and current employees. The ability of schemes to meet pension payments is achieved with investments and contributions.\n\nPension risk arises because the market value of pension fund assets might decline; investment returns might reduce; or the estimated value of pension liabilities might increase. The Group monitors the pension risks arising from its defined benefit pension schemes and works with the relevant pension fund's trustees to address shortfalls. In these circumstances, the Group could be required or might choose to make extra contributions to the pension fund. The Group's main defined benefit scheme was closed to new entrants in 2012.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book management (IRRBB)\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is driven by customer deposit taking and lending activities, investments in the liquid asset portfolio and funding activities. As per the Group's policy to remain within the defined risk appetite, hedging strategies are executed to mitigate the various IRRBB risks that result from these activities. However, the Group remains susceptible to interest rate risk and other non-traded market risks from the following key sources:\n\n## Overview\n\n- \u25a0 Interest rate and repricing risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by a change in interest rates, differences in the timing of interest rate changes between assets and liabilities, and other constraints on interest rate changes as per product terms and conditions.\n- \u25a0 Investment risks in the liquid asset portfolio: the risk that the fair value of assets held in the liquid asset portfolio and associated risk management portfolios could be adversely impacted by market volatility, creating volatility in capital directly.\n- \u25a0 Customer behavioural risk: the risk that net interest income could be adversely impacted by the discretion that customers and counterparties may have in respect of being able to vary their contractual obligations with Barclays. This risk is often referred to by industry regulators as 'embedded option risk'.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nIn addition, the Group's IRRBB policy sets out the processes and key controls required to identify all IRRBB risks arising from banking book operations, to monitor the risk exposures via a set of metrics with a frequency in line with the risk management horizon, and to manage these risks within agreed risk appetite and limits.\n\nThe entity ALCOs and/or treasury committees, together with the Group Treasury Committee, are responsible for monitoring and managing IRRBB risk in line with the Group's management objectives and risk frameworks. The GRC and Treasury and Capital Risk Committee monitors and reviews the IRRBB risk profile and control environment, providing second line oversight of the management of IRRBB. The BRC reviews the interest rate risk profile, including  review of the risk appetite at least annually and the impact of stress scenarios on the interest rate risk of the Group's banking books.\n\n## Operational risk management\n\nThe risk of loss to the Group from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or due to external events (for example, fraud) where the root cause is not due to credit or market risks.\n\n## Overview\n\n- \u25a0 deliver an operational risk capability owned and used by business leaders to enable sound risk decisions over the long term\n\nThe management of operational risk has three key objectives:\n\n- \u25a0 provide the frameworks, policies and standards to enable management to meet their risk management responsibilities while the second line of defence provides robust, independent, and effective oversight and challenge\n\nThe Group operates within a system of internal controls that enables business to be transacted and risk taken without exposing it to unacceptable potential losses or reputational damages.\n\n- \u25a0 deliver a consistent and aggregated measurement of operational risk that will provide clear and relevant insights, so that the right management actions can be taken to keep the operational risk profile consistent with the Group's strategy, the stated risk appetite and stakeholder needs.\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe prime responsibility for the management of operational risk and the compliance with control requirements rests within the business and functional units where the risk arises. The operational risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. Operational risk issues escalated from these meetings are considered through the second line of defence review meetings. Depending on their nature, the outputs of these meetings are presented to the Operational Risk Profile Forum, the Operational Risk Committee, the BRC or the BAC. In addition, specific reports are prepared by Operational Risk on a regular basis for the GRC and the BRC.",

This includes the risk of failing to: adhere to prudential regulatory requirements; provide regulatory submissions; or monitor and manage adherence to new prudential regulatory requirements.\n\nOperational risks are grouped into risk categories to support effective risk management, measurement and reporting. These comprise: Data Management Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk; Operational Resilience Planning Risk; Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Premises Risk; Physical Security Risk; Strategic Investment Change Management Risk; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk; and Transaction Operations Risk.\n\n## Risk themes\n\nFor definitions of the Group's operational risk categories and risk themes, refer to the management of operational risk section in the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021.\n\nBarclays also recognises that there are certain threats/risk drivers that are more thematic and have the potential to impact the Group's strategic objectives. These are risk themes which require an overarching and integrated risk management approach. The Group's risk themes include Cyber, Data, and Resilience.\n\n## Model risk management\n\nThe potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Group uses models to support a broad range of activities, including informing business decisions and strategies, measuring and limiting risk, valuing exposures, conducting stress testing, assessing capital adequacy, managing client assets, and meeting reporting requirements.\n\nThe Group has a dedicated Model Risk Management (MRM) function that consists of four teams: (i) Independent Validation Unit (IVU), responsible for model validation and approval; (ii) Model Governance  (MG), responsible for model risk governance, controls and reporting, including ownership of the Model Risk Framework, the Group Model Risk Policy and the associated standards;  (iii) Strategy and Transformation responsible for inventory, strategy, communications and business management; and (iv) Model Risk Measurement and Quantification (MRMQ), responsible for the design of the framework and methodology to measure and, where possible,  quantify model risk. It is also responsible for the strategic Validation Centre of Excellence (VCoE), which is an independent quality assurance function within MRM with the mandate to review and challenge validation outcomes.\n\nThe model risk management framework consists of the model risk policy and standards. The policy prescribes Group-wide, end-to-end requirements for the identification, measurement and management of model risk, covering model documentation, development, monitoring, annual review, independent validation and approval, change and reporting processes. The policy is supported by global standards covering model inventory, documentation, validation, complexity and materiality, testing and monitoring, overlays, risk appetite, as well as vendor models and stress testing challenger models.\n\nThe key model risk management activities include:\n\nThe function reports to the Group CRO and operates a global framework. Implementation of best practice standards is a central objective of the Group.\n\n- \u25a0 Correctly identifying models across all relevant areas of the Group, and recording models in the Group Models Database (GMD), the Group-wide model inventory.\n- \u25a0 Overseeing that every model is subject to validation and approval by IVU, prior to being used and on a continual basis.\n- \u25a0 Enforcing that every model has a model owner who is accountable for the model. The model owner must sign off models prior to submission to IVU for validation and maintain that the model presented to IVU is and remains fit for purpose.\n- \u25a0 Defining model risk appetite in terms of risk tolerance, and qualitative metrics which are used to track and report model risk.",

The RRMF sets out what is required to manage reputation risk across the Group.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group are required to operate within established reputation risk appetite, and their component businesses prepare reports highlighting their most significant current and potential reputation risks and issues and how they are being managed. These reports are a key internal source of information for the quarterly reputation risk reports which are prepared for Barclays Group ExCo and the Board.\n\nThe Group Reputation Risk Committee is a sub-committee of the Group Executive Committee, authorised to manage material reputation risks and issues as they are brought to the attention of the committee via relevant reputation risk assessment and escalation processes.\n\n## Legal Risk management\n\nThe risk of loss or imposition of penalties, damages or fines from the failure of the Group to meet its legal obligations, including regulatory or contractual requirements.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Organisation, roles and responsibilities\n\nThe Group has no tolerance for wilful breaches of laws, regulations or other legal obligations. However, the multitude of laws and regulations across the globe are highly dynamic and their application to particular circumstances is often unclear. This results in a high level of inherent legal risk which the Group seeks to mitigate through the operation of a Group-wide legal risk management framework, including the implementation of Group-wide legal risk policies requiring the engagement of legal professionals in situations that have the potential for legal risk. Notwithstanding these mitigating actions, the Group operates with a level of residual legal risk, for which the Group has limited tolerance.\n\nThe Group's businesses and functions have primary responsibility for identifying and escalating legal risk in their area as well as responsibility for adherence to minimum control requirements.\n\nThe Group General Counsel is responsible for developing and maintaining a Group-wide legal risk management framework. This includes defining the relevant legal risk policies, developing Group-wide risk appetite for legal risk, and oversight of the implementation of controls to manage and escalate legal risk.\n\nThe Legal Function organisation and coverage model aligns legal expertise to businesses, functions, products, activities and geographic locations so that the Group receives support from appropriate legal professionals, working in partnership to manage legal risk. The senior management of the Legal Function oversees, challenges and monitors the legal risk profile and effectiveness of the legal risk control environment across the Group. The Legal Function does not sit in any of the Three Lines of Defence but supports them all.\n\nThe legal risk profile and control environment is reviewed by management through business risk committees and control committees. The Group Risk Committee is the most senior executive body responsible for reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management across the Group. Escalation paths from this committee exist to the Barclays PLC Board Risk Committee.",

Customer and client default rates have remained relatively stable despite the impact of the pandemic and volatile macroeconomic environment.\n\nCredit risk disclosures include many of the recommendations of the Taskforce on Disclosures about Expected Credit Losses (DECL) and it is expected that relevant disclosures will continue to be developed in future periods.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nRefer to the credit risk management section for details of governance, policies and procedures.\n\nCredit impairment release of \u00a3(653)m  (2020: \u00a34,838m charge) due to the improved macroeconomics outlook and reduced unsecured lending balances and low delinquency. Economic uncertainty adjustments have been maintained in respect of customers and clients considered to be potentially more vulnerable as government and other support schemes have started to reduce.\n\nIn retail cards, credit profiles did not show material deterioration due to continued government support measures in some geographies  and customer deleveraging. In wholesale, watch list balances continue to improve. However, the degree of economic uncertainty remains relatively high: credit deterioration may still occur when support measures are fully withdrawn across geographies; emerging supply chain disruption and inflationary pressures may challenge economic stability. Given this backdrop, management has maintained economic uncertainty  adjustments to modelled outputs to address these sources of uncertainties and ensure that the potential impact of stress are provided for. This uncertainty continues to be captured in two distinct ways: firstly, the identification of customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to the withdrawal of support and emerging economic instability and secondly, model uncertainty which does not capture certain macroeconomic and risk parameter uncertainties which are applied at a portfolio level. Refer to the Management adjustment\n\n## Maximum exposure and effects of netting, collateral and risk transfer\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation between the Group's maximum exposure and its net exposure to credit risk, reflecting the financial effects of risk mitigation reducing the Group's exposure.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, maximum exposure to credit risk represents the balance sheet carrying value after allowance for impairment. For off-balance sheet guarantees, the maximum exposure is the maximum amount that the Group would have to pay if the guarantees were to be called upon. For loan commitments and other credit related commitments that are irrevocable over the life of the respective facilities, the maximum exposure is the full amount of the committed facilities.\n\nThe Group mitigates the credit risk to which it is exposed through netting and set-off, collateral and risk transfer. Further detail on the Group's policies to each of these forms of credit\n\nThis and subsequent analyses of credit risk exclude other financial assets not subject to credit risk, mainly equity securities. For off-balance sheet exposures certain contingent liabilities not subject to credit risk such as performance guarantees are excluded.\n\nto models for impairment section on page 237 for further details.\n\n## Key metrics\n\nFurther detail can be found in the Financial statements section in Note 7 Credit impairment charges. Descriptions of terminology can be found in the glossary, available at home.barclays/annualreport.\n\nDecrease in impairment allowances of\n\nImpairment allowances on loans and advances at amortised cost including off-balance sheet elements of the allowance, decreased by \u00a33,115m to \u00a36,284m (2020: \u00a39,399m). The decrease is driven by Barclays International \u00a31,801m, Barclays UK \u00a31,252m, and Head Office \u00a362m. Refer to the Expected Credit Losses section for further details.\n\n## \u00a33,115m\n\nenhancement is presented on pages 177 to 179 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group's net exposure to credit risk, after taking into account credit risk mitigation, increased 4% to \u00a3912bn (2020: \u00a3877bn). Overall, the extent to which the Group holds mitigation against its total exposure slightly decreased to 44% (2020: 46%).\n\n## Overview\n\nOf the unmitigated on balance sheet exposure, a significant portion relates to cash held at central banks, cash collateral and settlement balances, and debt securities issued by governments all of which are considered to be lower risk. The increase in the Group's net exposure to credit risk is mainly driven by increases in cash held at central banks and off-balance sheet loan commitments. Trading portfolio liability positions, which to a significant extent economically hedge trading portfolio assets but which are not held specifically for risk management purposes, are excluded from the analysis. The credit quality of counterparties to derivatives, financial investments and wholesale loan assets are predominantly investment grade. Further analysis on the credit quality of assets is presented in the approach to management and representation of credit quality section.",

Also included are off-balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts by gross exposure and impairment allowance and coverage ratio by stage allocation as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost by stage\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately.

The reduction in provisions is informed by the improved macroeconomic outlook over the course of 2021, partially offset by management judgements to reflect the risk of uncertainty still prevailing within these sectors. The wholesale portfolio also benefits from a hedge protection programme that enables effective risk management against systemic losses. An additional \u00a30.1bn (2020: \u00a30.1bn) impairment allowance has been applied to the undrawn exposures not included in the table below.\n\nThe table below presents a breakdown of drawn exposure and impairment allowance for loans and advances at amortised cost , with stage allocation for selected industry sectors within the wholesale loans portfolio. The industry sectors have been selected based upon the level of management focus they have received following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The credit risk industry concentration disclosure in the analysis of the concentration of credit risk section represents all the industry categories and the below only covers a subset of that

Barclays continually review the output of models to determine accuracy of the ECL calculation including review of model monitoring, external benchmarking and experience of model operation over an extended period of time. This ensures that the models used continue to reflect the risks inherent across the businesses.\n- a Business activity in the year does not include additional drawdowns on the existing facility which are reported under 'Net drawdowns, repayments, net re-measurement and movements due to exposure and risk parameter changes'.\n- c The \u00a31.9bn disposals reported within Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending portfolio includes \u00a31.7bn sale of motor financing business within the Barclays Partner Finance business and \u00a30.2bn relate to debt sales undertaken during the year. The \u00a32.4bn disposal reported within Wholesale loans include sale of debt securities as part of the Group Treasury operations.\n- d   In 2020, gross write-offs amounted to \u00a31,964m (2019: \u00a31,883m) and post write-off recoveries amounted to \u00a335m (2019: \u00a3124m). Net write-offs represent gross write-offs less post write-off recoveries and amounted to \u00a31,929m (2019: \u00a31,759m).",

The reclassification followed a review of back-testing of results which indicated that origination probability of default characteristics were unnecessarily moving Stage 1 accounts into Stage 2.\n\n|                                                                            | Reconciliation of ECL movement to credit impairment charge/(release) for the period \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Home loans                                                                 | 128                                                                                      |\n| Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending                     | 2,597                                                                                    |\n| Wholesale loans                                                            | 1,438                                                                                    |\n| ECL movement excluding assets derecognised due to disposals and write-offs | 4,163                                                                                    |\n| Recoveries and reimbursements a                                            | (399)                                                                                    |\n| Exchange and other adjustments b                                           | 145                                                                                      |\n| Credit impairment charge on loan commitments and financial guarantees      | 776                                                                                      |\n| Credit impairment charge on other financial assets c                       | 153                                                                                      |\n| Credit impairment charge for the year                                      | 4,838                                                                                    |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Includes foreign exchange and interest and fees in suspense.\n- a Recoveries and reimbursements includes \u00a3364m for reimbursements expected to be received under the arrangement where Group has entered into financial guarantee contracts which provide credit protection over certain loan assets with third parties.

This is augmented by inclusion of accounts meeting the designated high risk criteria (including watchlist) for the portfolio under the qualitative test. Qualitative tests predominantly include \u00a38.3bn (2020: \u00a38.5bn) in Barclays UK of which \u00a36.8bn (2020: \u00a37.1bn) relates to UK Home Finance, \u00a31.0bn (2020: \u00a31.0bn) relates to Business Banking and \u00a30.2bn (2020: \u00a30.1bn) relates to Barclaycard UK. A further \u00a32.6bn (2020: \u00a33.3bn) relates to Barclays International of which \u00a31.4bn (2020: \u00a32.0bn) relates to Corporate and Investment Bank and \u00a31.1bn (2020: \u00a31.0bn) relates to Consumer, Cards and Payments.\n\n- a Where balances satisfy more than one of the above three criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk, the corresponding gross exposure and ECL has been assigned in order of categories presented.\n\nA small number of other accounts (2% of impairment allowances and 3% of gross exposure) are included in Stage 2. These accounts are not otherwise identified by the quantitative or qualitative tests but are more than 30 days past due. The percentage triggered by these backstop criteria is a measure of the effectiveness of the Stage 2 criteria in identifying deterioration prior to delinquency. These balances include items in the Corporate and Investment Bank for reasons such as outstanding interest and fees rather than principal balances.\n\n## Stage 3 decomposition\n\nFor further detail on the three criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk required for Stage 2 classification, refer to Note 7.\n\nLoans and advances at amortised cost\n\n|                                                          | 2021           | 2021                  | 2020           | 2020                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                          | Gross exposure | Impairment  allowance | Gross exposure | Impairment  allowance |\n| As at 31 December                                        | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m                    | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m                    |\n| Exposures not charged-off including within cure period a | 3,894          | 657                   | 3,773          | 831                   |\n| Exposures individually assessed or in recovery book b    | 3,341          | 1,864                 | 5,224          | 2,907                 |\n| Total Stage 3                                            | 7,235          | 2,521                 | 8,997          | 3,738                 |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Exposures individually assessed or in recovery book cannot cure out of Stage 3.\n- a Includes \u00a32.9bn (2020: \u00a32.6bn) of gross exposure in a cure period that must remain in Stage 3 for a minimum of 12 months before moving to Stage 2.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review: Credit risk\n\n## Risk performance continued\n\n## Economic uncertainty adjustments\n\nGiven this backdrop, management has recognised economic uncertainty adjustments to modelled outputs to address these sources of uncertainties and ensure that the potential impacts of stress are provided for. This uncertainty continues to be captured in two distinct ways. Firstly, customer uncertainty:  the identification of customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to the withdrawal of support schemes and emerging economic instability; and secondly, model uncertainty: to capture the impact from model limitations and sensitivities to specific macroeconomic parameters which are applied at a portfolio level.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, macroeconomic forecasts anticipated lasting impacts to unemployment levels and customer and client stress. More recent macroeconomic forecasts indicated that the outlook has improved, with measures of government and bank support having tapered down and no material deterioration in customer delinquencies observed to date. However, the degree of economic uncertainty remains relatively high: credit deterioration may still occur when support measures are fully withdrawn across geographies; emerging supply chain disruption and inflationary pressures may challenge economic stability; and economic consensus may not capture the range of economic uncertainty associated with fast moving new COVID-19 variants such as Omicron.\n\nThe economic uncertainty adjustments of \u00a31.7bn (2020: \u00a32.1bn) includes customer and client uncertainty provisions of \u00a31.5bn (2020: \u00a31.7bn) and model uncertainty provisions of \u00a30.2bn (2020: \u00a30.4bn).\n\n- a.   An adjustment of \u00a30.4bn (2020: \u00a30.7bn) to adjust the probability of default (PDs) to pre-COVID-19 levels to offset the temporary improvement to PDs in light of reduced customer spend behaviour and support measures. The decrease of \u00a30.3bn is primarily driven by some normalisation of customer spending behaviour during the year resulting in a partial release of the PMA.\n\n## Customer uncertainty provisions comprises:\n\n- b.   A vulnerable customer adjustment of \u00a31.1bn (2020: \u00a31.0bn) has been applied to customers and clients considered potentially vulnerable to the withdrawal of support schemes and emerging economic instability against which lifetime coverage is applied. This is split between credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending of \u00a30.8bn (2020: \u00a30.8bn) and wholesale loans of \u00a30.3bn (2020: \u00a30.2bn). The latter includes an adjustment of \u00a30.1bn (2020: nil) to reflect possible cross default risk on Barclays lending in respect of clients who have taken bounce back loans.\n\n## Other adjustments\n\nModel uncertainty provisions reduced by \u00a30.2bn reflecting an update in adjustment in response to the modelled provisions following the update in the Q421 scenarios.\n\nOther adjustments are operational in nature and are expected to remain in place until they can be corrected in the underlying models. These adjustments result from data limitations and model performance related issues identified through established governance processes. The quantum of adjustments reduced in response to the Q421 scenarios  as well as model enhancements made during the year. Material adjustments consists of the following:\n\nCredit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: Includes an adjustment for model inaccuracies informed by model monitoring and a reclassification of loans and advances from Stage 2 to Stage 1 in credit cards. The reclassification followed a review of back-testing results which indicated that accuracy of origination probability of default characteristics require management adjustments to correct and was first established in Q220. This adjustment has reduced driven by the improved macroeconomic scenarios in Q421 and the reduction in exposure on this portfolio.\n\nHome loans: The low average LTV nature of the UK Home Loans portfolio means that modelled ECL estimates are low and do not reflect the tail risk with severe economic stress. An adjustment is made to maintain an appropriate level of ECL informed by model monitoring.\n\nWholesale loans: Materially comprises of an adjustment applied on bounce back loans of \u00a3(0.4)bn to reverse out the modelled charge which does not consider the government guarantee when calculating the ECL.\n\nManagement adjustments of \u00a3(0.4)bn within wholesale loans in 2020 primarily comprised an adjustment to offset modelled ECL output in the Investment Bank to limit excessive ECL sensitivity to the macroeconomic variable for Federal Tax Receipts.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis\n\nThe measurement of modelled ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of probabilities of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives, estimation of exposures at default (EAD) and assessing significant increases in credit risk. The Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), which forms the Baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a broadly similar severity to Barclays' internal stress tests and stress scenarios provided by regulators whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. The favourable scenarios are designed to reflect plausible upside risks to the Baseline scenario which are broadly consistent with the economic narrative approved by the Senior Scenario Review Committee. All scenarios are regenerated at a minimum semi-annually. The scenarios include eight key economic variables (GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets), and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.\n\nManagement has applied economic uncertainty and other adjustments to modelled ECL outputs. Economic uncertainty adjustments reflect the potential vulnerability of specific customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to the full withdrawal of support and emerging economic instability and the degree to which economic consensus may not have captured the range of economic uncertainty associated with new variants of COVID-19.  As a result, ECL is higher than would be the case if it were based on forecast economic scenarios alone.\n\nScenarios used to calculate the Group's ECL charge were reviewed and updated regularly throughout 2021, following the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the year, including the emergence of the Omicron variant and the global vaccination rollout. The current Baseline scenario reflects the latest consensus economic forecasts; the steady recovery in GDP in both the UK and US continues with UK GDP returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels by Q222. UK unemployment peaks at 5.0% in Q122 and US unemployment continues to decline. In the Downside 2 scenario, inflation continues to accelerate and the UK bank rate is increased to 4.0% and the US federal funds rate is increased to 3.5%, by the end of 2022, leading to a further downturn in GDP until Q323. Unemployment peaks in Q323 at 9.2% in the UK and 9.5% in the US.  In the Upside 2 scenario, inflation expectations and global energy prices stabilise and GDP growth rises as COVID-19 risks continue to decline helping to release more of the pent-up demand and accumulated household savings into the economy. Unemployment rates decline gradually.\n\nThe changes to the scenario weights in 2021 primarily reflect changes made to the severity of the scenarios. The Downside 2 scenario has been aligned with the internal stress test, which is informed by a weaker GDP outlook. The effect of this is to move the Downside 2 scenario further away from the Baseline, resulting in a lower weighting. For further details see page 242.\n\nThe methodology for estimating probability weights used in calculating ECL involves simulating a range of future paths for UK and US GDP using historical data. The five scenarios are mapped against the distribution of these future paths, with the median centred around the Baseline such that scenarios further from the Baseline attract a lower weighting. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for Barclays' internal planning purposes. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic outlook has improved, the level of uncertainty remains relatively high. A key judgement is the extent to which economic uncertainty experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic now reflects additional challenges, namely inflationary pressures and global supply chain disruptions. Inflationary headwinds have yet to materially impact customer affordability and corporate profitability data. A balanced approach has therefore been adopted in the sizing of expert judgements as we move away from a period characterised by significant customer support.\n\nThe tables below show the key macroeconomic variables used in the five scenarios (5 year annual paths), the probability weights applied to each scenario and the macroeconomic variables by scenario using 'specific bases' i.e. the most extreme position of each variable in the context of the scenario, for example, the highest unemployment for downside scenarios and the lowest unemployment for upside scenarios. 5-year average tables and movement over time graphs provide additional transparency. Annual paths show quarterly averages for the year (unemployment and base rate) or change in the year (GDP and HPI).\n\nThe economic uncertainty adjustments of \u00a31.7bn (2021: \u00a32.1bn) have been applied as overlays to the modelled ECL output. These adjustments consist of a customer and client uncertainty provision of \u00a31.5bn (2021: \u00a31.7bn) and a model uncertainty provision of \u00a30.2bn (2021: \u00a30.4bn).

Non-modelled exposures and management adjustments are excluded. For information on management adjustments, please see pages 237 to 238.\n\nThe table below shows the ECL assuming scenarios have been 100% weighted. Model exposures are allocated to a stage based on the individual scenario rather than through a probability-weighted approach as required for Barclays reported impairment allowances. As a result, it is not possible to back solve to the final reported weighted ECL from the individual scenarios as a balance may be assigned to a different stage dependent on the scenario. Model exposure uses exposure at default (EAD) values and is not directly comparable to gross exposure used in prior disclosures. For Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending, an average EAD measure is used (12-month or lifetime, depending on stage allocation in each scenario). Therefore, the model exposure movement into Stage 2 is higher than the corresponding Stage 1 reduction.\n\nModel exposures allocated to Stage 3 do not change in any of the scenarios as the transition criteria relies only on observable evidence of default as at 31 December 2021 and not on macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe Downside 2 scenario represents a severe global recession with substantial falls in both UK and US GDP. Unemployment in UK markets rises towards 9.2% and US markets rises towards 9.5% and there are substantial falls in asset prices including housing. Under the Downside 2 scenario, model exposure moves between stages as the economic environment weakens. This can be seen in the movement of \u00a323.6bn of model exposure into Stage 2 between the Weighted and Downside 2 scenario. ECL increases in Stage 2 predominantly due to unsecured portfolios as economic conditions deteriorate.\n\ncla\n\ny",

The disclosure highlights the results of the alternative scenarios enabling the reader to understand the extent of the impact on exposure and ECL from the upside/downside scenarios. Consequently, the use of five scenarios with associated weightings results in a total weighted ECL uplift from the Baseline ECL of 3.9%, largely driven by credit card losses which have more linear loss profiles than UK home loans and wholesale loan positions.\n\na Includes \u00a31.5bn of post model adjustments, of which \u00a30.2bn is included as part of total model ECL and \u00a30.2bn ECL from non-modelled exposures.\n\nHome loans: Total weighted ECL of \u00a3322m represents a 2.5% increase over the Baseline ECL (\u00a3314m), and coverage ratios remain steady across the Upside scenarios, Baseline and Downside 1 scenario. However, total ECL increases in the Downside 2 scenario to \u00a3407m, driven by a significant fall in UK HPI (29.9%) reflecting the non-linearity of the UK portfolio.\n\nWholesale loans: Total weighted ECL of \u00a31,185m represents a 4.2% increase over the Baseline ECL (\u00a31,137m) reflecting the range of economic scenarios used, with exposures in the Investment Bank particularly sensitive to the Downside 2 scenario.\n\nCredit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending: Total weighted ECL of \u00a32,693m represents a 3.9% increase over the Baseline ECL (\u00a32,592m) reflecting the range of economic scenarios used, mainly impacted by Unemployment and other key retail variables. Total ECL increases to \u00a35,010m under the Downside 2 scenario, mainly driven by Stage 2, where coverage rates increase to 23.1% from a weighted scenario approach of 15.5% and circa \u00a37.1bn increase in model exposure that meets the Significant Increase in Credit Risk criteria and transitions from Stage 1 to Stage 2.",

The Group implements limits on concentrations in order to mitigate the risk.

At the lower end of this grade there are customers that are being more carefully monitored, for example, corporate customers which are indicating some evidence of deterioration, home loans with a high loan to value, and unsecured retail loans operating outside normal product guidelines.\n\nLoans that are past due are monitored closely, with impairment allowances raised as appropriate and in line with the Group's impairment policies.\n\nHigher risk: there is concern over the obligor's ability to make payments when due. However, these have not yet converted to actual delinquency. There may also be doubts over the value of collateral or security provided. However, the borrower or counterparty is continuing to make payments when due and is expected to settle all outstanding amounts of principal and interest.\n\n## Debt securities\n\n## Balance sheet credit quality\n\nFor assets held at fair value, the carrying value on the balance sheet will include, among other things, the credit risk of the issuer. Most listed and some unlisted securities are rated by external rating agencies. The Group mainly uses external credit ratings provided by Standard & Poor's, Fitch or Moody's. Where such ratings are not available or are not current, the Group will use its own internal ratings for the securities.\n\nThe following tables present the credit quality of the Group's assets exposed to credit risk.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the ratio of the Group's on-balance sheet assets classified as strong (0.0 to <0.60%) remained stable at 87% (2020: 87%) of total assets exposed to credit risk. Further analysis of debt securities by issuer and issuer type and netting and collateral arrangements on derivative financial instruments is presented in the Analysis of debt securities section and Analysis of derivatives section.\n\n## Overview",

There is therefore no direct relationship between credit quality and IFRS 9 stage classification.\n\n|                        |                        |                        | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Gross carrying amount   | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Allowance for ECL      | Net                    | Coverage               |\n|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                        | PD range               | Credit quality         | Stage 1                 | Stage 2                 | Stage 3                 | Total                   | Stage 1                | Stage 2                | Stage 3                | Total                  | exposure               | ratio                  |\n| Grading                | %                      | description            | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                      | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | %                      |\n| As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021  | As at 31 December 2021  | As at 31 December 2021  | As at 31 December 2021  | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 | As at 31 December 2021 |\n| 1 -

Barclays maintained its share of the market, supported by re-introduction of HLTV (> 85% LTV) products and reversal of some policy tightening introduced in 2020.\n\nHead Office: Italian home loans and advances at amortised cost reduced to \u00a34.7bn (2020: \u00a35.7bn) and continue to run-off since new bookings ceased in 2016. The portfolio is secured on residential property with an average balance weighted mark to market LTV of 60.4% (2020: 62.1%). 90-day arrears decreased to 1.3% (2020: 1.7%) and gross charge-off rate decreased to 0.3% (2020: 1.0%) due to continuous reduction of delinquent balances.\n\n## Credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending\n\nThe principal portfolios listed below accounted for 82% (2020: 84%) of the Group's total credit cards, unsecured loans and other retail lending.\n\n| Credit cards and unsecured loans principal portfolios   | Credit cards and unsecured loans principal

Whilst performance had been on an improving trend as a result of reduced spend and increased repayments due to government support as a response to COVID-19 and lower flows into delinquency, the main driver was a change in the point of charge off from 180 days to 120 days past due. Higher write offs primarily reflected a higher level of debt sales.\n\nBarclays Partner Finance: 30 and 90 day arrears rates both reduced by 0.1% as a result of slightly lower entry rates and flows through the delinquency cycles.\n\nUK personal loans: 30 and 90 day arrears rates reduced significantly to 1.5% (2020: 2.3%) and 0.7% (2020: 1.2%) respectively, with balances reducing by \u00a30.6bn. Similar to UK cards, the main driver was a change in the point of charge off from 180 days to 120 days past due. Higher write offs primarily reflected a higher level of debt sales.\n\nUS cards: 30 and 90 day arrears rates improved and remain below pre-pandemic levels due to continued benefit from government support schemes throughout the pandemic and industry payment deferrals that were made available to consumers.\n\n## Government supported loans\n\nGermany consumer lending: 30 and 90 day arrears rates reduced in 2021 due to improved payment behaviour of formerly high-risk customers as unemployment eased, and the benefit from government support in the local market continued.\n\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic Barclays has supported its customers and clients by participating in the UK Government's Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLs), Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILs), Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILs) and the Recovery Loan Scheme (RLS).\n\n|                        | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Gross exposure   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance   | Impairment allowance                     | Impairment coverage         |                              | Government  guaranteed  exposure   |\n|------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                        | Stage 1          | Stage 2          | Stage 3          | Total            | Modelled  impairment   | Management  adjustment | Impairment  post  management  adjustment | Pre  management  adjustment | Post  management  adjustment | Total                              |\n|                        | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                                       | %                           | %                            | \u00a3m                                 |\n| As at 31 December 2021 |                  |                  |                  |                  |                        |                        |                                          |                             |                              |                                    |\n| Barclays UK            |                  |                  |                  |                  |                        |                        |                                          |                             |                              |                                    |\n| BBLs                   | 7,881            | 797              | 704              | 9,382            | 396                    | (380)                  | 16                                       | 4.2                         | 0.2                          | 9,366                              |\n| CBILs                  | 900              | 110              | 47               | 1,057            | 12                     | (7)                    | 5                                        | 1.1                         | 0.5                          | 845                                |\n| RLSs                   | 11               | -

The RLS aims to help UK businesses access finance as they recover and grow following the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans are guaranteed by the Government at 100% for BBLs and 80% for CBILs, CLBILs and RLS as at the balance sheet date.\n\nAdditionally, while the government supported loans are covered by guarantees, many BBLs customers have other financing arrangements with Barclays which are not covered by the government guarantee. Noting the elevated levels of delinquency across the BBLs population, Barclays has applied an adjustment of \u00a30.1bn to the \u00a32.5bn gross exposure to BBLs customers outside the scheme.\n\nManagement adjustments of \u00a3(380)m and \u00a3(7)m are applied as the underlying ECL models do not currently fully recognise the 100% and 80% government guarantee against BBLs and CBILs exposure within BUK Business Banking. In instances where Barclays has assessed the BBLs exposure to have not met strict assessment criteria, no claim has been made against the government guarantee resulting in an impairment allowance against these loans of \u00a316m at the year-end.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Impairment allowances reduced to \u00a3409m (2020: \u00a3707m) with balance reductions driving lower ECL, a range of cases returning from forbearance and one notable write off. Barclays International accounted for 76% of wholesale forbearance with corporate cases representing 84% of these balances.\n\nForbearance on the Group's principal retail portfolios is presented below. The principal portfolios account for 99% (2020: 100%) of total retail forbearance balances.",

Similarly, derivative liabilities would be \u00a3(235)bn (2020: \u00a3(276)bn) lower reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed. In addition, non-cash collateral of \u00a36bn (2020: \u00a35bn) was held in respect of derivative assets. The Group received collateral from clients in support of over the counter derivative transactions. These transactions are generally undertaken under International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements governed by either UK or New York law.\n\n## Derivatives by collateral arrangement\n\nThe table below sets out the fair value and notional amounts of OTC derivative instruments by type of collateral arrangement.\n\n|                                            | Notional contract   | Fair value   | Fair value   | Notional contract   | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                            | amount              | Assets       | Liabilities  | amount              | Assets       | Liabilities  |\n|                                            | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m           | \u00a3m           | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m           | \u00a3m           |\n| Unilateral in favour of Barclays           |                     |              |              |                     |              |              |\n| Foreign exchange                           | 26,905              | 437          | (635)        | 28,431              | 618          | (532)        |\n| Interest rate                              | 6,790               | 816          | (6)          | 6,580               | 982          | (10)         |\n| Credit derivatives                         | 1,200               | 24           | (202)        | 227                 | 2            | -

The market risk management section provides a description of management VaR.\n\n## Measures of market risk in the Group and accounting measures\n\n- \u25a0 balance sheet measures show accrualsbased balances or marked to market values as at the reporting date;\n\nTraded market risk measures such as VaR and balance sheet exposure measures have fundamental differences:\n\n- \u25a0 VaR measures also take account of current marked to market values, but in addition hedging effects between positions are considered;\n\nFor these reasons, it is not possible to present direct reconciliations of traded market risk and accounting measures.\n\n- \u25a0 market risk measures are expressed in terms of changes in value or volatilities as opposed to static values.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nAverage management VaR decreased by 41% to \u00a319m in 2021 (2020: \u00a332m), driven by reduced risk taking, lower market volatility and the impact of a methodology update in March 2021 which changed the historical lookback period of the VaR model from two years to one year. The methodology change has increased the responsiveness of the model to changes over time in volatility levels in the lookback period.\n\n## Traded market risk review\n\nThe following disclosures provide details on management measures of market risk. Refer to the market risk management section of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited) for more detail on management measures and the differences when compared to regulatory measures.\n\n## Review of management measures\n\nThe table below shows the total management VaR on a diversified basis by risk factor. Total management VaR includes all trading positions in CIB and Treasury and it is calculated with a one-day holding period.\n\nLimits are applied against each risk factor VaR as well as total management VaR, which are then cascaded further by risk managers to each business.",

Historical correlations between losses are taken into account in making these assessments. The high and low VaR figures reported for each category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported as a whole. Consequently, a diversification effect balance for the high and low VaR figures would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the above table.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business scenario stresses\n\nIn 2021, the scenario analyses showed that the largest market risk related impacts would be due to a severe deterioration in financial liquidity and an associated global recession.\n\nAs part of the Group's risk management framework, on a regular basis the performance of the trading business in hypothetical scenarios characterised by severe macroeconomic conditions is modelled. Up to seven global scenarios are modelled on a regular basis, for example, a sharp deterioration in liquidity, a slowdown in the global economy, global recession, and a sharp increase in economic growth.\n\ncla\n\ny",

The Liquidity Framework is delivered via a combination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.\n\nFor further detail on liquidity risk governance and framework, refer to page195 to 200 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's: (i) summary of performance, (ii) liquidity risk stress testing, iii) liquidity pool, (iv) funding structure and funding relationships, (v) credit ratings, and (vi) contractual maturity of financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Key metrics\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio 168%\n\n## Summary of performance\n\nDuring the year, the Group issued \u00a311bn of minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) instruments in a range of tenors and currencies.\n\nThe liquidity pool at \u00a3291bn (December 2020: \u00a3266bn) reflects the Group's prudent approach to liquidity management. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) remained well above the 100% regulatory requirement at 168% (December 2020: 162%), equivalent to a surplus of \u00a3116bn (December 2020: \u00a399bn). The increase in the liquidity pool, LCR and surplus over the year was driven by continued deposit growth, borrowing from the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) and an increase in wholesale funding, which were partly offset by an increase in business funding consumption .\n\nBarclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term and medium-term markets and Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active secured funding programmes. This funding capacity enables the respective entities maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nThe Group's reliance on short-term wholesale funding, as measured by the proportion of wholesale funding maturing in less than one year increased year-on-year. At 31 December 2021, it was 36% (December 2020: 29%).\n\n## Liquidity risk stress testing\n\n## Liquidity risk appetite\n\nUnder the Liquidity Framework, the Group has established a liquidity risk appetite (LRA) together with the appropriate limits for the management of the liquidity risk. This is the level of liquidity risk the Group chooses to take in pursuit of its business objectives and in meeting its regulatory obligations. The Group sets its internal liquidity risk appetite based on internal liquidity risk assessments and, external regulatory requirements namely the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).\n\nThe liquidity risk assessment measures the potential contractual and contingent stress outflows under a range of stress scenarios, which are then used to determine the size of the liquidity pool that is immediately available to meet anticipated outflows should a stress occur.\n\n- \u25a0 90 days market-wide stress event\n\nAs part of the LRA, the Group runs three short-term liquidity stress scenarios, aligned to the PRA's prescribed stresses:\n\n- \u25a0 30 days Barclays-specific stress event\n- \u25a0 combined 30 days market-wide and Barclays-specific stress event",

As at 31 December 2021, the Group remained compliant with this internal metric.\n\nCertain Basel III standards including those relating to the introduction of the liquidity adequacy requirement measured through the LCR were implemented in EU law through CRR, as amended by CRRII, and the Capital Requirements Directive IV. These standards were retained in the UK regulatory framework via a series of onshoring instruments as part of the UK's withdrawal from the EU. In October 2021, the PRA published the final policy statement setting out its planned implementation of supplementary Basel III standards, including the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). These came into effect in the UK on 1 January 2022 from which date the Group monitors its position against both the LCR and NSFR.\n\nAs a result of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, EEA government bonds and central bank exposures no longer automatically qualify as Level 1 HQLA. This would impact both the LCR and NSFR metrics. In December 2021, following its consultation process on implementing CRR II in the UK, the PRA introduced a modification by consent (MBC) which would allow for the ongoing recognition of EEA government and central bank assets as Level 1 HQLA for the purposes of the LCR and NSFR. Barclays applied for this MBC which was granted by the PRA in December 2021.\n\nThe LCR is designed to promote short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile by holding sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) to survive an acute stress scenario lasting for 30 days. The NSFR has been developed to promote a sustainable and stable structure of assets and liabilities. Barclays is compliant with the NSFR requirement in effect from 1 January 2022.\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio\n\nThe external LCR requirement is prescribed by the regulator taking into account the relative stability of different sources of funding and potential incremental funding requirements in a stress.\n\n| As at 31 December         | 2021 \u00a3bn   | 2020 \u00a3bn   |\n|---------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Eligible liquidity buffer | 285        | 258        |\n| Net stress outflows       | (169)      | (159)      |\n| Surplus                   | 116        | 99         |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio  | 168%       | 162%       |\n\nAs part of the LRA, Barclays also establishes the minimum LCR limit. The Group plans to maintain its surplus to the internal and regulatory stress requirements at an efficient level, while continuously assessing risks to market funding conditions and its liquidity position and taking actions to manage the size of the liquidity pool as appropriate.",

It also incorporates other CRR (as amended by CRR II) qualifying assets that are not eligible under Barclays' internal risk appetite.\n\nLiquidity pool by currency\n\nThe Group liquidity pool is well diversified by major currency and the Group monitors LRA stress scenarios for major currencies.\n\n|                                       | USD    | EUR    | GBP    | Other   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Liquidity pool as at 31 December 2021 | \u00a3bn 59 | \u00a3bn 52 | \u00a3bn    | \u00a3bn 48  | \u00a3bn 291 |\n| Liquidity pool as at 31 December 2020 | 60     | 50     | 132 80 | 76      | 266     |\n\n## Management of the liquidity pool\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, 58% (2020: 64%) of the liquidity pool was located in Barclays Bank PLC, 30% (2020: 23%) in Barclays Bank UK PLC and 7% (2020: 7%) in Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. The residual portion of the liquidity pool is held outside of these entities, predominantly in the US subsidiaries, to meet entity-specific stress outflows and local regulatory requirements. To the extent the use of this portion of the liquidity pool is restricted due to local regulatory requirements, it is assumed to be unavailable to the rest of the Group in calculating the LCR.\n\nThe composition of the liquidity pool is subject to limits set by the Board and the independent liquidity risk, credit risk and market risk functions. In addition, the investment of the liquidity pool is monitored for concentration risk by issuer, currency and asset type. Given the returns generated by these highly liquid assets, the risk and reward profile is continuously managed.\n\n## Contingent liquidity\n\nIn a Barclays-specific, market-wide or combined liquidity stress, liquidity available via market sources could be severely disrupted. In circumstances where market liquidity is unavailable or available only at significantly elevated prices, the Group could generate liquidity via central bank facilities. To this end, as at 31 December 2021, the Group had \u00a393.3bn (December 2020: \u00a399.2bn) of assets positioned at various central banks.\n\nIn addition to the Group liquidity pool, the Group has access to other unencumbered assets which provide a source of contingent liquidity. While these are not relied on in the Group's LRA, a portion of these assets may be monetised in a stress to generate liquidity through their use as collateral for secured funding or through outright sale.\n\nFor more detail on the Group's other unencumbered assets, see pages 221 to 223 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).",

As such, retail and corporate loans and advances are largely funded by deposits in the relevant entities, with the surplus primarily funding the liquidity pool. The majority of reverse repurchase agreements are matched by repurchase agreements. Derivative liabilities and assets are largely matched. A substantial proportion of balance sheet derivative positions qualify for counterparty netting and the remaining portions are largely offset when netted against cash collateral received and paid. Wholesale debt and equity is used to fund residual assets.\n\nThe basis for sound liquidity risk management is a funding structure that reduces the probability of a liquidity stress leading to an inability to meet funding obligations as they fall due. The Group's overall funding strategy is to develop a diversified funding base (geographically, by type and by counterparty) and maintain access to a variety of alternative funding sources, to provide protection against unexpected fluctuations, while minimising the cost of funding.\n\nThese funding relationships are summarised below:\n\n| Assets                                                                                             | 2021 \u00a3bn   | 2020 \u00a3bn   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost a                                                             | 358        | 335        |\n| Group liquidity pool                                                                               | 291        | 266        |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements, trading  portfolio assets, cash collateral and  settlement balances | 388        | 376        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                   | 263        | 302        |\n| Other assets b                                                                                     | 84         | 71         |\n| Total assets                                                                                       | 1,384      | 1,350      |\n\n| Liabilities                                                                                     | 2021 \u00a3bn   | 2020 \u00a3bn   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deposits at amortised cost                                                                      | 519        | 481        |\n| <1 Year wholesale funding                                                                       | 61         | 43         |\n| >1 Year wholesale funding                                                                       | 107        | 102        |\n| Repurchase agreements, trading portfolio  liabilities, cash collateral and settlement  balances | 330        | 324        |\n| Derivative financial instruments                                                                | 257        | 301        |\n| Other liabilities                                                                               |            |            |\n|                                                                                                 | 40         | 32         |\n| Equity                                                                                          | 70         | 67         |\n| Total liabilities                                                                               | 1,384      | 1,350      |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Other assets include fair value assets that are not part of reverse repurchase agreements or trading portfolio assets, and other asset categories.\n- a Adjusted for liquidity pool debt securities reported at amortised costs of \u00a33bn (December 2020: \u00a38bn).\n\nDeposit funding (audited)\n\n| Funding of loans and advances   | Loans and   advances at  amortised cost   | Deposits at  amortised   cost   | 2021 Loan:   deposit ratio a   | 2020 Loan:   deposit  ratio   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021          | \u00a3bn                                       | \u00a3bn                             | %                              | %                             |\n| Barclays UK                     | 222                                       | 260                             | 85%                            | 89%                           |\n| Barclays International          | 134                                       | 259                             | 52%                            | 51%                           |\n| Head Office                     | 5                                         | -                               |                                |                               |\n| Barclays Group                  | 361                                       | 519                             | 70%                            | 71%                           |\n\n## Note\n\n- a The loan: deposit ratio is calculated as loans and advances at amortised cost divided by deposits at amortised cost.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, \u00a3222bn (2020: \u00a3209bn) of total customer deposits were insured through the UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and other similar schemes. In addition to these customer deposits \u00a31.3bn (2020: \u00a32bn) of other liabilities are insured by other governments.\n\nThe Group's broad base of customers, numerically and by depositor type, helps protect against unexpected fluctuations in balances and hence provides a stable funding base for the Group's operations and liquidity needs.\n\nContractually current accounts are repayable on demand and savings accounts at short notice. In practice, their observed maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity. Similarly, repayment profiles of certain types of assets e.g. mortgages, overdrafts and credit card lending, differ from their contractual profiles. The Group therefore assesses the behavioural maturity of both customer assets and liabilities to identify structural balance sheet funding gaps. In doing so, it applies quantitative modelling and qualitative assessments which take into account historical experience, current customer composition, and macroeconomic projections.",

Key sources of wholesale funding include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, medium term issuances (including structured notes) and securitisations.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group maintain access to a variety of sources of wholesale funds in major currencies, including those available from term investors across a variety of distribution channels and geographies, short-term funding markets and repo markets.\n\nKey sources of wholesale funding for Barclays Bank UK Group include money markets, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, covered bonds and other securitisations.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active medium-term notes programmes. Barclays Bank UK PLC continued to issue in the shorter-term markets and maintain active secured funding programmes. This funding capacity enables the respective entities to maintain their stable and diversified funding bases.\n\nThe Group expects to continue issuing public wholesale debt from Barclays PLC (the Parent company), in order to maintain compliance with indicative MREL requirements and maintain a stable and diverse funding base by type, currency and market. During the year, the Group issued \u00a311.0bn of MREL instruments from Barclays PLC (the Parent company) in a range of different currencies and tenors.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group's total wholesale funding outstanding (excluding repurchase agreements) was \u00a3167.5bn (2020: \u00a3145.0bn), of which \u00a316.6bn (2020: \u00a317.1bn) was secured funding and \u00a3150.9bn (2020: \u00a3127.9bn) unsecured funding. Unsecured funding includes \u00a359.7bn (2020: \u00a354.8bn) of privately placed senior unsecured notes issued through a variety of distribution channels including intermediaries and private banks.\n\nBarclays Bank Group and Barclays Bank UK Group also support various central bank monetary initiatives, such as the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME), and the European Central Bank's Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO). These are reported under 'repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing' on the balance sheet.\n\nWholesale funding of \u00a360.7bn (2020: \u00a342.7bn) matures in less than one year, representing 36% (December 2020: 29%) of total wholesale funding outstanding. This includes \u00a318.9bn (2020: \u00a320.3bn) related to term funding b . Although not a requirement, the liquidity pool exceeded the wholesale funding maturing in less than one year by \u00a3230bn (2020: \u00a3223bn).\n\nIn 2021, Barclays repaid \u00a31.4bn of Term Funding Scheme (TFS) drawings early, reducing the outstanding drawn balance under TFS to \u00a30.0bn as at 31 December 2021. In addition, Barclays drew an additional \u00a315.4bn under the TFSME and an additional \u00a30.5bn under the TLTRO; \u00a322.0bn TFSME and \u00a32.7bn TLTRO balances were outstanding at the year-end.\n\n|                                               | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   | Maturity profile of wholesale funding a,b   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                               | <1 month                                    | 1-3  months                                 | 3-6  months                                 | 6-12  months                                | <1 year                                     | 1-2 years                                   | 2-3 years                                   | 3-4 years                                   | 4-5 years                                   | >5 years                                    | Total                                       |\n|                                               | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         | \u00a3bn                                         |\n| Barclays PLC (the Parent company)             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                             |\n| Senior unsecured (Public benchmark)           | -

These ratings assess the creditworthiness of the Group, its subsidiaries and its branches, and are based on reviews of a broad range of business and financial attributes including capital strength, profitability, funding, liquidity, asset quality, strategy and governance.\n\n| Credit ratings                           | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's       | Fitch     |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|\n| As at 31 December 2021 Barclays Bank PLC |                     |               |           |\n| Long term                                | A/Positive          | A1/Stable     | A+/Stable |\n| Short term                               | A-1                 | P-1           | F1        |\n| Barclays Bank UK PLC                     |                     |               |           |\n| Long term                                | A/Positive          | A1/Stable     | A+/Stable |\n| Short term                               | A-1                 | P-1           | F1        |\n| Barclays PLC                             |                     |               |           |\n| Long term                                | BBB/Positive        | Baa2/Positive | A/Stable  |\n| Short term                               | A-2                 | P-2           | F1        |\n\nIn June 2021, S&P revised the outlooks of Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC to positive from stable, whilst affirming all ratings. The revisions reflect the view that Barclays is delivering a stronger, more consistent business profile and financial performance.\n\nIn July 2021, Fitch revised the outlooks of Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC to stable from negative, whilst affirming all ratings. The revisions reflected improved expectations for economic recovery in Barclays' key markets and the Group's resilient performance through the pandemic.\n\nIn July 2021, Moody's revised the outlook of Barclays Bank UK PLC to stable from negative due to their view that asset quality and profitability have stabilised following a turbulent 2020. In November 2021, Moody's revised the outlook of Barclays PLC to positive from stable , whilst affirming all ratings. The revisions reflect Moody's view that the level and stability of the Group's earnings could further improve once global macroeconomic conditions normalise, recognising the balanced earnings streams and stable operating costs.\n\nBarclays also solicits issuer ratings from R&I. In November 2021, R&I upgraded the issuer ratings of Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC by one notch to A and A+ respectively.\n\nThe contractual collateral requirement following one- and two-notch long-term and associated short-term downgrades across all credit rating agencies, would result in outflows of \u00a31bn and \u00a34bn respectively, and are provided for in determining an appropriate liquidity pool size given the Group's liquidity risk appetite. These numbers do not assume any management or restructuring actions that could be taken to reduce posting requirements. These outflows do not include the potential liquidity impact from loss of unsecured funding, such as from money market funds, or loss of secured funding capacity. However, unsecured and secured funding stresses are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against these risks.\n\nA credit rating downgrade could result in outflows to meet collateral requirements on existing contracts. Outflows related to credit rating downgrades are included in the LRA stress scenarios and a portion of the liquidity pool is held against this risk. Credit ratings downgrades could also result in reduced funding capacity and increased funding costs.",

cost, are repayable on demand or at short notice on a contractual basis. In practice, their behavioural maturity is typically longer than their contractual maturity, and therefore these deposits provide stable funding for the Group's operations and liquidity needs because of the broad base of customers, both numerically and by depositor type\n- \u25a0 trading portfolio assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments, which may not be held to maturity as part of the Group's trading strategies\n- \u25a0 loans to corporate and retail customers, which are included within loans and advances at amortised cost and financial assets at fair value, may be repaid earlier in line with terms and conditions of the contract\n- \u25a0 debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities, and financial liabilities designated at fair value, may include early redemption features.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Maintenance of our capital resources is vital in order to meet the overall regulatory capital requirement, to withstand the impact of the risks that may arise under normal and stressed conditions, and to cover current and forecast business needs and associated risks to provide a viable and sustainable business offering.\n\nMore details on monitoring and managing capital risk may be found in the risk management sections of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited).\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Group's: (i) CET1 capital, leverage and own funds and eligible liabilities requirements; (ii) capital resources; (iii) risk weighted assets (RWAs); (iv) leverage ratios and exposures; and (v) own funds and eligible liabilities.\n\n## Key metrics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio 15.1% Average UK leverage ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.0%\n\n4.9% UK leverage ratio 5.3% Own funds and eligible liabilities ratio as a percentage of CRR leverage exposures a,b\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Excludes subsidiary issuances which cannot be counted towards the Group's MREL from 1 January 2022.  The own funds and eligible liabilities ratio including subsidiary issuances was 8.1%.\n- a Fully loaded CRR leverage exposure is calculated without applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II.\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nCET1 capital increased by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a347.5bn as profit before tax of \u00a38.4bn was partially offset by share buybacks, 2021 dividends and equity coupons paid and foreseen as well as pensions deficit contribution payments.\n\nThe Group continues to be in excess of overall capital, leverage and MREL regulatory requirements.\n\nRWAs increased \u00a37.9bn to \u00a3314.1bn primarily resulting from the recalibration of the modelled market risk stress period, increased client and trading activity within CIB and growth in mortgages within Barclays UK, partially offset by lower unsecured balances.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Barclays PLC (the Parent company) had \u00a3108.2bn of own funds and eligible liabilities equating to 8% of CRR leverage exposures.  This was in excess of the Group's MREL requirement to hold \u00a393.9bn of own funds and eligible liabilities, equating to 6.9% of CRR leverage exposures.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio decreased to 4.9% (December 2020: 5.0%). The average leverage exposure increased by \u00a380.2bn to \u00a31,227.1bn largely driven by an increase in securities financing transactions (SFTs), potential future exposure (PFE) on derivatives and trading portfolio assets (TPAs) .\n\n## Minimum capital requirements\n\nThe Group's CCyB is based on the buffer rate applicable for each jurisdiction in which the Group has exposures. On 11 March 2020, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) set the CCyB rate for UK exposures at 0% with immediate effect. The buffer rates set by other national authorities for non-UK exposures are not currently material. Overall, this results in a 0.0% CCyB for the Group. On 13 December 2021, the FPC announced that a CCyB rate of 1% for UK exposures has been re-introduced and will be applicable from 13 December 2022.\n\nThe Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 is 11.1% comprising a 4.5% Pillar 1 minimum, a 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB), a 1.5% Global Systemically Important Institution (G-SII) buffer, a 2.6% Pillar 2A requirement and a 0% Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group's Pillar 2A requirement as per the PRA's Individual Capital Requirement was set as a nominal amount.\n\nWhen expressed as a percentage of RWAs this was 4.6% of which at least 56.25% needed to be met with CET1 capital, equating to approximately 2.6% of RWAs. The Pillar 2A requirement is subject to at least annual review and is based on a point in time assessment.\n\nThe Group is subject to a leverage ratio requirement of 3.8% as at 31 December 2021. This comprises the 3.25% minimum requirement, a G-SII additional leverage ratio buffer (G-SII ALRB) of 0.53% and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer of 0.0%. Although the leverage ratio is expressed in terms of T1 capital, 75% of the minimum requirement, equating to 2.4375%, needs to be met with CET1 capital. In addition, the G-SII ALRB must be covered solely with CET1 capital. The CET1 capital held against the 0.53% G-SII ALRB was \u00a36.0bn.\n\n## Minimum leverage requirements\n\n## Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities\n\nCET1 capital cannot be counted towards both MREL and the capital buffers, meaning that the buffers will effectively be applied above MREL requirements.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group was required to meet the higher of: (i) the MREL set by the Bank of England (BoE); and (ii) the requirements in CRR as amended by CRR II, both of which have RWA and leverage measures.\n\n## Significant regulatory updates in the period\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, any references to CRR as amended by CRR II mean, unless otherwise specified, CRR as amended by CRR II, as it forms part of UK law pursuant to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and subject to the temporary transitional powers (TTP) available to UK regulators to delay or phase-in on-shoring changes to UK regulatory requirements arising at the end of the transition period until 31 March 2022, as at the applicable reporting date.",

amount of relief applied to the pre-2020 impairment charge reducing to 50% in 2021 from 70% in 2020\n- \u25a0 A \u00a30.4bn increase in the PVA deduction due to the reversal of temporary COVID-19 relief measures which increased diversification factors applied to certain additional valuation adjustments during 2020\n- \u25a0 A \u00a30.7bn decrease as a result of movements relating to pensions, largely due to deficit contribution payments of \u00a30.35bn in April 2021 and September 2021",

Fully loaded UK leverage ratio was 5.2%, with \u00a358.4bn of T1 capital and \u00a31,134.8bn of leverage exposure. Fully loaded UK leverage ratios are calculated without applying the transitional arrangements of the CRR as amended by CRR II.\n- c The T1 capital is calculated in line with the PRA Handbook.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio decreased to 4.9% (December 2020: 5.0%). The average leverage exposure increased by \u00a380.2bn to \u00a31,227.1bn (December 2020: \u00a31,146.9bn) largely driven by balance sheet increases in SFTs and TPAs as well as, PFE on derivatives.\n\nThe Group also discloses a CRR leverage ratio a within its additional regulatory disclosures prepared in accordance with EBA guidelines on disclosure under Part Eight of the CRR (see Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021, due to be published on 23 February 2022 and which will be available at home.barclays/ investor-relations/reports-and-events/annual-reports).\n\nThe UK leverage ratio remained stable at 5.3% (December 2020: 5.3%) primarily driven by a \u00a32.3bn increase in T1 capital offset by a \u00a345.1bn increase in UK leverage exposure. The UK leverage exposure increase to \u00a31,136.0bn (December 2020: \u00a31,090.9bn) was primarily driven by a \u00a320.3bn increase in PFE on derivatives, a \u00a319.1bn increase in TPAs due to increased trading activity in CIB, \u00a318.8bn increase in loans and advances at amortised cost, and a \u00a36.8bn increase in SFTs, offset by a \u00a316.9bn decrease in assets at fair value through other comprehensive income due to disposals.\n\n## Note\n\n- a CRR leverage ratio as amended by CRR II.",

This includes IFRS 9 transitional arrangements and the grandfathering of CRR and CRR II non-compliant capital instruments.\n- c Includes other AT1 capital regulatory adjustments and deductions of \u00a380m (December 2020: \u00a380m), and other T2 credit risk adjustments and deductions of \u00a387m (December 2020: \u00a3103m).\n\n## Regulatory changes as implemented by the Prudential Regulation Authority\n\n## Capital and RWAs\n\nThe PRA has implemented several regulatory changes impacting the calculation of the CET1 ratio within the UK. Changes have also been implemented following the review of the UK Leverage framework and the setting of MREL requirements. All changes took effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nOn 19 July 2019, the EBA published a report on the implementation of IRB roadmap changes. These have subsequently been implemented by the PRA via several Policy Statements. Key changes include revisions to the criteria for definition of default, PD and LGD estimation to ensure supervisory consistency and increase transparency of IRB models.\n\n## UK Leverage Ratio Framework\n\nOn 14 October 2021, the PRA finalised their implementation of Basel standards through Policy Statement 22/21. The finalised requirements included the introduction of the Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (SA-CCR) which replaces the Current Exposure Method (CEM) for Standardised derivative exposures as a more risk sensitive approach. The PRA also confirmed the intention to revert to the previous treatment of 100% CET1 capital deduction for qualifying software assets, meaning the c.35bps benefit in the CET1 ratio will be reversed.\n\nOn 8 October 2021, the PRA published its Policy Statement on the UK leverage ratio framework. The Policy Statement confirms that UK banks will be subject to a single UK leverage ratio requirement meaning that the CRR leverage ratio will no longer apply for UK banks. Whilst largely upholding the existing framework, technical changes generally align to the Basel III standards with the exception of the qualifying claims on central banks exemption. Central bank claims can be excluded from the UK leverage ratio measure as long as they are matched by qualifying liabilities (rather than deposits). Minimum requirements for the Group remain the same with minimum requirements also expected to be applied at the individual level from 1 January 2023. Individual requirements may be replaced with a sub-consolidated measure, subject to permission from the PRA.\n\nOn 3 December 2021 the BoE set new MREL requirements via an updated Statement of Policy removing the requirements under CRR, meaning that from 1 January 2022 the Group will be required to meet the higher of (i) 2 times 8% Pillar 1 and 4.6% Pillar 2A requirement; and (ii) 6.75% of UK leverage exposure. Using the rebased 1 January 2022 RWAs and UK leverage exposure, the MREL requirement is expected to be \u00a393.6bn based on RWAs. The Group currently holds \u00a3108.2bn of own funds and eligible liabilities which is above the expected 2022 minimum requirement. The Statement of Policy also confirmed that own funds instruments issued by subsidiaries cannot count towards the Group's MREL from 1 January 2022.\n\n## MREL requirements\n\nBarclays has calculated RWAs, Leverage exposures and Capital and Leverage ratios reflecting our interpretation of the latest rules and guidance.",

As such this risk review section focuses exclusively on the UKRF. The UKRF is closed to new entrants and there is no new final salary benefit being accrued. Existing active members accrue a combination of a cash balance benefit and a defined contribution element. Pension risk arises as the market value of the pension fund assets may decline, investment returns may reduce or the estimated value of the pension liabilities may increase.\n\n## Assets\n\n## Liabilities\n\nThe Trustee Board of the UKRF defines its overall long-term investment strategy with investments across a broad range of asset classes. This results in an appropriate mix of return seeking assets as well as liability matching assets to better match future pension obligations. The two largest market risks within the asset portfolio are interest rates and equities. The split of scheme assets is shown within Note 33 to the financial statements. The fair value of the UKRF assets was \u00a334.7bn as at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a333.9bn).\n\nThe UKRF retirement benefit obligations are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term price inflation rate (RPI) and the discount rate (GBP AA corporate bond yield):\n\n- \u25a0 A decrease in the discount rate corresponds to an increase in liabilities.\n- \u25a0 An increase in long-term expected inflation corresponds to an increase in liabilities;\n\nPension risk is generated through the Group's defined benefit schemes and this risk is set to reduce over time as the main defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants. The chart below outlines the shape of the UKRF's liability cash flow profile as at 31 December 2021 that takes account of the future inflation indexing of payments to beneficiaries. The majority of the cash flows (approximately 95%) fall between 0 and 40 years, peaking between 11 and 20 years and reducing thereafter. The shape may vary depending on changes to inflation and longevity expectations and any members who elect to transfer out. Transfers out will bring forward the liability cash flows.\n\nFor more detail on the UKRF's financial and demographic assumptions, see Note 33 to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe graph above shows the evolution of the UKRF's net IAS 19 position over the last two years. During 2021 the increase in the IAS 19 pension surplus was driven by high asset returns and scheduled deficit reduction contributions. Higher realised inflation over the year had a negative impact by increasing the projected liabilities, which was partially offset by updates to the demographic assumptions.\n\nRefer to Note 33 to the financial statements  for the sensitivity of the UKRF to changes in key assumptions.\n\ncla\n\ny",

        "page_content": "## Risk measurement\n\nThe pension liability is also sensitive to post-retirement mortality assumptions which are reviewed regularly (see Note 33 to the financial statements). To mitigate part of this risk the UKRF has entered into a longevity swap hedging approximately a quarter of current pensioner liabilities.\n\nIn line with Barclays' risk management framework the assets and liabilities of the UKRF are modelled within a VaR framework to show the volatility of the pension position at a total portfolio level. This enables the risks, diversification and liability matching characteristics of the UKRF obligations and investments to be adequately captured. VaR is measured and monitored on a monthly basis. Risks are reviewed and reported regularly at forums including the Board Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee, the Pensions Management Group and the Pension Executive Board. The VaR model takes into account the valuation of the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis (see Note 33 to the financial statements). The Trustee receives quarterly VaR measures on a funding basis.\n\nIn addition, the impact of pension risk to the Group is taken into account as part of the stress testing process. Stress testing is performed internally on at least an annual basis. The UKRF exposure is also included as part of regulatory stress tests.\n\n- \u25a0 An IAS 19 deficit is treated as a liability on the Group's balance sheet. Movement in a deficit due to remeasurements, including actuarial losses, are recognised immediately through Other Comprehensive Income and as such reduces shareholders' equity and CET1 capital. An IAS 19 surplus is treated as an asset on the balance sheet and increases shareholders' equity; however, it is deducted for the purposes of determining CET1 capital.\n\nBarclays defined benefit pension schemes affects capital in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 In the Group's statutory balance sheet an IAS 19 surplus or deficit is partially offset by a deferred tax liability or asset respectively. These may or may not be recognised for calculating CET1 capital depending on the overall deferred tax position of the Group at the particular time.\n\nPension risk is taken into account in the Pillar 2A capital assessment undertaken by the PRA at least annually. The Pillar 2A requirement forms part of the Group's Overall Capital Requirement for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. More detail on minimum regulatory requirements can be found in the Overall capital requirements section.",

The hedges in place remove interest rate risk and smooth income over the medium term. The NII sensitivity for the Group at 31 December 2021 without hedging in place for +/-25bp rate shocks would be \u00a3218m/\u00a3305m respectively.\n- \u25a0 +25bps AEaR in Barclays International reflects refined modelling of pricing assumptions for 2021. Based on these assumptions, the 2020 scenario would have shown an AEaR of \u00a3121m.\n\nNII asymmetry arises due to the current low interest rate levels and the effect of embedded floors in customer products. NII sensitivity to a -25bp shock to rates has decreased year on year due to reduced margin compression exposure driven by actual and expected central bank rate increases. NII sensitivity to a +25bps shock has similarly decreased year on year driven by the expectation of rate rises in the outlook and the decompression of product margins in the base case.\n\ncla\n\ny\n\nThe table below shows a sensitivity analysis on pre-tax net interest income for non-traded financial assets and liabilities, including the effect of any hedging. This analysis is not a forward guidance on NII and is intended as a quantification of risk exposure utilising the AEaR metric as described on page 200 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited). Note that this metric assumes an instantaneous parallel change to forward interest rate curves. The model does not apply floors to shocked market rates, but does recognise contractual product specific interest rate floors where relevant.",

The non-traded VaR represents the volatility to capital driven by the FVOCI exposures. These exposures are in the banking book and do not meet the criteria for trading book treatment.\n\nChanges in value of FVOCI exposures flow directly through capital via the FVOCI reserve. The volatility of the value of the FVOCI investments in the liquidity pool is captured and managed through a value measure rather than an earning measure, i.e. non-traded market risk VaR.\n\n## Analysis of volatility of the FVOCI portfolio in the liquidity pool\n\n|                                              | 2021    | 2021   | 2021   | 2020    | 2020   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n|                                              | Average | High   | Low    | Average | High   | Low    |\n| For the year ended 31 December               | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n| Non-traded market value at risk (daily, 95%) | 51      | 62     | 34     | 52      | 68     | 36     |\n\nVaR trend remained in  ~\u00a310m range in  H1 2021.

The Operational Risk Framework is therefore focused on identifying operational risks, assessing them and managing them within the Group's approved risk appetite.\n\nFor definitions of these risks refer to pages 201 to 204 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021. In order to provide complete coverage of the potential adverse impacts on the Group arising from operational risk, the operational risk taxonomy extends beyond the risks listed above to cover operational risks associated with other principal risks too.\n\nThe Operational Risk principal risk comprises the following risks: Data Management Risk; Financial Reporting Risk; Fraud Risk; Information Security Risk, Operational Recovery Planning Risk, Payments Process Risk; People Risk; Physical Security Risk; Premises Risk; Risk Reporting; Strategic Investment Change Management Risk; Supplier Risk; Tax Risk; Technology Risk and Transaction Operations Risk. The operational risk profile is also informed by a number of risk themes: Cyber, Data, and Resilience. These represent threats to the Group that extend across multiple risk types, and therefore require an integrated risk management approach.\n\nThis section provides an analysis of the Group's operational risk profile, including events above the Group's reportable threshold, which have had a financial impact in 2021. The Group's operational risk profile is informed by bottom-up risk assessments undertaken by each business unit and top-down qualitative review for each risk type. Fraud, Transaction Operations, Information Security and Technology continue to be highlighted as key operational risk exposures.\n\nFor information on conduct risk events, see the conduct risk section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof the Group's net reportable operational risk events had a loss value of \u00a350,000 or less\n\nKey metrics 84%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n51%\n\n84% of events by number are due to External Fraud\n\nof losses are from events aligned to External Fraud\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof losses are from events aligned to Execution, Delivery and Process Management\n\n48%\n\n## Summary of performance in the period\n\nDuring 2021, total operational risk losses a decreased to \u00a3157m (2020: \u00a3217m) while the number of recorded events for 2021 (2,722) increased from the level for 2020 (2,258). The total operational risk losses for the year were mainly driven by events falling within the Execution, Delivery & Process Management and External Fraud categories, which tend to be high volume but low impact events.\n\n## Operational risk profile\n\nWithin operational risk, there are a large number of smaller value risk events. In 2021, 84% (2020: 78%) of the Group's reportable operational risk events by volume had a value of less than \u00a350,000 each. Cumulatively, events under this \u00a350,000 threshold accounted for only 29% (2020: 16%) of the Group's total net operational risk losses. A small proportion of operational risk events have a material impact on the financial results of the Group.\n\ncla\n\ny",

A boundary event is an operational risk event that results in a credit risk impact. Due to the nature of risk events that keep evolving, prior year losses are updated.\n- \u25a0 External Fraud remains the category with the highest frequency of events at 84% of total events in 2021 (2020: 71%). Impacts from events arising from External Fraud increased in 2021 to \u00a379m (2020: \u00a351m) and accounted for 51% of total 2021 losses\n\n(2020: 23%). In this category, high volume, low value events are driven by transactional fraud often related to debit and credit card usage.\n\n- \u25a0 Execution, Delivery and Process Management impacts fell to \u00a375m (2020: \u00a3152m) and accounted for 48% (2020: 70%) of total operational risk losses. The events in this category are typical of the banking industry as a whole where high volumes of transactions are processed on a daily basis, mapping mainly to Barclays Transaction Operations risk type. The overall frequency of events in this category also decreased to 14% of total events by volume (2020: 25%).\n\nOperational Resilience remains a key area of focus for the Group. The COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe global health emergency the World Health Organization (WHO) has ever declared. While overall, the Group has continued to prove resilient and actual losses have not materially increased due to the effects of the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption to the Group's customers, suppliers, and staff globally. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced our continued focus on resilience and the Group continues to monitor potential operational disruptions associated with both the Group's and its suppliers' transition to a Work-from-Home environment and in response to initially high market volatility. The Group continues to strengthen its resilience approach across its most important business services to improve recoverability and assurance thereof.\n\nInvestment continues to be made in improving the control environment across the Group. Particular areas of focus include new and enhanced fraud prevention systems and tools to combat the increasing level of fraud attempts being made whilst minimising disruption to genuine transactions. Fraud remains an industry wide threat and the Group continues to work closely with external partners on various prevention initiatives.\n\nOperational risk associated with cybersecurity remains a top focus for the Group. The sophistication of threat actors continues to grow as noted by multiple external risk events observed throughout the year. Ransomware attacks across the global Barclays supplier base were observed and we worked closely with the affected suppliers to manage potential impacts to the Group and its clients and customers. The Group's cybersecurity events were managed within its risk tolerances and there were no material loss events associated with cybersecurity recorded within the event categories above.\n\nFor further information, refer to the operational risk management section.",

The Group will continue to enhance effective management of conduct risk and appropriately consider the relevant tools, governance and management information in decision-making processes. Focus on management of conduct risk is ongoing and, alongside other relevant business and control management information, the Trading Entity conduct risk dashboard is a key component of this.\n\nThe Group continues to review the role and impact of conduct risk events and issues in remuneration decisions at both the individual and business level.\n\nBusinesses have continued to assess the potential customer, client and market impacts of strategic change. As part of the 2021 mediumterm planning process, material conduct risks associated with strategic and financial plans were assessed.\n\nThroughout 2021, the Group maintained focus on the new and heightened inherent conduct risks created by the coronavirus pandemic and continues to monitor these on an ongoing basis.\n\nThroughout 2021, conduct risks were raised by each business area for consideration by relevant Board level committees. These committees reviewed the risks raised and whether management's proposed actions were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively.\n\nTrading Entity conduct risk dashboards, setting out key indicators in relation to conduct and risk, are provided to the respective Board Risk Committees and senior management. These continue to be evolved and enhanced to allow effective oversight and decision-making. Barclays has operated at the overall set tolerance for conduct risk throughout 2021. The tolerance adherence is assessed by the business areas through key indicators  and reported to the relevant Trading Entity Board Committees as part of the conduct risk dashboards.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains a necessary and important part of delivering the Group's strategy and an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct.\n\nThe Group remains focused on the continuous improvements being made to manage risk effectively with an emphasis on enhancing governance and management information to identify risk at earlier stages.\n\n## Reputation risk\n\nBarclays is committed to identifying reputation risks and issues as early as possible and managing them appropriately. At a Group level throughout 2021, reputation risks and issues were overseen by the Board which reviews the processes and policies which Barclays identifies and manages reputation risk. Within the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group reputation risks and issues were overseen by the respective risk and Board risk committees. The top live and emerging reputation risks and issues\n\nwithin the Barclays Bank UK Group and the Barclays Bank Group are included within an over-arching quarterly report at the respective Board level.\n\nThe Group continued to incur costs in relation to litigation and conduct matters, refer to Note 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters and Note 24 Provisions for further details. Costs include customer redress and remediation, as well as fines and settlements. Resolution of these matters remains an ongoing commitment to improve oversight of culture and conduct and management of reputation risks.\n\nThe Board reviewed risks escalated by the businesses and considered whether management's proposed actions, for example attaching conditions to proposed client transactions or increased engagement with impacted stakeholders, were appropriate to mitigate the risks effectively. The Board also received regular updates with regard to key reputation risks and issues, including: Barclays' response to the pandemic; Barclays' association with sensitive sectors; access to banking; lending practices and the resilience of key Barclays systems and processes.\n\nAs part of Barclays 2021 Medium Term Planning process, material reputation risks associated with strategic and financial plans were also assessed.\n\n## Legal risk\n\nThroughout 2021, the Group has operated within set tolerances for legal risk. Tolerances adherence is assessed through key indicators, which are also used to evaluate the legal risk profile and are reviewed, at least annually, through the relevant risk and control committees. Minimum mandatory controls to manage legal risks are set out in the legal risk standards and are subject to ongoing monitoring.\n\nThe Group remains committed to continuous improvements in managing legal risk effectively. During 2021, improvements included a refresh of the Group-wide legal risk management framework and a review and update of the supporting legal risk policies, standards and mandatory training, reinforced by ongoing engagement with and education of the Group's businesses and functions by Legal Function colleagues. Legal risk tolerances and legal risk appetite have also been reviewed.",

We focus particularly on UK, US and EU regulation due to the location of the Group's principal areas of business. Regulations elsewhere may also have a significant impact on the Group due to the location of its branches, subsidiaries and, in some cases, clients. For more information on the risks related to the supervision and regulation of the Group, including regulatory change, see the material existing and emerging risk entitled 'Regulatory Change agenda and impact on Business Model' in the Material existing and emerging risks section.\n\nThe Group's operations, including its overseas branches, subsidiaries and associates, are subject to a large number of rules and regulations that are a condition for authorisation to conduct banking and financial services business in each of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. These apply to business operations, impact financial returns and include capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, authorisation, registration and reporting requirements, restrictions on certain activities, conduct of business regulations and many others.\n\n## Supervision in the UK\n\nBarclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC are authorised credit institutions and subject to prudential supervision by the PRA and subject to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. The Group is also subject to prudential supervision by the PRA on a group consolidated basis. Barclays PLC has submitted an application for approval by the PRA as a financial holding company. Barclays Capital Securities Limited is authorised and supervised by the PRA as a PRA-designated investment firm and subject to conduct regulation and supervision by the FCA. Barclays Execution Services Limited is an appointed representative of Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Clydesdale Financial Services Limited.\n\nIn the UK, day-to-day regulation and supervision of the Group is divided between the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) (a division of the Bank of England (BoE)) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). In addition, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the BoE has influence on the prudential requirements that may be imposed on the banking system through its powers of direction and recommendation. The Group is also subject to regulatory initiatives undertaken by the UK Payment Systems Regulator (PSR), as a participant in payment systems regulated by the PSR.\n\nThe PRA's supervision of the Group is conducted through a variety of regulatory tools, including the collection of information by way of prudential returns or cross-firm reviews, reports obtained from skilled persons, regular supervisory visits to firms and regular meetings with management and directors to discuss issues such as strategy, governance, financial resilience, operational resilience, risk management, and recovery and resolution.\n\nThe FCA's supervision of the UK firms in the Group is carried out through a combination of proactive engagement, regular thematic work and project work based on the FCA's sector assessments, which analyse the different areas of the market and the risks that may lie ahead.\n\nBoth the PRA and the FCA apply standards that either anticipate or go beyond requirements established by global or EU standards, whether in relation to capital, leverage and liquidity, resolvability and resolution or matters of conduct.\n\nThe FCA and the PRA also apply the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) which imposes a regulatory approval, individual accountability and fitness and propriety framework in respect of senior or key individuals within relevant firms.\n\nPRA supervision has focused on financial resilience, credit risk management, Board effectiveness, operational resilience, climate risk and resolvability, where resolvability is reviewed in conjunction with the Resolution Directorate (a separate division of the BoE).\n\nFCA supervision has focused on conduct risk and customer/client outcomes, including product design, customer behaviour, market operations, fair pricing, affordability, access to cash, and fair treatment of vulnerable customers.\n\nBoth the PRA and the FCA have assessed the impact of COVID-19 and Brexit on UK financial markets and customers as well as the orderly transition away from LIBOR.\n\nThe Group's operations in Europe are authorised and regulated by a combination of its home regulators and host regulators in the European countries where the Group operates.\n\n## Supervision in the EU\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is licensed as a credit institution by the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) and is designated as a significant institution falling under direct supervision on a solo basis by the European Central Bank (ECB) for prudential purposes. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC's EU branches are supervised by the ECB and are also subject to direct supervision for local conduct purposes by national supervisory authorities in the jurisdictions where they are established. Barclays Bank Ireland PLC is also subject to supervision by the CBI as home state or competent authority under various EU financial services directives and regulations.\n\n## Supervision in the US\n\nThe Group provides the majority of its cross-border banking and investment services to EEA clients via Barclays Bank Ireland PLC. Additionally, in certain EEA Member States, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (BCSL) have cross-border licences to enable them to continue to conduct a limited range of activities, including accessing EEA trading venues and interdealer trading. Barclays Bank PLC also has a Paris branch (to facilitate access to Target 2), which is regulated by the ACPR.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and its New York branch, and Barclays Bank PLC's US subsidiaries are subject to a comprehensive regulatory framework involving numerous statutes, rules and regulations in the US. For example, the Group's US activities and operations are subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), as well as additional supervision, requirements and restrictions imposed by other federal and state regulators and self-regulatory organisations (SROs). In some cases, US requirements may impose restrictions on the Group's global activities, in addition to its activities in the US.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays US Holdings Limited (BUSHL), Barclays US LLC (BUSL), and Barclays Group US Inc. (BGUS) are regulated as bank holding companies (BHCs) by the FRB. BUSL is the Group's top-tier US holding company that holds substantially all of the Group's US subsidiaries (including Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware). BUSL is subject to requirements in respect of capital adequacy, capital planning and stress testing, risk management and governance, liquidity, leverage limits, large exposure limits, activities restrictions and financial regulatory reporting. Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch is also subject to enhanced prudential standards relating to, among other things, liquidity and risk management.",

FHC status allows these entities to engage in a variety of financial and related activities, directly or through subsidiaries, including underwriting, dealing and market making in securities. Failure to maintain FHC status could result in increasingly stringent penalties and, ultimately, in the closure or cessation of certain operations in the US.\n\nThe Group's US securities broker/dealer and investment banking operations, are conducted primarily through Barclays Capital Inc., and are also subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and other government agencies and SROs under US federal and state securities laws. BCI is also registered as Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), through which the Group conducts its US futures and options on futures business, including client clearing operations, which are subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by the CFTC, the National Futures Association and other SROs.\n\nIn addition to oversight by the FRB, Barclays Bank PLC's New York branch and many of the Group's subsidiaries are regulated by additional authorities based on the location or activities of those entities. The New York branch of Barclays Bank PLC is subject to supervision and regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS). Barclays Bank Delaware, a Delaware chartered bank, is subject to supervision and regulation by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The deposits of Barclays Bank Delaware are insured by the FDIC. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BUSHL, BUSL, and BGUS are required to act as a source of strength for Barclays Bank Delaware. This could, among other things, require these entities to inject capital into Barclays Bank Delaware if it fails to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements.\n\nUnder the US framework for regulating swaps and security-based swaps established under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has regulatory authority over swaps, the SEC has regulatory authority over security-based swaps, and the Commissions jointly regulate mixed swaps. Accordingly, the Group's US swaps and security-based swaps related activities are conducted by Barclays Bank PLC and are subject to ongoing supervision and regulation by, the CFTC and the National Futures Association, and the SEC and FINRA, respectively. Barclays Bank PLC is provisionally registered as a Swap Dealer with the CFTC and conditionally registered as a Security-based Swap Dealer with the SEC. Barclays Bank PLC is also subject to the FRB swaps rules with respect to margin and capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's operations in Asia Pacific are supervised and regulated by a broad range of national banking and financial services regulators.\n\n## Supervision in Asia Pacific\n\n## Prudential regulation\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs), such as the Barclays Group, are subject to a number of additional prudential requirements, including the requirement to hold additional loss-absorbing capacity and additional capital buffers above the level required by Basel III standards. The level of the G-SIB buffer is set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) according to a bank's systemic importance and can range from 1% to 3.5% of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The G-SIB buffer must be met with CET1. In November 2021, the FSB published an update to its list of G-SIBs, maintaining the 1.5% G-SIB buffer that applies to the Group.\n\nCertain Basel III standards were implemented in EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV), as amended by CRR II and CRD V. These standards were retained in the UK regulatory framework via a series of onshoring instruments as part of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. Beyond the minimum standards required by CRR, the PRA has expected the Group, in common with other major UK banks and building societies, to meet a 7% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at the level of the consolidated group since 1 January 2016.\n\nThe Group is also subject to a 'combined buffer requirement' consisting of (i) a capital conservation buffer, and (ii) a countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB). The CCyB is based on rates determined by the regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction in which the Group maintains exposures. In March 2020, the FPC cut the UK CCyB rate to 0% with immediate effect in order to support the supply of credit expected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At its meeting in December 2021, the FPC agreed that it would raise the UK CCyB rate to 1% with effect from 13 December 2022.\n\nAs part of its approach to ring-fencing, the FPC established a framework to apply a firm-specific systemic risk buffer (SRB) which could be set between 0% and 3% of RWAs and which had to be met solely with CET1 capital. The purpose of the SRB was to increase the capacity of ring-fenced bodies, such as Barclays Bank UK PLC, to absorb stress. The buffer rate applicable to the Group's ring-fenced sub-group was set at 1% with effect from August 2019. With the implementation of CRD V, the Other Systemically Important Institutions Buffer (O-SII buffer) replaced the SRB. As part of the implementation of CRD V, the PRA and FPC confirmed that the Barclays Bank UK PLC O-SII buffer would be held at the historic SRB rate of 1% until reassessment in December 2021. On 8 October 2021, the PRA extended the O-SII buffer rate of 1% for a further year, with any future adjustment to the O-SII buffer applicable from January 2024.\n\nThe PRA requires UK firms to hold additional capital to cover risks which the PRA assesses are not fully captured by the Pillar 1 capital requirement. The PRA sets this additional capital requirement (Pillar 2A) at least annually, derived from each firm's individual capital guidance. Under current PRA rules, the Pillar 2A must be met with at least 56.25% CET1 capital and no more than 25% tier 2 capital. In addition, the capital that firms use to meet their minimum requirements (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A) cannot be counted towards meeting the combined buffer requirement.\n\nThe PRA may also impose a 'PRA buffer' to cover risks over a forward looking planning horizon, including with regard to firm-specific stresses or management and governance weaknesses. If the PRA buffer is imposed on a specific firm, it must be met separately to the combined buffer requirement, and must be met fully with CET1 capital.\n\ncla\n\ny",

        "page_content": "S\n\nE\n\nS\n\nG report\n\nShareholder information\n\nRisk review\n\nFinancial review\n\nIn July 2021 and October 2021, the PRA, respectively, published a policy statement and confirmation, setting out its planned implementation of certain Basel III standards, including the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), the new counterparty credit risk standard (SA-CCR) and rules on large exposures. As part of this policy statement, the PRA also confirmed that it would maintain its approach of requiring the deduction of software assets from capital. The PRA will consult shortly on the implementation of the remaining Basel III standards, which include a revised standardised approach for credit risk, the elimination of modelled approaches for certain credit risk exposure categories, a new standardised approach for operational risk, a new market risk approach and the implementation of an output floor requiring reported RWAs calculated under standardised and modelled approaches to be a minimum of 72.5% of fully standardised calculations. The EU has also launched its legislative process for implementing these remaining Basel III reforms. In October 2021, the FPC and PRA published a policy statement setting out changes to the leverage ratio framework, including applying the leverage ratio requirement on an individual basis and making sub-consolidation available as an alternative to individual application where a firm has subsidiaries that can be consolidated.\n\nIn June 2018 and October 2019, the FRB finalised rules regarding single counterparty credit limits (SCCL). The SCCL apply to the largest US BHCs and foreign banks' (including the Group's) US operations. The SCCL creates two separate limits for foreign banks, the first on combined US operations (CUSO) and the second on the US IHC (BUSL). The SCCL for US BHCs, including BUSL, requires that exposure to an unaffiliated counterparty of BUSL not exceed 25% of BUSL's tier 1 capital. With respect to the CUSO, the SCCL rule allows certification to the FRB that a foreign bank complies with comparable home country regulation.\n\nIn the US, in October 2019, the FRB and other US regulatory agencies released final rules to tailor the applicability of prudential requirements for large domestic US banking organisations, foreign banking organisations and their intermediate holding companies (IHCs), including BUSL. BUSL is a 'Category III' IHC. BUSL (and Barclays Bank Delaware) is therefore subject to reduced (calibrated at 85%) standardised liquidity requirements, including the liquidity coverage ratio and NSFR.\n\nBarclays Bank PLC was not required to comply with the CUSO requirement until 1 January 2022, with the first certification applicable for Q1 2022 results.\n\n## Stress testing\n\n## Recovery and Resolution Stabilisation and resolution framework\n\nThe Group and certain of its members are subject to supervisory stress testing exercises in a number of jurisdictions, designed to assess the resilience of banks to adverse economic or financial developments and ensure that they have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for the risks associated with their business profile. Assessment by regulators is on both a quantitative and qualitative basis, the latter focusing on such elements as data provision, stress testing capability including model risk management and internal management processes and controls.\n\nThe UK framework for recovery and resolution was established by the Banking Act 2009, as amended. The EU framework was established by the 2014 Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), as amended by BRRD II.\n\nIn order to enable the exercise of its stabilisation powers, the BoE may impose a temporary stay on the rights of creditors to terminate, accelerate or close out contracts, or override events of default or termination rights that might otherwise be invoked as a result of a resolution action and modify contractual arrangements in certain circumstances (including a variation of the terms of any securities). HM Treasury may also amend the law for the purpose of enabling it to use its powers under this regime effectively, potentially with retrospective effect.\n\nThe BoE, as the UK resolution authority, has the power to resolve a UK financial institution that is failing or likely to fail by exercising several stabilisation options, including transferring such institution's business or securities to a commercial purchaser or a 'bridge bank' owned by the BoE or transferring the institution into temporary public ownership. When exercising any of its stabilisation powers, the BoE must generally provide that shareholders bear first losses, followed by creditors in accordance with the priority of their claims in insolvency.\n\nIn addition, the BoE has the power to permanently write-down, or convert into equity, tier 1 capital instruments, tier 2 capital instruments and internal eligible liabilities at the point of non-viability of the bank.\n\nThe BoE's preferred approach for the resolution of the Group is a bail-in strategy with a single point of entry at Barclays PLC. Under such a strategy, Barclays PLC's subsidiaries would remain operational while Barclays PLC's capital instruments and eligible liabilities would be written down or converted to equity in order to recapitalise the Group and allow for the continued provision of services and operations throughout the resolution. The order in which the bail-in tool is applied reflects the hierarchy of capital instruments under CRD IV and otherwise\n\nrespecting the hierarchy of claims in an ordinary insolvency. Accordingly, the more subordinated the claim, the more likely losses will be suffered by owners of the claim.\n\nUnder the Resolvability Assessment Framework (RAF) firms are required to have in place capabilities covering three resolvability outcomes: (i) adequate financial resources; (ii) being able to continue to do business through resolution and restructuring; and (iii) being able to communicate and co-ordinate within the firm and with authorities. The first self-assessment report on these capabilities was submitted by the Group to the PRA/BoE in 2021 with public disclosures required by both firms and the PRA/ BoE in June 2022 (and every two years thereafter).\n\nThe PRA has made rules that require authorised firms to draw up recovery plans and resolution packs, as required by the BRRD. Recovery plans are designed to outline credible actions that authorised firms could implement in the event of severe stress in order to restore their business to a stable and sustainable condition. Removal of potential impediments to an orderly resolution of a banking group or one or more of its subsidiaries is considered as part of the BoE's and PRA's supervisory strategy for each firm, and the PRA can require firms to make significant changes in order to enhance resolvability. The Group currently provides the PRA with a recovery plan annually and with a resolution pack as requested.\n\nWhile regulators in many jurisdictions have indicated a preference for single point of entry resolution for the Group, additional resolution or bankruptcy provisions may apply to certain Group entities or branches.\n\nIn the US, Title I of the DFA, as amended, and the implementing regulations issued by the FRB and the FDIC require each bank holding company with assets of $250bn or more, including those within the Group, to prepare and submit a plan for the orderly resolution of subsidiaries and operations in the event of future material financial distress or failure. The Group submitted a 'targeted plan' in December 2021. The Group's next submission of the US Resolution Plan in respect of its US operations will be a 'full plan' due in 2024.\n\nIn the US, BUSL is subject to the Orderly Liquidation Authority established by Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA), a regime for the orderly liquidation of systemically important financial institutions by the FDIC, as an alternative to proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the licensing authorities of Barclays Bank PLC New York branch and of Barclays Bank Delaware have the authority to take possession of the business and property of the applicable branch or entity they license and/or to revoke or suspend such licence.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Supervision and regulation continued\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC, as a significant institution under the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR), is subject to the powers of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) as the Eurozone resolution authority. The CBI and the ECB require Barclays Bank Ireland PLC to submit a standalone BRRD-compliant recovery plan on an annual basis. The SRB has the power to require data submissions specific to Barclays Bank Ireland PLC under powers conferred upon it by the BRRD and the SRMR. The SRB will exercise these powers to determine the optimal resolution strategy for Barclays Bank Ireland PLC in the context of the BoE's preferred resolution strategy of single point of entry with bail-in at Barclays PLC. The SRB also has the power under the BRRD and the SRMR to develop a resolution plan for Barclays Bank Ireland PLC.\n\nThe Group is subject to a Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL), which includes a component reflecting the FSB's standards on total loss absorbency capacity (TLAC).\n\n## TLAC and MREL\n\nThe MREL requirements were fully implemented by 1 January 2022, at which time G-SIBs with resolution entities incorporated in the UK will be required to meet an MREL equivalent to the higher of: (i) two times the sum of their Pillar 1 and Pillar 2A requirements; or (ii) the higher of two times their leverage ratio or 6.75% of leverage exposures. Internal MREL for operating subsidiaries is subject to a scalar in the 75-90% range of the external requirement that would apply to the subsidiary if it were a resolution entity. The starting point for the scalar is 90% for ring-fenced bank sub-groups.\n\nIn the US, the FRB's TLAC rule includes provisions that require BUSL to have: (i) a specified outstanding amount of eligible long-term debt; (ii) a specified outstanding amount of TLAC (consisting of common and preferred equity regulatory capital plus eligible long-term debt); and (iii) a specified common equity buffer. In addition, the FRB's TLAC rule prohibits BUSL, for so long as the Group's overall resolution plan treats BUSL as a non-resolution entity, from issuing TLAC to entities other than those within the Group.\n\nBarclays Bank Ireland PLC is subject to the SRB's MREL policy, as issued in May 2021, in respect of the internal MREL that it will be required to issue to the Group. The SRB's current calibration of internal MREL for non-resolution entities is expressed as two ratios that have to be met in parallel: (a) two times the sum of: (i) the firm's Pillar 1 requirement; (ii) its Pillar 2 requirement; and (b) two times the leverage ratio. The SRB's policy does not envisage the application of any scalar in respect of the internal MREL requirement.\n\n## Bank Levy and FSCS\n\nIn addition, the UK has a statutory compensation fund called the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), which is funded by way of annual levies on most authorised financial services firms.\n\nThe BRRD established a requirement for EU member states to set up a pre-funded resolution financing arrangement with funding equal to 1% of covered deposits by 31 December 2024 to cover the costs of bank resolutions. The UK has implemented this requirement by way of a tax on the balance sheets of banks known as the 'Bank Levy'.\n\n## Structural reform\n\nUS regulation places further substantive limits on the activities that may be conducted by banks and holding companies, including foreign banking organisations such as the Group. The 'Volcker Rule', which was part of the DFA and which came into effect in the US in 2015, prohibits banking entities from undertaking certain proprietary trading activities and limits such entities' ability to sponsor or invest in certain private equity funds and hedge funds (in each case broadly defined). As required by the rule, the Group has developed and implemented an extensive compliance and monitoring programme addressing proprietary trading and covered fund activities (both inside and outside of the US).\n\nIn the UK, the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 put in place a framework for ring-fencing certain operations of large banks. Ring-fencing requires, among other things, the separation of the retail and smaller deposittaking business activities of UK banks into a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity, which is not permitted to undertake a range of activities.\n\n## Market infrastructure regulation\n\nThe European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) has introduced requirements designed to improve transparency and reduce the risks associated with the derivatives market. EMIR has potential operational and financial impacts on the Group, including by imposing new collateral requirements on a broader range of market participants from 2022. If not extended, the EU's equivalence decision for UK Central Clearing\n\nIn recent years, regulators as well as globalstandard setting bodies such as the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have focused on improving transparency and reducing risk in markets, particularly risks related to over-thecounter (OTC) transactions. This focus has resulted in a variety of new regulations across the G20 countries and beyond that require or encourage on-venue trading, clearing, posting of margin and disclosure of pre-trade and post-trade information.\n\nCounterparties (CCPs), and exemption for certain intragroup transactions from the EMIR derivatives clearing and margin obligations, both due to expire at the end of June 2022, could also have operational and financial impacts on the Group.\n\nThe EU Regulation on Sustainability-Related Disclosures introduces disclosure obligations requiring financial institutions to explain how they integrate environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions for certain financial products. In addition, the EU Taxonomy Regulation provides for a general framework for the development of an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. In the UK, the FCA has announced that the UK Green Taxonomy Technical Screening Criteria will be finalised by the end of 2022. Reporting against the Taxonomy will form part of the UK's new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR). Certain companies will be required to disclose which portion of their activities are Taxonomyaligned. The structure of the Taxonomy draws on the EU approach and has six environmental objectives (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity). The UK regulators are also consulting on a new SDR Framework for firms as well as investment product disclosures, including a new sustainable investment labelling regime.\n\nThe Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (collectively referred to as MiFID II) have affected many of the markets in which the Group operates, the instruments in which it trades and the way it transacts with market counterparties and other customers. MiFID II is currently undergoing a review process in both the EU and the UK, including as part of the EU's ongoing focus on the development of a stronger Capital Markets Union and the UK's Wholesale Markets Review.\n\nThe EU and UK Benchmarks Regulation apply to the administration, contribution and use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK, respectively. Financial institutions within the EU or the UK, as applicable, are prohibited from using benchmarks unless their administrators are authorised, registered or otherwise recognised in the EU or the UK, respectively. The FCA has stated that it does not intend to support LIBOR after the end of 2021. Global regulators in conjunction with the industry have developed and are continuing to develop alternative benchmarks and risk-free rate fallback arrangements, including updates to existing, as well as new, applicable legislation.",

        "page_content": "US regulators have imposed similar rules as the EU with respect to the mandatory on-venue trading and clearing of certain derivatives, and post-trade transparency, as well as in relation to the margining of OTC derivatives. US regulators have finalised certain aspects of their rules with respect to their application on a cross-border basis, including with respect to their registration requirements in relation to non-US swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. The regulators may adopt further rules, or provide further guidance, regarding cross-border applicability. In December 2017, the CFTC and the European Commission recognised the trading venues of each other's jurisdiction to allow market participants to comply with mandatory on-venue trading requirements while trading on certain venues recognised by the other jurisdiction. In November 2021, the CFTC extended temporary relief that would permit trading venues and market participants located in the UK to continue to rely on this mutual recognition framework following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.\n\nAccordingly, Barclays Bank PLC is subject to CFTC rules on business conduct, recordkeeping and reporting and to FRB rules on capital and margin. The CFTC has approved certain comparability determinations that permit substituted compliance with non-US regulatory regimes for certain swap regulations. Substituted compliance is permitted for certain transaction-level requirements, where applicable, only with respect to transactions between a non-US swap dealer and certain non-US counterparties, whereas entity-level determinations generally apply on an entitywide basis regardless of counterparty status. In November 2021, the CFTC extended temporary relief that would permit swap dealers located in the UK to continue to rely on existing CFTC substituted compliance determinations with respect to EU requirements in the event of a withdrawal of the UK from the EU. In July 2020 the CFTC adopted no-action relief from\n\nCertain participants in US swap markets are required to register with the CFTC as 'swap dealers' or 'major swap participants' and with the SEC as 'security-based swap dealers' or 'major security-based swap participants'. Such registrants are subject to CFTC and SEC regulation and oversight. Entities required to register as swap dealers and security-based swap dealers are subject to business conduct, record-keeping and reporting requirements under both CFTC and SEC rules. Barclays Bank PLC is also subject to regulation by the FRB, and is both provisionally registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer and conditionally registered with the SEC as a security-based swap dealer.\n\napplication of CFTC transaction level requirements to transactions between a non-US swap dealer and a non-US counterparty that are 'arranged, negotiated or executed' by personnel of the swap dealer or its agent in the US. The final rules also codify certain aspects of the CFTC's current cross-border framework with respect to internal and external business conduct requirements.\n\n## Other regulation\n\nAs of 1 November 2021, Barclays Bank PLC became conditionally registered as a securitybased swap dealer with the SEC and subject to SEC rules on business conduct, recordkeeping and reporting, similar to the CFTC rules noted above. The SEC approved certain comparability determinations that permit conditional substituted compliance with non-US regulatory regimes for certain security-based swap regulations. Due to the conditionality of the determinations Barclays Bank PLC is relying on substituted compliance only with respect to a few entity-wide regulations. Many of the regulations under the CFTC and SEC regimes are complementary, however, the SEC does require non-US security-based swap dealers to comply with certain SEC rules in connection with transactions that are 'arranged, negotiated or executed' from the US expanding the scope and impact of the SEC regime to transactions with a greater number of non-US counterparties. As noted above, Barclays Bank PLC is subject to FRB rules on capital and margin.\n\n## Consumer protection, culture, and diversity and inclusion\n\nOur regulators have enhanced their focus on the promotion of cultural values as a key area for banks, although they generally view the responsibility for reforming culture as primarily sitting with the industry. The UK regulators have also begun focusing on diversity and inclusion in financial services firms, with the Bank of England, PRA and FCA having published a joint discussion paper and the FCA having published a consultation paper on this topic in July 2021.\n\nIn May 2021, the FCA published a consultation paper proposing the imposition of a new consumer duty on firms. The duty looks to set higher expectations for the standard of care that firms provide to customers and will impact all aspects of Barclays' retail businesses, including every customer journey, product and service as well as our relationships with partners, suppliers and third parties. This will result in significant implementation costs and there will also be higher ongoing costs for the industry as a result of extensive monitoring and evidential requirements. Final rules are due to be published by July 2022.\n\n## Data protection and PSD2\n\nThe EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) created a broadly harmonised privacy regime across EU member states, introducing mandatory breach notification, enhanced individual rights, a need to openly demonstrate compliance, and significant penalties for breaches. The extraterritorial effect of the GDPR means entities established outside the EU may fall within the Regulation's ambit when offering goods or services to European based customers or clients. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK continues to apply the GDPR framework (as onshored into UK law and hence now referred to as the 'UK GDPR' - this sits alongside an amended version of the UK Data Protection Act 2018). The GDPR has become the global touchstone as countries around the world either usher in or contemplate similar data privacy laws, or align their existing legislation. In 2020, the European Court of Justice (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield as a mechanism for transferring EU personal data to the US and placed additional requirements on the use of standard contractual clauses (SCCs) for transfers of personal information to third countries. In 2021, the European Commission published new SCCs to meet the requirements of GDPR and the CJEU decision, known as Schrems II. Implementing the new SCCs, which involve case-by-case transfer impact assessments and other safeguards, is likely to result in increased compliance costs for the Group. During 2020 and 2021 new privacy laws were passed in Switzerland, took effect in Brazil, Mainland China and Dubai, and were proposed in India. Noncompliance with any of these requirements could lead to regulatory fines and other penalties.\n\nMost countries where the Group operates have comprehensive laws requiring openness and transparency about the collection and use of personal information, and protection against loss and unauthorised or improper access. Regulations regarding data protection are increasing in number, as well as levels of enforcement, as manifested in increased amounts of fines and the severity of other penalties. We expect that personal privacy and data protection will continue to receive attention and focus from regulators, as well as public scrutiny and attention.",

        "page_content": "## Risk review\n\n## Supervision and regulation continued\n\nIn the US, Barclays US Consumer Bank is subject to the US Federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which came into effect on 1 January 2020 (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act which was passed in November 2020 (CPRA) and will take effect in January 2023 with respect to data collected as early as January 2022. The GLBA limits the use and disclosure of non-public personal information to non-affiliated third parties and requires financial institutions to provide written notice of their privacy policies and practices and implement certain information security policies and practices. Any violations of the GLBA could subject the US Consumer Bank to additional reporting requirements or regulatory investigation or audits by the financial regulators. The CCPA applies to personal information that is not collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA, and it requires the US Consumer Bank to provide California consumers (as defined in the law) with additional disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of personal information, and grants California consumers access, deletion, and other rights with respect to their personal information, including the right to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of such personal information. The CCPA subjects the US Consumer Bank to enforcement penalties by the Attorney General of the State of California, and grants a private right of action with respect to certain data breaches. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, including by imposing additional obligations on covered companies and expanding consumers' rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, and creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce both the CCPA and the CPRA, potentially resulting in further uncertainty in the interpretation and enforcement of both laws. In addition, all 50 states have laws including obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, state officers and others.\n\nFrom 2019, new rules apply under the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that affect the way banks and other payment services providers check that the person requesting access to an account or trying to make a payment is permitted to do so. This is referred to as strong customer authentication (SCA). The deadline for implementing SCA for e-commerce has been extended by the FCA to 14 March 2022.\n\nIn addition, in May 2020, the National People's Congress of the PRC approved the PRC Civil Code, which took effect on 1 January 2021. Pursuant to the PRC Civil Code, the collection, storage, use, process, transmission, provision and disclosure of personal information shall follow the principles of legitimacy, properness and necessity.\n\n## Cyber security and operational resilience\n\nThe regulatory focus has been further heightened by the increasing number of high-profile ransomware and other supply chain attacks seen across the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is evidenced by the continuing publication of proposed laws and changes to regulatory frameworks globally. For example, legislation has been introduced in the US that aims to expand cyber security notification requirements for critical infrastructure, whilst in the UK a new framework for operational resilience focused on the identification of, and setting impact tolerances for, important business services came into effect in March 2021. In 2022, the European Union's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is expected to introduce comprehensive and sector specific regulation on ICT incident reporting, testing and third party risk management, and provide for direct oversight of critical third party ICT providers servicing the EU financial services sector. However, such measures are likely to result in increased technology and compliance costs for the Group.\n\nRegulators in the UK, the EU and the US continue to focus on cyber security risk management, organisational operational resilience and overall soundness across all financial services firms, with customer and market expectations of continuous access to financial services remaining at an all-time high.\n\n## Sanctions and financial crime\n\nof corporate criminal liability focused broadly on a company's failure to prevent bribery on its behalf. The Criminal Finances Act 2017 introduced new corporate criminal offences of failing to prevent the facilitation of UK and overseas tax evasion. Both pieces of legislation have broad application and in certain circumstances may have extraterritorial impact on entities, persons or activities located outside the UK, including Barclays PLC's subsidiaries outside the UK. The UK Bribery Act requires the Group to have adequate procedures to prevent bribery which, due to the extraterritorial nature of the Act, makes this both complex and costly. Additionally, the Criminal Finances Act requires the Group to have reasonable prevention procedures in place to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by persons acting for, or on behalf of, the Group.\n\nThe UK Bribery Act 2010 introduced a new form\n\nThe Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act became law in the UK in 2018. The Act allows for the adoption of an autonomous UK sanctions regime, as well as a more flexible licensing regime post-Brexit. On 6 July 2020, the UK Government announced the first sanctions that have been implemented independently by the UK outside the auspices of the UN and EU. The autonomous UK sanctions regime came into force on 1 January 2021. The sanctions apply within the UK and in relation to the conduct of all UK persons wherever they are in the world; they also apply to overseas branches of UK companies.\n\nIn some cases, US state and federal regulations addressing sanctions, money laundering and other financial crimes may impact entities, persons or activities located or undertaken outside the US, including Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries. US government authorities have aggressively enforced these laws against financial institutions in recent years. Failure of a financial institution to ensure compliance with such laws could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the institution.\n\nIn the US, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act 2001, the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 and regulations thereunder contain numerous anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing requirements for financial institutions. In addition, the Group is subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits, among other things, corrupt payments to foreign government officials. It is also subject to various economic sanctions laws, regulations and executive orders administered by the US government, which prohibit or restrict some or all business activities and other dealings with or involving certain individuals, entities, groups, countries and territories.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nIn assessing the financial performance of the Group, management uses a range of KPIs which focus on the Group's financial strength, the delivery of sustainable returns and cost management. Barclays continues to target RoTE of greater than 10% over the medium term. Cost discipline remains a priority and management continues to target a cost: income ratio below 60%.\n\nDefinition\n\nWhy is it important and how the Group performed\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio\n\nCET1 ratio is a measure of capital that is predominantly common equity defined by the CRR, as retained in the UK regulatory framework through on-shoring instruments as part of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and amended by CRR II with effect from 1 January 2022.\n\nCapital requirements are part of the regulatory framework governing how banks and depository institutions are supervised. Capital ratios express a bank's capital as a percentage of its RWAs as defined by the PRA.\n\n## Return on average tangible shareholders' equity\n\nRoTE is calculated as profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders, as a proportion of average shareholders' equity excluding non-controlling interests and other equity instruments adjusted for the deduction of intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nThe Group's capital management objective is to maximise shareholder value by prudently managing the level and mix of its capital to: ensure the Group and all of its subsidiaries are appropriately capitalised relative to their regulatory minimum and stressed capital requirements, support the Group's risk appetite, growth and strategic options, while seeking to maintain a robust credit proposition for the Group and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Group target: a CET1 ratio in the range of 13-14%.\n\nThe CET1 ratio was stable at 15.1% (2020: 15.1%). CET1 capital increased by \u00a31.2bn to \u00a347.5bn as profit before tax of \u00a38.4bn was partially offset by share buybacks, 2021 dividends and equity coupons paid and foreseen, as well as pensions deficit contribution payments. RWAs increased \u00a37.9bn to \u00a3314.1bn primarily resulting from the recalibration of the modelled market risk stress period, increased client and trading activity within CIB and growth in mortgages within Barclays UK, partially offset by lower unsecured balances.\n\nThis measure indicates the return generated by the management of the business based on shareholders' tangible equity. Achieving a target RoTE demonstrates the organisation's ability to execute its strategy and align management's interests with the shareholders'. RoTE lies at the heart of the Group's capital allocation and performance management process.\n\n## Group target: RoTE of greater than 10%.\n\nRoTE for the Group was 13.4% (2020: 3.2%) due to record profit before tax including a net credit impairment release and increased income, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\nRoTE based on a CET1 ratio of 13.5%, excluding litigation and conduct, structural cost actions and the re-measurement of UK DTA's was 15.3% (2020: 4.4%) a . A CET1 ratio of 13.5% is used, which is the mid-point of the target range of 13%-14%.\n\n## Non-IFRS performance measures\n\nThe Group's management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance between financial periods, and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group.\n\nThey also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by management. However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well. Refer to the non-IFRS performance measures section for further information and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this section and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup RoTE\n\n2020: 3.2% 2019: 5.3%\n\n13.4%",

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\n## Income statement commentary\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020 a\n\nTotal income increased to \u00a321,940m (2020: \u00a321,766m). Barclays UK income increased 3%. Barclays International income decreased 2%, with CIB income down 1% and CC&P income down 3%. Excluding the impact of the 8% depreciation of average USD against GBP, total income was up, reflecting Barclays' diversified income streams.\n\nBarclays' diversified business model delivered a record profit before tax of \u00a38,414m (2020: \u00a33,065m), RoTE of 13.4% (2020: 3.2%) and earnings per share (EPS) of 37.5p (2020: 8.8p).\n\nCredit impairment net release of \u00a3653m (2020: \u00a34,838m charge). The net release included a reversal of \u00a31.3bn in non-default charges, primarily reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook. Excluding this reversal, the charge was \u00a30.7bn, reflecting reduced unsecured lending balances and low delinquency. Economic uncertainty adjustments have been maintained firstly in respect of customers and clients who may be more vulnerable to the withdrawal of support schemes and emerging economic uncertainty, and secondly, model uncertainty which does not capture certain macroeconomic and risk parameter uncertainties. The reduction in unsecured lending balances and growth in secured balances have contributed to a decrease in the Group's loan coverage ratio to 1.6% (December 2020: 2.4%). Coverage ratios in unsecured loan portfolios remained elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\n\n## Note\n\n- a The 8% depreciation of average USD against GBP adversely impacted income and profits and positively impacted total operating expenses.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 4% to \u00a314,439m, due to structural cost actions of \u00a3648m primarily relating to the real estate review in Q221 and Barclays UK transformation costs in Q421, higher performance costs that reflect improved returns, and continued investment and business growth. This was partially offset by the benefit from the depreciation of average USD against GBP, efficiency savings and a lower UK bank levy charge, primarily due to the reduced rate. This resulted in a cost: income ratio of 66% (2020: 64%). Excluding structural cost actions of \u00a3648m (2020: \u00a3368m), operating expenses would have been \u00a313,791m (2020: \u00a313,518m), resulting in a cost: income ratio of 63% (2020: 62%).\n\nAttributable profit was \u00a36,375m (2020: \u00a31,526m).\n\nThe effective tax rate was 14.1% (2020: 19.7%). This reflects a \u00a3462m tax benefit recognised for the re-measurement of the Group's UK deferred tax assets (DTAs) as a result of the enactment in 2021 of a UK corporation tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective from 1 April 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\n## Balance sheet commentary\n\n## Total assets\n\nCash and balances at central banks increased by \u00a347bn to \u00a3239bn, predominantly driven by strong growth in customer deposits. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income decreased \u00a317bn to \u00a362bn.\n\nTotal assets increased \u00a335bn to \u00a31,384bn.\n\nDerivative financial instrument assets decreased \u00a340bn to \u00a3263bn, driven by an increase in major interest rate curves. Cash collateral and settlement balances decreased by \u00a39bn to \u00a393bn, predominantly due to reduced derivative balances.\n\nTrading portfolio assets increased \u00a319bn to \u00a3147bn due to increased client activity and financial assets at fair value through the income statement increased \u00a317bn to \u00a3192bn due to reverse repurchase agreements and similar secured lending.\n\nLoans and advances at amortised cost increased \u00a319bn to \u00a3361bn, which reflected increased lending across Barclays UK and Barclays International, including \u00a310bn of mortgage growth.\n\n## Total liabilities\n\nDeposits at amortised cost increased \u00a338bn to \u00a3519bn primarily due to  clients increasing liquidity, and lower consumer spending levels.\n\nTotal liabilities increased \u00a331bn to \u00a31,314bn.\n\nDerivative financial instrument liabilities decreased \u00a344bn to \u00a3257bn, driven by an increase in major interest rate curves. This is consistent with the movement in derivative financial instrument assets. Cash collateral and settlement balances decreased by \u00a36bn to \u00a379bn predominantly due to reduced mark-tomarket balances.\n\nTrading portfolio liabilities increased \u00a37bn due to increased client activity to \u00a354bn and financial liabilities designated at fair value increased \u00a31bn to \u00a3251bn due to repurchase agreements and similar secured borrowing.\n\n## Total shareholders' equity\n\nOther equity instruments increased \u00a31.1bn to \u00a312.3bn due to the issuance of a $1.5bn AT1 instrument. AT1 securities are perpetual subordinated contingent convertible securities structured to qualify as AT1 instruments under prevailing capital rules applicable as at the relevant issue date.\n\nTotal shareholders' equity increased \u00a33.3bn to \u00a370.2bn.\n\nOther reserves decreased by \u00a32.7bn, mainly due to a reduction in the cash flow hedging reserve of \u00a32.4bn to \u00a30.9bn debit, as a result of fair value movements on interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes due to an increase in major interest rate curves.\n\nTangible net asset value per share increased 23p to 292p as 38p earnings per share were offset by net negative reserve movements of 15p.\n\nRetained earnings increased \u00a35.1bn to \u00a350.7bn, mainly due to profits of \u00a36.4bn, offset by share repurchases of \u00a31.2bn and dividends of \u00a30.5bn.",

Net interest income reduced 1% to \u00a35,202m with a net interest margin of 2.52% (2020: 2.61%) as strong customer retention and improved margins in mortgages were more than offset by lower unsecured lending balances. Net fee, commission and other income increased 20% to \u00a31,334m, returning back towards pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\n\nProfit before tax increased to \u00a32,471m (2020: \u00a3546m). RoTE was 17.6% (2020: 3.2%) reflecting an improving UK operating environment.\n\nPersonal Banking income increased 10% to \u00a33,883m, reflecting strong growth in mortgages, alongside improved margins during the first three quarters, balance growth in deposits and the non-recurrence of COVID-19 customer support actions. This was partially offset by deposit margin compression from lower interest rates and lower unsecured lending balances.\n\nBarclaycard Consumer UK income decreased 18% to \u00a31,250m, as repayments by customers and reduced borrowing resulted in a lower level of IEL balances. However, IEL balances began to stabilise throughout the second half of 2021.\n\nBusiness Banking income increased 7% to \u00a31,403m due to lending and deposit balance growth from \u00a312.1bn of government scheme lending and the non-recurrence of COVID-19 and related customer support actions, partially offset by deposit margin compression from lower interest rates.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 2% to \u00a34,430m primarily reflecting increased investment spend, including structural cost actions of \u00a3288m (2020: \u00a3150m). Excluding structural cost actions, operating expenses would have been broadly stable at \u00a34,142m (2020: \u00a34,202m), with higher operational and customer service costs, primarily driven by increased volumes, offset by efficiency savings.\n\nLoans and advances to customers at amortised cost increased 2% to \u00a3208.8bn predominantly from \u00a39.9bn of mortgage growth following a strong flow of new applications as well as strong customer retention. This was offset by a \u00a32.2bn decrease in the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio carrying value as interest rate yield curves steepened, \u00a31.6bn lower unsecured lending balances and \u00a31.3bn lower Business Banking balances as repayment of government scheme lending commences.\n\nRWAs decreased to \u00a372.3bn (December 2020: \u00a373.7bn) driven by a reduction in unsecured lending and the value of the ESHLA portfolio, partially offset by growth in mortgages.\n\nCustomer deposits at amortised cost increased 8% to \u00a3260.6bn reflecting an increase of \u00a316.7bn and \u00a33.5bn in Personal Banking and Business Banking respectively, further strengthening the liquidity position and contributing to a loan: deposit ratio of 85% (December 2020: 89%).\n\nCredit impairment net release of \u00a3365m (2020: \u00a31,467m charge) was driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook and lower unsecured lending balances due to customer repayments and lower delinquencies. As at 31 December 2021, 30 and 90 day arrears rates in UK cards were 1.0% (Q420: 1.7%) and 0.2% (Q420: 0.8%) respectively.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nThe 8% depreciation of average USD against GBP adversely impacted income and profits and positively impacted total operating expenses.\n\nProfit before tax increased 84% to \u00a36,658m with a RoTE of 14.9% (2020: 7.1%), reflecting a RoTE of 14.9% (2020: 9.5%) in CIB and 15.0% (2020: (7.5)%) in CC&P.\n\nTotal income decreased to \u00a315,665m (2020: \u00a315,921m).\n\nGlobal Markets income decreased 16% to \u00a36,415m as a strong performance in Equities, representing the best full year on a comparable basis a , was more than offset by FICC. Equities income increased 20% to \u00a32,967m driven by strong client activity in derivatives and increased client balances in financing. FICC income decreased 33% to \u00a33,448m due to tighter spreads and the non-recurrence of prior year client activity levels.\n\nCIB income decreased 1% to \u00a312,334m.\n\nInvestment Banking fees income, representing the best full year on a comparable basis a , increased 34% to \u00a33,659m driven by a strong performance in Advisory and Equity capital markets reflecting an increase in the fee pool and an increased market share b .\n\nCC&P income decreased 3% to \u00a33,331m.\n\nWithin Corporate, Transaction banking income increased 8% to \u00a31,672m driven by deposits and higher payments volumes. Corporate lending income was stable at \u00a3588m (2020: \u00a3590m) driven by a current year fair value loan write-off on a single name and increased cost of hedging, whilst the prior year included net losses from the mark-to-market of lending and related hedge positions.\n\nInternational Cards and Consumer Bank income decreased 14% to \u00a32,092m reflecting lower average cards balances whilst balances increased during the second half of 2021.\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Data source: Dealogic for the period covering 1 January to 31 December 2021.\n- a Period covering 2014 - 2021. Pre 2014 financials were not restated following re-segmentation in 2016.\n\nPrivate Bank income increased 10% to \u00a3781m, reflecting client balance growth and a gain on a property sale.\n\nCredit impairment net release of \u00a3288m (2020: \u00a33,280m charge) was driven by an improved macroeconomic outlook. CIB credit impairment net release of \u00a3473m (2020: \u00a31,559m charge) was also supported by net single name wholesale loan releases and a benign credit environment. CC&P credit impairment charge of \u00a3185m (2020: \u00a31,721m) was partially driven by lower delinquencies and higher customer repayments. As at 31 December 2021, 30 and 90 day arrears in US cards were 1.6% (Q420: 2.5%) and 0.8% (Q420: 1.4%) respectively.\n\nUnified Payments income increased 50% to \u00a3458m driven by the non-recurrence of a c.\u00a3100m valuation loss on Barclays' preference shares in Visa Inc. in Q220, which have subsequently been fully disposed of in FY21, and merchant acquiring turnover growth following the easing of lockdown restrictions.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 3% to \u00a39,335m. CIB total operating expenses increased 1% to \u00a36,963m due to higher performance costs, that reflect an improvement in returns, partly offset by a lower bank levy charge, primarily due to the reduced rate. CC&P total operating expenses increased 11% to \u00a32,372m driven by the impact of higher investment spend, including an increase in marketing and costs for existing and new partnerships, and customer remediation costs related to a legacy portfolio.\n\nTrading portfolio assets increased \u00a319.2bn to \u00a3146.9bn predominantly due to increased activity in Equities.\n\nLoans and advances at amortised cost increased \u00a311.1bn to \u00a3133.8bn due to increased lending across CIB and CC&P.\n\nDerivative financial instruments assets decreased \u00a340.3bn and liabilities decreased \u00a344.0bn to \u00a3261.5bn and \u00a3256.4bn respectively, driven by an increase in major interest rate curves and reduced client activity in FICC.\n\nCash collateral and settlement balances decreased \u00a39.4bn to \u00a388.1bn.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through the income statement increased \u00a317.5bn to \u00a3188.2bn driven by increased secured lending.\n\nDeposits at amortised cost increased \u00a318.3bn to \u00a3258.8bn due to clients increasing liquidity.\n\nRWAs increased to \u00a3230.9bn (December 2020: \u00a3222.3bn) primarily resulting from the recalibration of the modelled market risk stress period, and increased client and trading activity within CIB.",

Head Office average allocated tangible equity represents the difference between the Group's average tangible shareholders' equity and the amounts allocated to businesses.\n\n|                                     | Profit/(loss)  attributable to  ordinary equity  holders of the  parent \u00a3m   | Average   tangible   equity   | Return on  average  tangible   equity   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| For the year ended 31 December 2021 |                                                                              | \u00a3bn                           | %                                       |\n| Barclays UK                         | 1,756                                                                        | 10.0                          | 17.6                                    |\n| Corporate and Investment Bank       | 4,202                                                                        | 28.3                          | 14.9                                    |\n| Consumer, Cards and Payments        | 615                                                                          | 4.1                           | 15.0                                    |\n| Barclays International              | 4,817                                                                        | 32.4                          | 14.9                                    |\n| Head Office                         | (198)                                                                        | 5.0                           | n/m                                     |\n| Barclays Group                      | 6,375                                                                        | 47.4                          | 13.4                                    |\n| For the year ended 31 December 2020 |                                                                              |                               |                                         |\n| Barclays UK                         | 325                                                                          | 10.1                          | 3.2                                     |\n| Corporate and Investment Bank       | 2,554                                                                        | 27.0                          | 9.5                                     |\n| Consumer, Cards and Payments        | (334)                                                                        | 4.5                           | (7.5)                                   |\n| Barclays International              | 2,220                                                                        | 31.5                          | 7.1                                     |\n| Head Office                         | (1,019)                                                                      | 6.7                           | n/m                                     |\n| Barclays Group                      | 1,526                                                                        | 48.3                          | 3.2                                     |\n| For the year ended 31 December 2019 |                                                                              |                               |                                         |\n| Barclays UK                         | 281                                                                          | 10.3                          | 2.7                                     |\n| Corporate and Investment Bank       | 1,980                                                                        | 25.9                          | 7.6                                     |\n| Consumer, Cards and Payments        | 836                                                                          | 5.3                           | 15.8                                    |\n| Barclays International              | 2,816                                                                        | 31.2                          | 9.0                                     |\n| Head Office                         | (636)                                                                        | 5.1                           | n/m                                     |\n| Barclays Group                      | 2,461                                                                        | 46.6                          | 5.3                                     |",

Our responsibilities are described below.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.  Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with discussions with and our report to the Board Audit Committee.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\nFollowing our FY20 audit, and considering developments affecting the Barclays PLC Group since then, we have updated our risk assessment.\n\n## Factors driving our view of risks\n\nThe macro-economic environment has demonstrated resilience during the emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic. This has contributed to a reduction in expected credit loss ('ECL') provisions compared to 2020. Income in the markets business has fallen versus the prior year due to tighter spreads and a lower volume of customer transactions while improved capital market activity contributed to increase fee income. The low interest rate environment and changes in portfolio mix have continued to impact interest margins in Barclays Bank UK.\n\nGiven the improvement in the economic environment the risk around the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets has reduced and this has been removed as a Key Audit Matter. Similarly, our assessment is that the risk of recoverability of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries has reduced, although this remains as a Key Audit Matter for the Parent Company.\n\nAs part of our risk assessment, we have maintained our focus on future economic assumptions used by the Group in estimates such as ECL and the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation. We have also maintained our focus on the post model adjustments used in the determination of the ECL provisions and on the valuation of financial instruments held at fair value.\n\nAs a result of the improved macro-economic outlook and reduced market volatility, the risks relating to the valuation of certain property and private equity assets of the defined benefit obligation scheme has reduced and this has been removed from the Key Audit Matter relating to the valuation of the UK pension scheme. The reduction in risk is largely due to lower volatility.\n\n| Key Audit Matters                                               | Item   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Impairment allowance on loans  and advance at amortised cost    |        |\n| Valuation of financial  instruments held at fair value          |        |\n| UK Pension scheme valuation                                     |        |\n| User access management                                          |        |\n| Recoverability of Parent  Company's investment in  subsidiaries |        |\n\nSimilar risk to FY20\n\n## Our use of specialists and innovation\n\nDecreased risk since FY20\n\nUsing the work of specialists and specific team members with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or auditing: We used our specialists and specific team members with expertise in a specialised area of accounting or auditing to assist us in various aspects of our audit. This includes, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 Economics specialists for our work related to the macro economic variables and scenarios used in the determination of the ECL provisions\n- \u25a0 Credit risk modellers for our testing of the ECL models\n- \u25a0 Valuation specialists for our independent repricing of samples of financial instruments\n- \u25a0 Actuarial pensions specialists for our work on the valuation of the defined benefit obligation\n- \u25a0 Corporate finance valuation specialists for our work over the methodology underpinning and certain of the assumptions used in the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangibles\n\nIncorporating unpredictability into our audit: A requirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management. As an example, we performed audit procedures over Private Bank and Overseas Services ('PBOS') deposit and loans and advances balances in different locations, including Monaco and Switzerland in the current year.\n\ncla\n\ny",

KPMG is invited to attend all BAC meetings and is provided an opportunity to meet with the BAC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the BAC in section 4 and have highlighted those matters that required particular judgement.\n\n## Board audit committee ('BAC') interaction\n\nIn addition, our audit team includes a senior partner who has specific responsibility for ensuring audit quality (our 'Audit Quality partner'). The Board Audit Committee met with the Audit Quality Partner, without the audit team present, to receive a report on his assessment of audit quality.\n\n## Our independence\n\nThe matters included in the BAC Chair's report on page 133 are consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 December 2017.

For FY20 we normalised this benchmark upward by \u00a32.1bn to adjust for the identified impact of COVID-19 on the ECL charge.\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3225m (FY20: \u00a3225m).

The outputs from these hubs are included in the financial information of the reporting components and so the India operations are not considered to be a separate component.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic we actively built a virtual communication and oversight strategy between the Group audit team and the components and certain other participating locations and this approach has continued in the current year with limited physical visits to overseas components. Further details are set out in section 7.\n\nWe have performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, set out in more detail in Section 7. In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as agreed with the Board Audit Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n## Group total income a 92%\n\n(2020: 92%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group total assets a 97%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2020: 94%)\n\n## Note\n\n97%\n\n- a Percentage of Group total income/assets over which we performed full scope audit or audit of account balances\n\n## The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nClimate change risks, opportunities and the Group's own commitments and changing regulations could have a significant impact on the Group's business and operations. There is the possibility that climate change risks, both physical and transitional, could affect financial statement balances, through estimates such as credit risk and market risk. There is enhanced narrative in the Annual Report on climate matters.\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of risks arising from climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements. The Group has set out its ambition under the Paris Accord to be a net zero bank by 2050.  Further information is provided in the Group's Environment, Social and Governance report which has been incorporated into the 2021 Annual Report on pages 51-104.\n\nAs part of our audit we performed a risk assessment of the impact of climate change risk and the commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change on the financial statement and our audit approach. As a part of this we held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. In doing this we performed the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Understanding management's processes: we made enquiries to understand management's assessment of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group's Annual Report and Accounts and the Group's preparedness for this. As a part of this we made enquiries to understand management's risk assessment process as it relates to possible effects of climate change on the Annual Report and Accounts including the way in which the accounting policies of the bank are updated to reflect climate change risks.\n- \u25a0 Corporate credit risk: We assessed how the Group considers the impact of climate risk on corporate counterparties through our individual loans assessments where, for performing counterparties, we assessed how climate change risk impacts certain counterparties within the commercial and investment bank, including the impact on their credit rating as applicable. The focus of our procedures was on certain counterparties who operate in industries with greater exposure to credit risk - the energy, transportation, materials and buildings, agriculture, food and forest product sectors\n- \u25a0 Retail credit risk: We assessed how the Group considers the impact of physical risks on the valuation of mortgage collateral. Specifically, we performed data and analytic driven risk assessment procedures to understand the potential impact of flooding and subsidence on the valuation of mortgage collateral and made enquiries of management to understand how this is considered within their own collateral valuation process. We also considered the potential credit risk impact of the tightening of Energy Performance Certificate ('EPC') requirements on buy-to-let portfolios.\n- \u25a0 Market risk: we incorporated a consideration of the climate change impact on unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain financial instruments in elevated risk sectors including energy, metals and mining.\n- \u25a0 Annual report narrative: We made enquiries of management to understand the process by which climate related narrative is developed including the primary sources of data used and the governance process in place over the narrative. As a part of our risk assessment, we read the climate related information in the front half of the Annual Report and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n- \u25a0 Stress testing: We inspected the climate stress testing performed by the Group which applied the Bank of England's 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nOn the basis of the procedures performed above, we concluded that, while climate change posed a risk to the determination of asset values in the current year, the risk was not significant when we considered the nature of the assets and relevant contractual terms. As a result, there was no material impact from this on our key audit matters.\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Parent Company or the Group or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the Parent Company's and the Group's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group and Parent Company, the financial services industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to the business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Parent Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that management considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources over this period and which we challenged were:\n\n- \u25a0 the impact on regulatory capital requirements in the event of an economic slowdown or recession.\n- \u25a0 the availability of funding and liquidity in the event of a market wide stress scenario; and\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the availability of financial resources in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a complete and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nAccordingly, we found the use of the going concern basis of preparation without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable.  However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n- \u25a0 We consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group's and Parent Company's financial statements is appropriate.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- \u25a0 We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.\n- \u25a0 The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 156 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n- \u25a0 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in Note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 to be acceptable.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability Our responsibility\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statements audit, we have nothing further to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n- \u25a0 the Directors' confirmation within the viability statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u25a0 the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n\nUnder the Listing Rules we are also required to review the Viability Statement.  Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n- \u25a0 the Directors' explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit.  As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability.\n\n- \u25a0 We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\n## Our reporting\n\n- \u25a0 We have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.",

The key areas where we identified greater levels of management judgement and therefore increased levels of audit focus in the Group's estimation of ECLs are:\n\n## Subjective estimate\n\nModel estimations - Inherently judgemental modelling and assumptions are used to estimate ECL which involves determining Probabilities of Default ('PD'), Probabilities of Survival ('PS'), Loss Given Default ('LGD'), and Exposures at Default ('EAD'). ECLs may be inappropriate if certain models or underlying assumptions do not accurately predict defaults or recoveries over time, become out of line with wider industry experience, or fail to reflect the credit risk of financial assets. As a result, certain IFRS 9 models and model assumptions are the key drivers of complexity and subjectivity in the Group's calculation of the ECL estimate.\n\nEconomic scenarios - IFRS 9 requires the Group to measure ECLs on an unbiased forward-looking basis reflecting a range of future economic conditions. Significant management judgement is applied in determining the forward-looking economic scenarios used, the probability weightings associated with the scenarios and the complexity of models used to derive the probability weightings.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nKey aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of the key controls over the:\n\nControls testing : We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the ECL processes. We tested the relevant manual, general IT and application controls over key systems used in the ECL process.\n\n- \u25a0 completeness and accuracy of the key inputs into the IFRS 9 impairment models;\n- \u25a0 model validation, implementation and monitoring;\n- \u25a0 application of the staging criteria;\n- \u25a0 authorisation and calculation of post model adjustments and management overlays; and\n\nOur credit risk modelling expertise: We involved our own credit risk modellers who assisted in the following:\n\n- \u25a0 selection and implementation of economic variables and the controls over the economic scenario selection and probabilities.\n- \u25a0 evaluating the Group's impairment methodologies for compliance with IFRS 9;\n- \u25a0 evaluating for a selection of models which were changed or updated during the year as to whether the changes (including the updated model code) were appropriate by assessing the updated model methodology against the applicable accounting standard;\n- \u25a0 inspecting model code for the calculation of certain components of the ECL model to assess its consistency with the Group's approved staging criteria and the output of the model;\n- \u25a0 reperforming the calculation of certain qualitative adjustments to assess consistency with the qualitative adjustment methodologies;\n- \u25a0 assessing and reperforming, for a selection of models, the reasonableness of the model predictions by comparing them against actual results and evaluating the resulting differences.\n- \u25a0 evaluating the model output for a selection of models by inspecting the corresponding model functionality and independently implementing the model by rebuilding the model code and comparing our independent output with management's output; and",

They represent approximately 23.6% net of the ECL. These adjustments are inherently uncertain and significant management judgement is involved in estimating certain post model adjustments ('PMA's') and management overlays.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the impairment of loans and advances to customers including off balance sheet elements has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The credit risk sections of the financial statements (page 238-244) disclose the sensitivities estimated by the Group.\n\nThe disclosures regarding the Group's application of IFRS 9 are key to explaining the key judgements and material inputs to the IFRS 9 ECL results.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 the effectiveness of the control environment operating over the calculation of the ECL provisions;\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee our approach to the audit of the ECL provisions and conclusions arising from our audit procedures.

These financial instruments are classified as Level 3, with management having controls in place over the boundary between Level 2 and 3 positions. Our significant audit risk is therefore primarily over significant Level 3 portfolios.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's financial instruments is determined through the application of valuation techniques which can involve the exercise of significant judgement by the Group in relation to the choice of the valuation models, pricing inputs and post-model pricing adjustments, including fair value adjustments (FVAs) and credit and funding adjustments (together referred to as XVAs).\n\nIn addition, there may also be valuation complexity associated with Level 2 portfolios, specifically where valuation modelling techniques result in significant limitations or where there is greater uncertainty around the choice of an appropriate pricing methodology, and consequently more than one valuation methodology could be used for that product across the market.\n\nWe identified two areas of such complexity. The first a derivatives portfolio that we considered to be harder to value Level 2 due to an element of modelling complexity associated with the product, and the second the XVA adjustments made to derivative valuations.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nControl testing: We attended management's valuation committee throughout the year and observed discussion and challenge over valuation themes including items related to the valuation of certain difficult-to-value financial instruments recorded at fair value.\n\nRisk assessment: We performed granular and detailed risk assessment procedures over the entirety of Level 1, 2 and Level 3 balances within the Group's financial statements (i.e. all of the fair value financial instruments held by the Group). As part of these risk assessment procedures, we identified which portfolios have a risk of material misstatement including those arising from significant judgements over valuation either due to unobservable inputs or complex models, see left for more explanation.\n\nWe performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the valuations processes. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating specifically to these portfolios.\n\nIndependent price verification (IPV), performed by a control function, of key market pricing inputs, including completeness of positions and valuation inputs subject to the IPV process;\n\nKey aspects of our controls testing involved evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of the key controls over:\n\nFVAs, including exit adjustments (to mark the portfolio to bid or offer prices), model shortcoming reserves to address model limitations and XVAs;\n\nThe assessment of the observability of a product and their unobservable inputs.\n\nThe validation, completeness, implementation and usage of valuation models. This included controls over assessment of model limitations and assumptions; and\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists in the following:\n\nChallenging the appropriateness of significant models and methodologies used in calculating fair values, risk exposures and in calculating FVAs, including comparison to industry practice.\n\nIndependently re-pricing a selection of fair value financial instruments , including additional selections for financial instruments referencing new RFRs and challenging management on the valuations where they were outside our tolerance; and\n\nSeeking contradictory evidence: For a selection of collateral disputes identified through management's control we challenged management's valuation where significant fair value differences were observable with the market participant on the other side of the trade. We also utilised collateral dispute data to identify fair value financial instruments with significant fair value differences against market counter parties and selected these to independently reprice.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Small changes to these assumptions have a significant impact on the measurement of the defined benefit pension obligation.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group reported a gross defined benefit pension obligation of \u00a330.9bn relating to UKRF.\n\nThe disclosures regarding the Group's application of IAS 19 (including assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty) are key to explaining the key judgements applied in the IAS 19 Defined Benefit Obligation calculation.\n\n## Disclosure quality\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 Our definition of the Key Audit Matter relating to the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation and specifically the rationale for the removal of pension assets, which was included in the prior year, from the definition of our Key Audit Matter.\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee:\n\n- \u25a0 We also discussed our audit response to the key audit matter which included the use of specialists to challenge key aspects of management's actuarial valuation.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 Controls over management's review of IAS19 assumptions including the discount rate, RPI and mortality assumptions.\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the defined benefit obligation process. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the process. These included:\n\n- \u25a0 Reconciliation controls of the IAS19 disclosures to underlying data.\n\nOur actuarial expertise: we involved our own actuarial professionals in the following:\n\nEvaluation of management's expert: We evaluated the objectivity and competence of management's actuarial expert involved in the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation.\n\n- \u25a0 Evaluating the judgements made and the appropriateness of methodologies used by management and management's actuarial expert in determining the key actuarial assumptions.\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed the adequacy of the Group's financial statements disclosures in the context of the relevant accounting standards\n\n- \u25a0 Comparing the assumptions used by Barclays to our independently compiled expected ranges based on market observable indices and our market experience.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed we consider the valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation in respect of UKRF to be acceptable (2020 result: acceptable).\n\nSubjective and complex auditor judgement was required in evaluating the key actuarial assumptions used by the Group (including the discount rate, retail price index and mortality assumptions).\n\nFurther information in the Annual Report and Accounts: See page 402 for the accounting policy on defined benefit schemes, and page 402 for the financial disclosure note 33 Pensions and post-retirement benefits.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Our audit approach relies on the effectiveness of IT access management controls. Our audit procedures identified deficiencies in certain IT access controls for systems relevant to financial reporting. More specifically, control deficiencies were identified around the primary monitoring of activities performed by privileged users on a small percentage of infrastructure components. Management has ongoing programmes to remediate the deficiencies. Since these deficiencies were open during the year, we performed additional procedures to respond to the risk of unauthorised changes to automated controls over financial reporting.\n\nOperations across several countries support a wide range of products and services resulting in a large and complex IT infrastructure relevant to the financial reporting processes and related internal controls.\n\n## Communications with the Barclays PLC Board Audit Committee\n\n- \u25a0 Our response to the Key Audit Matter which included the use of IT specialists to perform the testing.\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Board Audit Committee:\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\n- \u25a0 Authorising access rights for new joiners\n\nControl testing: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of automated controls that support material balances in the financial statements.

These assumptions, which are judgemental, are derived from a combination of management estimates, market data and other information obtained from external sources.\n\nThe improved market outlook for the retail banking business from the previous year is such that there was an indicator that the impairment loss may no longer exist. As a result of the VIU calculation, the full impairment loss of \u00a32.6bn was reversed.\n\nWe have also continued to consider the Group's current market capitalisation. While any impairment of the carrying value of subsidiaries does not affect the consolidated results of the Group, it does impact distributable reserves.\n\nDue to the materiality of the investment in subsidiaries in the context of the Parent Company financial statements, and considering the Group's current market capitalisation, this is the area that had the greatest impact on the overall Parent Company audit.\n\n## Our procedures to address the risk included:\n\nTest of details: We compared the carrying amount of each subsidiary to its draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount we assessed for potential indicators that investments in subsidiaries might be impaired or that impairment loss recognised in previous periods in respect of BBUK PLC should be reversed.\n\nControl testing: We performed end to end process walkthroughs to identify the key systems, applications and controls used in the process. We tested the design and operating effectiveness of the key controls relating to the process. These included controls over the identification of indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment and review of the key assumptions in determining the value in use.\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: For the two largest subsidiaries (BB PLC and BBUK PLC) we compared key assumptions including those underlying certain estimated future cash flows, the discount rate and the terminal growth rate to externally derived data including analyst broker reports, peer bank data and projected economic growth.\n\n- \u25a0 Evaluating the appropriateness of the discount rate used by independently developing discount rate ranges using external data sources and peer bank data; and\n\nOur valuations expertise: We involved our own valuations specialists in the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Assessing whether the methodology over management's calculation of the VIU is compliant with the requirements of the accounting standard.\n\nHistorical comparison: We performed a retrospective review by comparing the MTP from previous years to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately prepare cash flow forecasts at the individual subsidiary level.\n\nOur business understanding: We used our business understanding to evaluate the reasonableness of certain key assumptions and considerations made when developing the Group's MTP estimated future cash flows.\n\nAssessing transparency: We assessed whether the disclosures around the assessment of recoverable amount of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries adequately reflects key assumptions and sensitivities considering the level of risks inherent in the assessment of recoverable amount of the Parent Company's investment in subsidiaries.\n\ncla\n\ny",

Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\n## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. In this risk assessment we considered the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Enquiries of operational managers, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures relating to\n- \u25a0 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclays' internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations;\n- -detecting and responding to the risks of fraud as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n- \u25a0 The Group's remuneration policies and key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels;\n- -the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working;\n- \u25a0 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group and Company, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries.  The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted throughout the audit where further guidance was deemed necessary.\n\n## Fraud risk communication\n\n## Fraud risks and our procedures to address them\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and we remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level.\n\nWe identified five fraud risks which were communicated to component audit teams. The nature of these fraud risks is substantially unchanged from the prior year. The fraud risks we identified are set out below:\n\n- 2)  Valuations - risk relating to unobservable pricing inputs used to price level 3 fair value instruments\n- 1)   IFRS 9 ECL: Judgemental qualitative adjustments made to the ECL provision\n- 3)  Revenue recognition: Cut-off of the recognition of revenue from investment banking advisory fees\n- 5)   The risk of management override of controls, common with all audits under ISAs (UK).\n- 4)  Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed overthe-counter bilateral derivatives\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account our overall knowledge of the control environment, we performed procedures to address the above risks, the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nThese procedures also included identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation.\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls, assessing significant accounting estimates for bias, as well as substantive procedures to address the fraud risks.\n\n## Incorporating unpredictability into our audit: A\n\nAs an example, we performed audit procedures over Private Bank and Overseas Services ('PBOS') deposit and loans and advances balances in different locations, including Monaco and Switzerland in the current year.\n\nrequirement of the auditing standards is that we undertake procedures which are deliberately unexpected and could not have reasonably been predicted by Barclays' management.\n\n## Link to key audit matters\n\n## Laws and regulations - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nFurther details of the testing we perform over the identified fraud risks for ECL and fair value of financial instruments are included in the respective key audit matters sections 4.1 and 4.2 of this report, as the procedures relating to those estimates also address the risk of fraud.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\n- \u25a0 our general commercial and sector experience;\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. For this risk assessment, matters considered include the following:\n\n- \u25a0 inquiries with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards);\n- \u25a0 inspection of the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u25a0 inspection of the Group's key regulatory and legal correspondence;\n- \u25a0 relevant discussions with the Group's external legal counsel; and\n- \u25a0 relevant discussions with the Group's key regulatory supervisors including the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Conduct Authority, Federal Reserve Board, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Joint Supervisory Team.",

Our assessment included inspection of key frameworks, policies and standards in place, understanding and evaluating the role of the compliance function in establishing these and monitoring compliance and testing of related controls around whistleblowing and complaints.\n\nOur identified laws and regulations risks was communicated throughout our team and we remained alert to any indications of noncompliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at Group level.\n\n## Risk communication\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly impact the financial statements including:\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\n- \u25a0 financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation);\n- \u25a0 taxation legislation (direct and indirect).\n- \u25a0 distributable profits legislation; and\n\nWe assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/regulation areas\n\nWe identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's permission to operate in countries where the non-adherence to laws could prevent trading in such countries.\n\n- \u25a0 Specific aspects of regulatory capital and liquidity\n- \u25a0 Customer conduct rules\n- \u25a0 Other banking  laws and regulations\n- \u25a0 Money laundering\n- \u25a0 Market abuse regulations\n- \u25a0 Sanctions list and financial crime\n- \u25a0 Certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. If a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Audit response\n\nIn respect of regulatory matters relating to conduct risk our procedures included inspection of regulatory correspondence, independent enquiry of the Group's main regulators and performing audit procedures to respond to risks of material misstatement identified in recognised conduct provisions.\n\nIn relation to the legal, competition and regulatory matters disclosed in note 26 we performed audit procedures which included making enquiries of Barclays internal counsel and inspection of minutes of meetings and regulatory correspondence. For a subset of these matters which we deemed to be more significant we also made enquiries of external counsel and obtained legal confirmations from Barclays' external counsel.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing noncompliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards.  For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.",

Our determination of materiality\n\n## Materiality for the financial statements as a whole\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## What we mean\n\n2021: \u00a3230m\n\n2020: \u00a3230m\n\nThis is the amount representing the total magnitude of misstatements that we expect to influence the economic decisions of the users of these financial statements.\n\nConsistent with FY20, we determined that profit before tax from continuing operations, normalised using our professional judgement for items which significantly distort results in any one particular year, remains the key benchmark for the Barclays PLC Group to use in setting auditor's materiality. For FY21 we normalised this benchmark downward by \u00a32.3bn to adjust for the fact that ECL charges for the current year are considered abnormally low due to the impact of government support provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a more appropriate amount to use as a benchmark for setting our materiality level. For FY20 we normalised this benchmark upward by \u00a32.1bn by excluding the identified impact of COVID-19 on the ECL charge.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nIn determining the materiality benchmark, we had regard to investor commentary on the group, and the process followed by investors who also typically remove charges of this nature as they seek to derive a profit before tax amount to use as the basis for investment appraisal.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements was set at \u00a3225m (2020: \u00a3225m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company net assets (of which it represents 0.4% (2020: 0.4%)).\n\nOur materiality of \u00a3230m (2020: \u00a3230m) was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised Profit Before Tax. When using a profit-related measure to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach is to apply a percentage between 3% and 5% to the pre-tax measure. In setting overall materiality, we applied a rate of 3.8% (2020: 4.4%) which is lower than the top end of the allowable percentage range.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\n2021: \u00a3170m 2020: \u00a3170m\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to performance materiality so as to reduce, to an acceptable level, the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 74% (2020: 74%) of materiality for Barclays PLC Group's financial statements as a whole to be appropriate. We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nThe Group performance materiality was set at \u00a3170m (2020: \u00a3170m).\n\n|                                   | Total Revenue   | Total Revenue   | Total Assets   | Total Assets   | Net Assets   | Net Assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                   | 2021            | 2020            | 2021           | 2020           | 2021         | 2020         |\n|                                   | \u00a321,940m        | \u00a321,776m        | \u00a31,384,285m    | \u00a31,349,514m    | \u00a370,211m     | \u00a366,882m     |\n| Group Materiality as % of caption | 1.05%           | 1.06%           | 0.02%          | 0.02%          | 0.33%        | 0.34%        |\n\n## Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\n## What we mean\n\n2021: \u00a311m\n\n2020: \u00a311m\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of differences below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and scope of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller differences which are indicators of fraud.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgements applied\n\nThis is also the amount above which all differences identified are communicated to Barclays PLC's Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe audit misstatement posting threshold has been set at a level of 5% (2020:5%) of materiality for Barclays PLC's Group financial statements. We consider this appropriate based on the number and nature of audit differences (adjusted and unadjusted) identified during previous audits.\n\nThe overall materiality for the Group of \u00a3230m (2020: \u00a3230m), determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised PBT of which it represents 3.8% (2020: 4.4%), compares as follows to the other main financial statement elements amounts.",

The scope of our audit\n\n## What we mean\n\n## Group scope\n\nWe perform our planning and risk assessment procedures to identify balances where there is a risk of material misstatement and we include these in the scope of our audit.\n\nWe have subjected three (2020: three) of the Group's five components to full scope audits for Group purposes. Our approach to scoping the three components was as follows: for two components, Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Execution Services Limited Solus, we directly instructed the component audit teams to conduct and report to us on full scope audits; and for the other component, Barclays Bank PLC Group, we specified seven (2020: four) components within that group.\n\nWe were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting in all areas of our audit, and where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the extent of our substantive audit work.\n\nWe have subjected two (2020: nil) additional components to an audit of certain account balances carried out by us. These components represent less than 1% of total Group assets.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated in section 2 - Group scope.\n\nWithin the Barclays Bank PLC Group we specified the components as follows; Barclays Bank Solus to be subject to a full scope audit carried out by us; Barclays Bank Delaware and Barclays Capital Inc to be subject to a full scope audit as instructed by us; and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited to be subject to an audit of certain account balances as instructed by us. We have subjected two additional components to an audit of certain account balances carried out by us, these components represent less than 4% of total Barclays Bank PLC Group assets.\n\nBarclays PLC has centralised certain Group-wide processes in India, the outputs of which are included in the financial information of the reporting components it services and therefore is not a separate reporting component. These Group-wide procedures are subject to specified audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing, reconciliations and review controls. Additional procedures are performed at certain reporting components to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed over the shared service centres.\n\n- \u25a0 Testing of IT systems and configurations;\n\nThe Group audit team has also performed audit procedures centrally across the Group in the following areas:\n\n- \u25a0 Consolidation of the financial information; and\n\nIn addition, outside of the components subject to audit procedures set out above, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\n- \u25a0 Operating expenses and Group recharges.\n\n## Group audit team oversight What we mean\n\nA virtual communication and oversight strategy was implemented between the Group audit team and the components during the COVID-19 pandemic and this continues to be our primary method of oversight.\n\n| Scope            |   Number of components | Range of materiality applied   |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Full scope audit |                      3 | \u00a375m - \u00a3170m                   |\n\nAudit of account balance\n\n2\n\n\u00a375m - \u00a375m\n\nThe Group audit team is required to instruct the component teams about their responsibilities in relation to the consolidated Group audit and to understand the approach taken by the components to meet these responsibilities. The Group audit team is also required to understand the conclusions reached by the component teams and to review and challenge the work they have performed to reach these conclusions.\n\nThis included:\n\n- \u25a0 Instructions issued by the Group audit team to component auditors setting out the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant key audit matters identified above and the information to be reported back to the Group audit team;\n- \u25a0 A virtual global planning conference led by the Group audit team to discuss key audit risks and obtain input from component teams and other participating locations;\n- \u25a0 Review and approval by the Group audit team of the component materiality for all components;\n- \u25a0 Fortnightly video conferences with the partners and directors of the Group and component audit teams along with regular ad-hoc contact via video calls and email exchanges to challenge the component audit approach and findings;\n- \u25a0 Risk assessment and challenge sessions with each component audit team in the planning and final phases of the audit led by the Group engagement partner and audit quality partner;\n- \u25a0 Michelle Hinchliffe, the Group Lead Engagement Partner (and Senior Statutory Auditor), attended each Board Audit Committee for Barclays Bank PLC and at least one Board Audit Committee for each of Barclays Bank UK, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware, and Barclays Bank Ireland;\n- \u25a0 Review of key working papers within component audit files (using remote technology capabilities) to understand and challenge the audit approach and audit findings of each component.",

Respective responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 149, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities.\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by the Company.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and the further matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the terms agreed with the Company, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Michelle Hinchliffe\n\nChartered Accountants 15 Canada Square London E14 5GL\n\n(Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor\n\n22 February 2022\n\ncla\n\ny",

Comparatives have been restated.  The effect of this change was to increase the net cash outflow due to investing activities increased by \u00a34,732m in 2020 and \u00a34,464m in 2019, with the net cash inflow relating to financing activities increasing by the same amount  .\n- a Includes financial assets at fair value through the income statement.\n- c Includes financial liabilities designated at fair value.\n\nThe Parent company's principal activity is to hold the investment in its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Execution Services Limited and Barclays Principal Investments Limited. Dividends received are treated as operating income.",

If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a particular note, the accounting policy and/or critical accounting estimate is contained with the relevant note.\n\n## 1 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 1. Reporting entity\n\nThese financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services. In addition, separate financial statements have been presented for the holding company.\n\nBarclays PLC is a public company limited by shares registered in England under company number 48839, having its registered office at 1 Churchill Place, London, E14 5HP.\n\n## 2. Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UKadopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the separate financial statements of Barclays PLC, have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), including interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, as there are no applicable differences from IFRS as issued by the IASB for the periods presented.\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and separate financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements. These policies have been consistently applied, with the exception of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) which were applied from 1 January 2020.\n\nThe consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property, and particular financial instruments, to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies. These financial statements are stated in millions of pounds Sterling (\u00a3m), the functional currency of Barclays PLC.\n\n## 3. Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries (the Group) under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies using IFRS. The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board is satisfied that the Group and the parent company have the resources to continue in business for a period of at least 12 months from approval of the financial statements.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board has considered a wide range of information relating to present and future conditions and includes a review of a working capital report (WCR). The WCR is used by the Board to assess the future performance of the Group and that it has the resources in place that are required to meet its ongoing regulatory requirements. The assessment is based upon business plans which contain future projections of profitability taken from the Group's  medium-term plan as well as projections of regulatory capital requirements and business funding needs. The WCR also includes an assessment of the impact of internally generated stress testing scenarios on the liquidity and capital requirement forecasts. The stress tests used were based upon an assessment of reasonably possible downside economic scenarios that the Group could experience.  Further details are set out in the Viability statement on page 47.\n\nThe WCR showed that the Group had sufficient capital and liquidity in place to support its future business requirements and remained above its regulatory minimum requirements in the stress scenarios. Accordingly, the Directors concluded that there was a reasonable expectation that the Group and parent company has adequate resources to continue as a Going Concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The Group's significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing those items, are set out under the relevant notes. Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.\n\n## 4. Accounting policies\n\n## (i) Consolidation\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which Barclays PLC has control. The Group has control over another entity when the Group has all of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- \u25a0 power over the relevant activities of the investee, for example through voting or other rights\n- \u25a0 the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe assessment of control is based on the consideration of all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nChanges in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements include partnerships where the Group member is a partner, advantage has been taken of the exemption under Regulation 7 of the Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 with regard to preparing and filing of individual partnership financial statements.\n\nDetails of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 34.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency monetary balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.  Non-monetary foreign currency balances in relation to items measured in terms of historical cost are carried at historical transaction date exchange rates. Non-monetary foreign currency balances in relation to items measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was measured.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's foreign operations (including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches) based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies. The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.\n\nPrior to consolidation (or equity accounting) the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the period end exchange rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group disposes of the entire interest in a foreign operation, when partial disposal results in the loss of control of an interest in a subsidiary, when an investment previously accounted for using the equity method is accounted for as a financial asset, or on the disposal of a foreign operation within a branch.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments to the recognition, classification and measurement, and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities and the impairment of financial assets. The Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes.\n\n## (iii) Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Recognition\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract. Trade date or settlement date accounting is applied depending on the classification of the financial asset.\n\nFinancial assets are classified on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n- \u25a0 the business model within which financial assets are managed, and\n\nThe Group assesses the business model criteria at a portfolio level. Information that is considered in determining the applicable business model includes (i) policies and objectives for the relevant portfolio, (ii) how the performance and risks of the portfolio are managed, evaluated and reported to management, and (iii) the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, sales expectation for future periods, and the reasons for such sales.\n\nThe contractual cash flow characteristics of financial assets are assessed with reference to whether the cash flows represent SPPI. In assessing whether contractual cash flows are SPPI compliant, interest is defined as consideration primarily for the time value of money and the credit risk of the principal outstanding. The time value of money is defined as the element of interest that provides consideration only for the passage of time and not consideration for other risks or costs associated with holding the financial asset. Terms that could change the contractual cash flows so that it would not meet the condition for SPPI are considered, including: (i) contingent and leverage features, (ii) non-recourse arrangements and (iii) features that could modify the time value of money.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and their contractual cash flows represent SPPI.\n\nOther financial assets are measured at fair value through profit and loss. There is an option to make an irrevocable election on initial recognition for non traded equity investments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, in which case dividends are recognised in profit or loss, but gains or losses are not reclassified to profit or loss upon derecognition, and the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 do not apply.\n\nThe accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item. The Group's policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 17.\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where (i) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or (ii) the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have been transferred (usually by sale) and  with them either (a) substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or (b) where neither substantially all the risks and reward have been transferred or retained, where control over the asset has been lost.\n\n## Derecognition",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2021 continued\n\n## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nFinancial liabilities are de-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms - generally a difference of 10% or more in the present value of the cash flows or a substantive qualitative amendment - is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.\n\nTransactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred. It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. Such an analysis compares the Group's exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.\n\nA cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement. In particular, it is necessary to estimate the asset's expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation. The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible. The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios. Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario. Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity, or prepayment rates.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements (and stock borrowing or similar transactions) are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future. Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.\n\n## Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing\n\nThe Group purchases (a reverse repurchase agreement) or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them. The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration paid (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost, unless it is designated or mandatorily at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThe Group may also sell (a repurchase agreement) or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them. The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. Consideration received (or cash collateral provided) is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost, unless it is designated at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability (debt) or equity.\n\n## (iv) Issued debt and equity instruments\n\nIssued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having an obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument. If this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs. Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the Annual General Meeting and treated as a deduction from equity.\n\nWhere issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately. The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.\n\nA change in the basis of determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that is required by interest rate benchmark reform is accounted for by updating the effective interest rate, without the recognition of an immediate gain or loss. This practical expedient is only applied where (1) the change to the contractual cash flows is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform and (2) the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis. For changes made in addition to those required by the interest rate benchmark reform, the practical expedient is applied first, after which the normal IFRS 9 requirements for modifications of financial instruments is applied.\n\n## (v)  Changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows resulting from interest rate benchmark reform\n\nRefer to Note 14 for further details regarding hedge accounting policies in respect of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nRefer to Note 41 for further disclosure related to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and balances at central banks. Cash equivalents comprise loans and advances to banks, cash collateral balances with central banks related to payment schemes and treasury and other eligible bills, all with original maturities of three months or less. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are not considered to be part of cash equivalents.\n\n## (vi) Cash flow statement\n\nInvestments in debt securities at amortised cost, presented within loans and advances on the balance sheet, are deemed to be investing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, except those instruments considered to be cash equivalents.\n\nDebt securities issued and redeemed are considered to be operating activities, except qualifying eligible liabilities that satisfy regulatory requirements for MREL instruments (or have previously satisfied these requirements since 2019 when they came into effect), which are considered to be financing activities.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted  have been consistently applied, with the exception of the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments (amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) which were applied from 1 January 2020.\n\n## 5.

        "page_content": "## 1 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. Once effective, IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that was issued in 2005.\n\nIFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e. life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply.\n\nIn June 2020, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 17. The amendments that are relevant to the Group are the scope exclusion for credit card contracts and similar contracts that provide insurance coverage, the optional scope exclusion for loan contracts that transfer significant insurance risk, and the clarification that only financial guarantees issued are in scope of IFRS 9.\n\nThe amendments also defer the effective date of IFRS 17, including the above amendments, to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIFRS 17, including the 2020 amendments to IFRS 17, has been endorsed by the EU. Following the UK's withdrawal from the EU on 31 December 2020, the UK-adopted international accounting standards will be applicable. IFRS 17, including the amendments to IFRS 17, has not yet been endorsed by the UK. The Group does not expect the impact of IFRS 17 to be material.\n\nIn February 2021 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 that require entities to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on the concept of materiality and its application to accounting policy information.\n\n## Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2\n\nUnder the amendments, accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, and will be applied from that date.\n\nIn February 2021 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 that replace the definition of a change in accounting estimates with a definition of accounting estimates.\n\n## Definition of Accounting Estimate - Amendments to IAS 8\n\nUnder the new definition, accounting estimates are clarified as monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. Where an entity's accounting policy requires an item to be measured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed directly, it should develop an accounting estimate to achieve this objective.\n\nThe amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, and will be applied from that date.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies. The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note. Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in:\n\n## 6. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\n- \u25a0 Credit impairment charges on page 348\n- \u25a0 Fair value of financial instruments on page 367\n- \u25a0 Tax on page 352\n- \u25a0 Goodwill and intangible assets on page 382\n- \u25a0 Provisions including conduct and legal, competition and regulatory matters on page 386.\n- \u25a0 Pensions and post-retirement benefits - obligations on page 402\n\n## 7. Other disclosures\n\n- \u25a0 Credit risk on pages 218 to 219 and 225 to 260\n\nTo improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk review section as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Market risk on page 219 to 220 and 261 to 262\n- \u25a0 Treasury and capital risk - capital on pages 220 to 221 and 275 to 281.\n- \u25a0 Treasury and capital risk - liquidity on pages 220 and 265 to 274\n\nThese disclosures are covered by the Audit opinion (included on pages 314 to 330) where referenced as audited.",

To the extent these costs are attributed to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) and incremental to the origination of credit card balances, they are capitalised and subsequently included within the calculation of the effective interest rate. They are amortised to interest income over the period of expected repayment of the originated balance. Costs attributed to customers that settle their outstanding balances each period (transactors) are deferred on the balance sheet as a cost of obtaining a contract and amortised to fee and commission expense over the life of the customer relationship (refer to Note 4). There are no other individual estimates involved in the calculation of effective interest rates that are material to the results or financial position.\n\n|                                               | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash and balances at central banks            | 184       | 275       | 1,091     |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost          | 9,540     | 10,180    | 12,450    |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income | 550       | 776       | 1,032     |\n| Negative interest on liabilities              | 248       | 68        | 13        |\n| Other                                         | 718       | 593       | 870       |\n| Interest and similar income                   | 11,240    | 11,892    | 15,456    |\n| Deposits at amortised cost                    | (561)     | (1,030)   | (2,449)   |\n| Debt securities in issue a                    | (1,340)   | (1,360)   | (1,906)   |\n| Subordinated liabilities                      | (507)     | (670)     | (1,068)   |\n| Negative interest on assets                   | (374)     | (344)     | (278)     |\n| Other                                         | (385)     | (366)     | (348)     |\n| Interest and similar expense                  | (3,167)   | (3,770)   | (6,049)   |\n| Net interest income                           | 8,073     | 8,122     | 9,407     |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Barclays has amended the presentation of the premium paid for purchased financial guarantees which are embedded in notes it issues directly to the market.

IFRS 15 establishes a five-step model governing revenue recognition. The five-step model requires the Group to (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify each of the performance obligations included in the contract, (iii) determine the amount of consideration in the contract, (iv) allocate the consideration to each of the identified performance obligations and (v) recognise revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nThe Group recognises fee and commission income charged for services provided by the Group as the services are provided, for example, on completion of the underlying transaction. Where the contractual arrangements also result in the Group recognising financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9, such financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9 before applying the provisions of IFRS 15.\n\nFee and commission income is disaggregated below by fee types that reflect the nature of the services offered across the Group and operating segments, in accordance with IFRS 15. The below table includes a total for fees in scope of IFRS 15.

These include interchange and merchant fee income generated from credit and bank card usage. Transaction and processing fees are recognised at the point in time the transaction occurs or service is performed. Interchange and merchant fees are recognised upon settlement of the card transaction payment.\n\n## Transactional\n\nThe Group incurs certain card related costs including those related to cardholder reward programmes and payments to co-brand partners. Cardholder reward programmes costs related to customers that settle their outstanding balance each period (transactors) are expensed when incurred and presented in fee and commission expense while costs related to customers that continuously carry an outstanding balance (revolvers) are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Payments to partners for new cardholder account originations related to transactor accounts are deferred as costs to obtain a contract under IFRS 15, while costs related to revolver accounts are included in the effective interest rate of the receivable (refer to Note 3). Those costs deferred under IFRS 15 are capitalised and amortised over the estimated life of the customer relationship. Payments to co-brand partners based on revenue sharing are presented as a reduction of fee and commission income while payments based on profitability are presented in fee and commission expense.\n\nAdvisory fees are generated from wealth management services and investment banking advisory services related to mergers, acquisitions and financial restructurings. Wealth management advisory fees are earned over the period the services are provided and are generally recognised quarterly when the market value of client assets is determined. Investment banking advisory fees are recognised at the point in time when the services related to the transaction have been completed under the terms of the engagement. Investment banking advisory costs are recognised as incurred in fee and commission expense if direct and incremental to the advisory services or are otherwise recognised in operating expenses.\n\n## Advisory\n\n## Brokerage and execution\n\n## Underwriting and syndication\n\nBrokerage and execution fees are earned for executing client transactions with various exchanges and over-the-counter markets and assisting clients in clearing transactions. Brokerage and execution fees are recognised at the point in time the associated service has been completed which is generally the trade date of the transaction.\n\nUnderwriting and syndication fees are earned for the distribution of client equity or debt securities and the arrangement and administration of a loan syndication. This includes commitment fees to provide loan financing. Underwriting fees are generally recognised on trade date if there is no remaining contingency, such as the transaction being conditional on the closing of an acquisition or another transaction. Underwriting costs are deferred and recognised in fee and commission expense when the associated underwriting fees are recorded. Syndication fees are earned for arranging and administering a loan syndication; however, the associated fee may be subject to variability until the loan has been syndicated to other syndicate members or until other contingencies have been resolved and therefore the fee revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved.\n\nIncluded in the underwriting and syndication fees are loan commitment fees which are not presented as part of the carrying value of the loan in accordance with IFRS 9. Such commitment fees are recognised over time through to the contractual maturity of the commitment.\n\nThe Group had no material contract assets or contract liabilities as at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a3nil; 2019: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Contract assets and contract liabilities\n\n## Impairment of fee receivables and contract assets\n\n## Remaining performance obligations\n\nDuring 2021, there have been no material impairments recognised in relation to fees receivable and contract assets (2020: \u00a3nil; 2019: \u00a3nil). Fees in relation to transactional business can be added to outstanding customer balances. These amounts may be subsequently impaired as part of the overall loans and advances balance.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less or because the Group has a right to consideration that corresponds directly with the value of the service provided to the client or customer.\n\nThe Group expects that incremental costs of obtaining a contract such as success fees and commission fees paid are recoverable and therefore capitalised such contract  costs.  Capitalised contract costs net of amortisation as at 31 December 2021 is \u00a3154m  (2020: \u00a3141m; 2019: \u00a3159m).\n\n## Costs incurred in obtaining or fulfilling a contract\n\nCapitalised contract costs are amortised based on the transfer of services to which the asset relates which typically ranges over the expected life of the relationship. In 2021, the amount of amortisation was \u00a336m (2020: \u00a336m; 2019: \u00a330m) and there was no impairment loss recognised in connection with the capitalised contract costs (2020: \u00a3nil; 2019: \u00a3nil).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021 continued\n\n## 7 Credit impairment charge/(release)\n\n## Accounting for the impairment of financial assets Impairment\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, the Group is required to recognise expected credit losses (ECLs) based on unbiased forward-looking information for all financial assets at amortised cost, lease receivables, debt financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\nAt the reporting date, an allowance (or provision for loan commitments and financial guarantees) is required for the 12 month (Stage 1) ECLs. If the credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition (Stage 2), or if the financial instrument is credit impaired (Stage 3), an allowance (or provision) should be recognised for the lifetime ECLs.\n\nThe measurement of ECL is calculated using three main components: (i) probability of default (PD) (ii) loss given default (LGD) and (iii) the exposure at default (EAD).\n\nThe 12 month and lifetime ECLs are calculated by multiplying the respective PD, LGD and the EAD. The 12 month and lifetime PDs represent the PD occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively. The EAD represents the expected balance at default, taking into account the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event together with any expected drawdowns of committed facilities. The LGD represents expected losses on the EAD given the event of default, taking into account, among other attributes, the mitigating effect of collateral value at the time it is expected to be realised and the time value of money.\n\nDetermining a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition:\n\nThe Group assesses when a significant increase in credit risk has occurred based on quantitative and qualitative assessments. The credit risk of an exposure is considered to have significantly increased when:\n\nThe annualised lifetime PD has increased by more than an agreed threshold relative to the equivalent at origination.\n\n## i) Quantitative test\n\nPD deterioration thresholds are defined as percentage increases, and are set at an origination score band and segment level to ensure the test appropriately captures significant increases in credit risk at all risk levels. Generally, thresholds are inversely correlated to the origination PD, i.e. as the origination PD increases, the threshold value reduces.\n\nThe assessment of the point at which a PD increase is deemed 'significant', is based upon analysis of the portfolio's risk profile against a common set of principles and performance metrics (consistent across both retail and wholesale businesses), incorporating expert credit judgement where appropriate. Application of quantitative PD floors does not represent the use of the low credit risk exemption as exposures can separately move into Stage 2 via the qualitative route described below.\n\nWholesale assets apply a 100% increase in PD and 0.2% PD floor to determine a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nRetail assets apply bespoke relative increase and absolute PD thresholds based on product type and origination PD. Thresholds are subject to maximums defined by Group policy and typically apply minimum relative thresholds of 50-100% and a maximum relative threshold of 400%.\n\nFor existing/historical exposures where origination point scores or data are no longer available or do not represent a comparable estimate of lifetime PD, a proxy origination score is defined, based upon:\n\n- \u25a0 use of available historical account performance data and other customer information, to derive a comparable 'proxy' estimation of origination PD.\n- \u25a0 back-population of the approved lifetime PD score either to origination date or, where this is not feasible, as far back as possible (subject to a data start point no later than 1 January 2015); or\n\n## ii) Qualitative test\n\nThis is relevant for accounts that meet the portfolio's 'high risk' criteria and are subject to closer credit monitoring.\n\nHigh risk customers may not be in arrears but either through an event or an observed behaviour exhibit credit distress. The definition and assessment of high risk includes as wide a range of information as reasonably available, such as industry and Group-wide customer level data, including but not limited to bureau scores and high consumer indebtedness index, wherever possible or relevant.\n\nWhilst the high risk populations applied for IFRS 9 impairment purposes are aligned with risk management processes, they are also regularly reviewed and validated to ensure that they capture any incremental segments where there is evidence of credit deterioration.\n\nThis is relevant for accounts that are more than 30 calendar days past due. The 30 days past due criteria is a backstop rather than a primary driver of moving exposures into Stage 2.\n\n## iii) Backstop criteria\n\nThe criteria for determining a significant increase in credit risk for assets with bullet repayments follows the same principle as all other assets, i.e. quantitative, qualitative and backstop tests are all applied.\n\nExposures will move back to Stage 1 once they no longer meet the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk. This means that, at a minimum all payments must be up-to-date, the PD deterioration test is no longer met, the account is no longer classified as high risk, and the customer has evidenced an ability to maintain future payments.",

Exposures being removed from Stage 3 must no longer qualify as credit impaired, and:\n\n- \u25a0 (for non-forborne exposures) the performance conditions are defined and approved within an appropriately sanctioned restructure plan, including 12 months' payment history have been met.\n- \u25a0 the obligor will also have demonstrated consistently good payment behaviour over a 12-month period, by making all consecutive contractual payments due and, for forborne exposures, the relevant EBA defined probationary period has also been successfully completed or;\n\nManagement overlays and other exceptions to model outputs are applied only if consistent with the objective of identifying significant increases in credit risk.\n\nThe measurement of ECL involves complexity and judgement, including estimation of PD, LGD, a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimation of expected lives (where contractual life is not appropriate), and estimation of EAD and assessing significant increases in credit risk.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nCredit losses are the expected cash shortfalls from what is contractually due over the expected life of the financial instrument, discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). ECLs are the unbiased probability-weighted credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and considering future economic conditions.\n\nThe Group uses a five-scenario model to calculate ECL. An external consensus forecast is assembled from key sources, including HM Treasury (short and medium term forecasts), Bloomberg (based on median of economic forecasts) and the Urban Land Institute (for US House Prices), which forms the baseline scenario. In addition, two adverse scenarios (Downside 1 and Downside 2) and two favourable scenarios (Upside 1 and Upside 2) are derived, with associated probability weightings. The adverse scenarios are calibrated to a similar severity to internal stress tests, whilst also considering IFRS 9 specific sensitivities and non-linearity. Downside 2 is benchmarked to the Bank of England's annual cyclical scenarios and to the most severe scenario from Moody's inventory, but is not designed to be the same. The favourable scenarios are calibrated to be symmetric to the adverse scenarios, subject to a ceiling calibrated to relevant recent favourable benchmark scenarios. The scenarios include eight economic variables (GDP, unemployment, House Price Index (HPI) and base rates in both the UK and US markets) and expanded variables using statistical models based on historical correlations. The upside and downside shocks are designed to evolve over a five-year stress horizon, with all five scenarios converging to a steady state after approximately eight years.\n\nThe methodology for estimating probability weights for each of the scenarios involves a comparison of the distribution of key historical UK and US macroeconomic variables against the forecast paths of the five scenarios. The methodology works such that the baseline (reflecting current consensus outlook) has the highest weight and the weights of adverse and favourable scenarios depend on the deviation from the baseline; the further from the baseline, the smaller the weight. A single set of five scenarios is used across all portfolios and all five weights are normalised to equate to 100%. The same scenarios and weights that are used in the estimation of expected credit losses are also used for the Group internal planning purposes. The impacts across the portfolios are different because of the sensitivities of each of the portfolios to specific macroeconomic variables, for example, mortgages are highly sensitive to house prices, and credit cards and unsecured consumer loans are highly sensitive to unemployment.\n\nThe definition of default for the purpose of determining ECLs, and for internal credit risk management purposes, has been aligned to the Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default, to maintain a consistent approach with IFRS 9 and associated regulatory guidance. The Regulatory Capital CRR Article 178 definition of default considers indicators that the debtor is unlikely to pay, includes exposures in forbearance and is no later than when the exposure is more than 90 days past due or 180 days past due in the case of UK mortgages. When exposures are identified as credit impaired at the time when they are purchased or originated interest income is calculated on the carrying value net of the impairment allowance.\n\n## Definition of default, credit impaired assets, write-offs, and interest income recognition\n\nAn asset is considered credit impaired when one or more events occur that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset. This comprises assets defined as defaulted and other individually assessed exposures where imminent default or actual loss is identified.\n\nUncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoverable amounts have been collected. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The timing and extent of write-offs may involve some element of subjective judgement. Nevertheless, a write-off will often be prompted by a specific event, such as the inception of insolvency proceedings or other formal recovery action, which makes it possible to establish that some or the entire advance is beyond realistic prospect of recovery.\n\nThe Group may enter into a financial guarantee contract which requires the issuer of such contract to reimburse the Group for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. For these separate financial guarantee contracts, the Group recognises a reimbursement asset aligned with the recognition of the underlying ECLs, if it is considered virtually certain that a reimbursement would be received if the specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of the debt instrument.\n\n## Accounting for purchased financial guarantee contracts",

This assessment considers both the change in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as the change in overall instrument risk profile. In respect of payment holidays granted to borrowers which are not due to forbearance, if the revised cash flows on a present value basis (based on the original EIR) are not substantially different from the original cash flows, the loan is not considered to be substantially modified.\n\nWhere terms are substantially different, the existing loan will be derecognised and a new loan will be recognised at fair value, with any difference in valuation recognised immediately within the income statement, subject to observability criteria.\n\nWhere terms are not substantially different, the loan carrying value will be adjusted to reflect the present value of modified cash flows discounted at the original EIR, with any resulting gain or loss recognised immediately within the income statement as a modification gain or loss.\n\nNote 1 sets out details for changes in the basis of determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument that are required by interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nLifetime ECLs must be measured over the expected life. This is restricted to the maximum contractual life and takes into account expected prepayment, extension, call and similar options. The exceptions are certain revolving financial instruments, such as credit cards and bank overdrafts, that include both a drawn and an undrawn component where the entity's contractual ability to demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not limit the entity's exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For revolving facilities, expected life is analytically derived to reflect the behavioural life of the asset, i.e. the full period over which the business expects to be exposed to credit risk. Behavioural life is typically based upon historical analysis of the average time to default, closure or withdrawal of facility. Where data is insufficient or analysis inconclusive, an additional 'maturity factor' may be incorporated to reflect the full estimated life of the exposures, based upon experienced judgement and/or peer analysis. Potential future modifications of contracts are not taken into account when determining the expected life or EAD until they occur.\n\n## Expected life\n\n## Discounting\n\n## Modelling techniques\n\nECLs are discounted at the EIR at initial recognition or an approximation thereof and consistent with income recognition. For loan commitments the EIR is the rate that is expected to apply when the loan is drawn down and a financial asset is recognised. Issued financial guarantee contracts are discounted at the risk free rate. Lease receivables are discounted at the rate implicit in the lease. For variable/floating rate financial assets, the spot rate at the reporting date is used and projections of changes in the variable rate over the expected life are not made to estimate future interest cash flows or for discounting.\n\nThe regulatory Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) ECL calculations are leveraged for IFRS 9 modelling but adjusted for key differences which include:\n\n- \u25a0 IFRS  9 models do not include certain conservative BCBS model floors and downturn assessments and require discounting to the reporting date at the original EIR rather than using the cost of capital to the date of default;\n- \u25a0 BCBS requires 12 month through the economic cycle losses whereas IFRS 9 requires 12 months or lifetime point in time losses based on conditions at the reporting date and multiple forecasts of the future economic conditions over the expected lives;\n- \u25a0 Management adjustments are made to modelled output to account for situations where known or expected risk factors and information have not been considered in the modelling process, for example forecast economic scenarios for uncertain political events; and\n- \u25a0 ECL is measured at the individual financial instrument level, however a collective approach where financial instruments with similar risk characteristics are grouped together, with apportionment to individual financial instruments, is used where effects can only be seen at a collective level, for example for forward-looking information.\n\nFor the IFRS 9 impairment assessment, the Group's risk models are used to determine the PD, LGD and EAD. For Stage 2 and 3, the Group applies lifetime PDs but uses 12 month PDs for Stage 1. The ECL drivers of PD, EAD and LGD are modelled at an account level which considers vintage, among other credit factors. Also, the assessment of significant increase in credit risk is based on the initial lifetime PD curve, which accounts for the different credit risk underwritten over time.\n\nA financial asset is subject to forbearance when it is modified due to the credit distress of the borrower. A modification made to the terms of an asset due to forbearance will typically be assessed as a non-substantial modification that does not result in derecognition of the original loan, except in circumstances where debt is exchanged for equity.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nBoth performing and non-performing forbearance assets are classified as Stage 3 except where it is established that the concession granted has not resulted in diminished financial obligation and that no other regulatory definition of default criteria have been triggered, in which case the asset is classified as Stage 2. The minimum probationary period for non-performing forbearance is 12 months and for performing forbearance, 24 months. Hence, a minimum of 36 months is required for non-performing forbearance to move out of a forborne state.\n\nNo financial instrument in forbearance can transfer back to Stage 1 until all of the Stage 2 thresholds are no longer met and can only move out of Stage 3 when no longer credit impaired.",

        "page_content": "## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIFRS 9 impairment involves several important areas of judgement, including estimating forward looking modelled parameters (PD, LGD and EAD), developing a range of unbiased future economic scenarios, estimating expected lives and assessing significant increases in credit risk, based on the Group's experience of managing credit risk. The determination of expected life is most material for Barclays credit card portfolios which is obtained via behavioural life analysis to materially capture the risk of these facilities.\n\nWithin the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, the impairment allowance is calculated using forward looking modelled parameters which are typically run at account level. There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category. Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised. Management adjustments to impairment models, which contain an element of subjectivity, are applied in order to factor in certain conditions or changes in policy that are not fully incorporated into the impairment models, or to reflect additional facts and circumstances at the period end. Management adjustments are reviewed and incorporated into future model development where appropriate. The impairment release reflected in the income statement for retail portfolios is \u00a3289m (2020: \u00a33,116m charge; 2019: \u00a31,696m charge) of the total impairment release on loans and advances and off balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\nFor individually significant assets in Stage 3, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows across a range of economic scenarios are taken into account. These considerations can be particularly subjective and can include the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Group's position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process. The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows (discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate), and its carrying amount. Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken. Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge. The impairment release reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is  \u00a3346m (2020: \u00a31,569m charge; 2019: \u00a3208m release) of the total impairment release on loans and advances and off balance sheet loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\nFurther information on impairment allowances, impairment charges, management adjustments to models for impairment, measurement uncertainty, sensitivity analysis and related credit information is set out within the Credit risk performance section.\n\nTemporary adjustments to calculated IFRS9 impairment allowances may be applied in limited circumstances to account for situations where known or expected risk factors or information have not been considered in the ECL assessment or modelling process.

Income tax payable on taxable profits (current tax) is recognised as an expense in the periods in which the profits arise. Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes. Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior periods. Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is not recognised where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nThe Group considers an uncertain tax position to exist when it considers that ultimately, in the future, the amount of profit subject to tax may be greater than the amount initially reflected in the Group's tax returns. The Group accounts for provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions in two different ways.\n\nA current tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will alter the amount of cash tax due to, or from, a tax authority in the future. From recognition, the current tax provision is then measured at the amount the Group ultimately expects to pay the tax authority to resolve the position. The accrual of interest and penalty amounts in respect of uncertain income tax positions is recognised as an expense within profit before tax.\n\nDeferred tax provisions are adjustments made to the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of uncertain tax positions. A deferred tax provision is recognised when it is considered probable that the outcome of a review by a tax authority of an uncertain tax position will result in a reduction in the carrying value of the deferred tax asset. From recognition of a provision, measurement of the underlying deferred tax asset is adjusted to take into account the expected impact of resolving the uncertain tax position on the loss or temporary difference giving rise to the deferred tax asset.\n\nThe approach taken to measurement takes account of whether the uncertain tax position is a discrete position that will be reviewed by the tax authority in isolation from any other position, or one of a number of issues which are expected to be reviewed together concurrently and resolved simultaneously with a tax authority. The Group's measurement of provisions is based upon its best estimate of the additional profit that will become subject to tax. For a discrete position, consideration is given only to the merits of that position. Where a number of issues are expected to be reviewed and resolved together, the Group will take into account not only the merits of its position in respect of each particular issue but also the overall level of provision relative to the aggregate of the uncertain tax positions across all the issues that are expected to be resolved at the same time. In addition, in assessing provision levels, it is assumed that tax authorities will review uncertain tax positions and that all facts will be fully and transparently disclosed.",

Firstly, the level of provisioning for uncertain tax positions; and secondly, the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group does not consider there to be a significant risk of a material adjustment to the carrying amount of current and deferred tax balances, including provisions for uncertain tax positions in the next financial year.  The provisions for uncertain tax positions cover a diverse range of issues and reflect advice from external counsel where relevant.  It should be noted that only a proportion of the total uncertain tax positions will be under audit at any point in time, and could therefore be subject to challenge by a tax authority over the next year.\n\nDeferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts. Details on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided in this note.\n\n|                                       | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current tax charge/(credit)           |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | 1,467     | 1,255     | 1,037     |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | 317       | 31        | (45)      |\n|                                       | 1,784     | 1,286     | 992       |\n| Deferred tax (credit)/charge          |           |           |           |\n| Current year                          | (352)     | (830)     | 86        |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years | (244)     | 148       | (75)      |\n|                                       | (596)     | (682)     | 11        |\n| Tax charge                            | 1,188     | 604       | 1,003     |\n\nThe table below shows the reconciliation between the actual tax charge and the tax charge that would result from applying the standard UK corporation tax rate to the Group's profit before tax.\n\n|                                                                                         | 2021   | 2021          | 2020   | 2020        | 2019   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                                         | \u00a3m     | %             | \u00a3m     | %           | \u00a3m     | %      |\n| Profit before tax                                                                       | 8,414  |               | 3,065  |             | 4,357  |        |\n| Tax charge based on the standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% (2020:                  |        |               |        |             |        |        |\n| 19%; 2019: 19% )                                                                        | 1,599  | 19.0%         | 582    | 19.0%       | 828    | 19.0%  |\n| Impact of profits/losses earned in territories with different statutory rates to        |        |               |        |             |        |        |\n| the UK (weighted average tax rate is 22.4% (2020: 25.1%; 2019: 24.2% ))                 | 285    | 3.4%          | 188    | 6.1%        | 227    | 5.2%   |\n| Recurring items:                                                                        |        |               |        |             |        |        |\n| Non-creditable taxes including withholding taxes                                        | 134    | 1.6%          | 109    | 3.5%        | 150    | 3.4%   |\n| Banking surcharge and other items                                                       | 83     | 1.0%          | 6      | 0.2%        | 57     | 1.3%   |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                                                 | 80     | 1.0%          | 48     | 1.6%        | 45     | 1.0%   |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                                   | 73     | 0.9%          | 179    | 5.8%        | (120)  | (2.7%) |\n| Impact of UK bank levy being non-deductible                                             | 32     | 0.4%          | 57     | 1.9%        | 43     | 1.0%   |\n| Impact of Barclays Bank PLC's overseas branches being taxed both locally  and in the UK | 25     | 0.3%          | 25     | 0.8%        | 15     | 0.3%   |\n| Tax adjustments in respect of share-based payments                                      | (5)    | (0.1%) (1.7%) | 26     | 0.8% (4.0%) | (6)    | (0.1%) |\n| Changes in recognition of deferred tax and effect of unrecognised tax losses            | (140)  |               | (123)  |             | (82)   | (1.9%) |\n| Tax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments                                       | (149)  | (1.8%)        | (165)  | (5.4%)      | (157)  | (3.6%) |\n| Non-taxable gains and income                                                            | (367)  | (4.4%)        | (208)  | (6.8%)      | (260)  | (6.0%) |\n| Non-recurring items:                                                                    |        |               |        |             |        |        |\n| Remeasurement of UK deferred tax assets due to tax rate changes                         | (462)  | (5.5%)        | (118)  | (3.8%)      | -      | -      |\n| Non-deductible provisions for UK customer redress                                       | -      | -             | (7)    | (0.2%)      | 263    | 6.1%   |\n| Non-deductible provisions for investigations and litigation                             | -      | -             | 5      | 0.2%        | -      | -      |\n| Total tax charge                                                                        | 1,188  | 14.1%         | 604    | 19.7%       | 1,003  | 23.0%  |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## For the year ended 31 December 2021 continued\n\n## 9 Tax continued\n\n## Factors driving the effective tax rate\n\nThe effective tax rate of 14.1% is lower than the UK corporation tax rate of 19% primarily due to adjustments for the remeasurement of UK deferred tax assets as a result of the enactment in 2021 of an increase in the UK corporation tax rate to 25% from 1 April 2023, the impact of non-taxable gains and income, tax relief on payments made under AT1 instruments and the use of unrecognised tax losses in the period. These factors, which have each decreased the effective tax rate, are partially offset by profits earned outside the UK being taxed at local statutory tax rates that are higher than the UK tax rate and non-creditable taxes.\n\nThe Group's future tax charge will be sensitive to the geographic mix of profits earned, the tax rates in force and changes to the tax rules in the jurisdictions that the Group operates in. In its Budget held in October 2021, the UK Government announced that the banking surcharge rate will be reduced from 8% to 3% from 1 April 2023. This reduction in the banking surcharge rate was substantively enacted on 2 February 2022 and is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event. If the reduction in the banking surcharge rate had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date then this would have resulted in the Group's UK deferred tax assets being remeasured and decreasing with a tax charge in the income statement of \u00a3346m and tax credit within other comprehensive income of \u00a387m.\n\nIn October 2021, the OECD and G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting announced plans to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15% from 2023. The model rules, which set out the scope of and the mechanism for calculating the global minimum tax, were released by the OECD on 20 December 2021. The Group is reviewing the model rules and awaiting the OECD's anticipated publication of further guidance, as well as new legislation expected to be released by governments implementing this new tax regime, and will assess the potential impact of new legislation during 2022.\n\nIn the USA, a proposed Build Back Better Act has been passed by the House of Representatives but has not been passed by the Senate and at this time it is uncertain whether the Act will progress further. The proposed Act passed by the House of Representatives included proposals to implement material changes to international tax provisions, including amendments to the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax and the imposition of an alternative minimum tax based on accounting profits. It is unclear at this time whether any of these proposals could have a significant impact on the Group if enacted. The Group will continue to monitor developments and assess the potential impact of any future legislative changes ultimately enacted.\n\nThe tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income can be found in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income which includes within Other a tax credit of \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a35m). The total amount recognised in relation to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax through other comprehensive income was a \u00a3111m charge (2020: \u00a352m).\n\n## Tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income\n\n## Tax included directly in equity\n\n## Deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nTax included directly in equity comprises a \u00a358m credit (2020: \u00a318m) relating to share-based payments and deductible costs on issuing other equity instruments.\n\nThe deferred tax amounts on the balance sheet were as follows:\n\n|                                                             | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| UK Tax Group                                                | 2,183     | 886       |\n| US Intermediate Holding Company Tax Group ('IHC Tax Group') | 1,004     | 1,001     |\n| US Branch Tax Group                                         | 1,002     | 1,048     |\n| Other (outside the UK and US tax groups)                    | 430       | 509       |\n| Deferred tax asset                                          | 4,619     | 3,444     |\n| Deferred tax liability                                      | (37)      | (15)      |\n| Net deferred tax                                            | 4,582     | 3,429     |\n\n## US deferred tax assets in the IHC and US Branch Tax Groups\n\nThe deferred tax asset in the IHC Tax Group of \u00a31,004m (2020: \u00a31,001m) includes \u00a31m (2020: \u00a3nil) relating to tax losses, with the balance relating to temporary differences. The deferred tax asset in Barclays Bank PLC's US Branch Tax Group of \u00a31,002m (2020: \u00a31,048m) relates entirely to temporary differences.\n\nIn relation to the IHC Tax Group, these temporary differences include \u00a3301m  (2020: \u00a3330m) arising from New York State and City prior net operating loss conversion which can be carried forward and will expire in 2034. Business profit forecasts indicate these amounts will be fully recovered before expiry.\n\nThe deferred tax asset in the UK Tax Group of \u00a32,183m (2020: \u00a3886m) includes \u00a31,098m (2020: \u00a3565m) relating to tax losses, with the balance relating to temporary differences.

The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is \u00a31,778m (2020: \u00a31,510m). These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Tax losses and temporary differences\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of \u00a3110m (2020: \u00a3125m), unused tax credits of \u00a3283m (2020: \u00a3236m), and gross tax losses of \u00a322,835m (2020: \u00a320,913m).  The tax losses include capital losses of \u00a33,981m (2020: \u00a33,947m). Of these tax losses, \u00a363m (2020: \u00a3139m) expire within five years, \u00a3370m (2020: \u00a3236m) expire within six to ten years, \u00a310,529m (2020: \u00a37,271m) expire within 11 to 20 years and \u00a311,873m (2020: \u00a313,267m) can be carried forward indefinitely. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which they can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised in respect of the value of the Group's investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of these temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was \u00a30.9bn (2020: \u00a30.8bn).\n\n## Group investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates",

When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all expected dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 435m (2020: 368m) shares. The total number of share options outstanding, under schemes considered to be potentially dilutive, was 688m (2020: 719m). These options have strike prices ranging from \u00a30.84 to \u00a31.66.\n\nOf the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2021, 5m (2020: 69m) were anti-dilutive.\n\nThe 315m decrease (2020: 100m increase) in the basic weighted average number of shares is primarily due to the impact of the share buyback programmes completed in the year.\n\n## 11 Dividends on ordinary shares\n\nThe Directors have approved a total dividend in respect of 2021 of 6p per ordinary share of 25p each. The full year dividend for 2021 of 4p per ordinary share will be paid on 5 April 2022 to shareholders on the Share Register on 4 March 2022. On 31 December 2021, there were 16,752m ordinary shares in issue. The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 do not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Directors have confirmed their intention to initiate a share buyback of up to \u00a31.0bn  after the balance sheet date. The share buyback is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022.  The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 do not reflect the impact of the proposed share buyback, which will be accounted for as and when shares are repurchased by the Company.\n\nThe 2021 financial statements include the 2021 half year dividend of \u00a3339m (2020: nil); a full year dividend declared in relation to 2020 of \u00a3173m (2020: nil) and two share buybacks, \u00a3700m completed in H1 2021 (2020: nil) and \u00a3500m completed in H2 2021 (2020: nil) . Dividends and share buybacks are funded out of distributable reserves.",

They include swaps, forward-rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Group's net interest income, net trading income and derivative assets and liabilities. Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet. Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, credit risk, inflation risk, exchange rate, commodity equity exposures, and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nAll derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives that are in a designated cash flow or net investment hedge accounting relationship. Derivatives are classified as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes terms included in a contract or financial liability (the host), which, had it been a standalone contract, would have met the definition of a derivative. If these are separated from the host, i.e. when the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are not closely related with those of the host contract and the combined instrument is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, then they are accounted for in the same way as derivatives. For financial assets, the requirements are whether the financial assets contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, and consequently the requirements for accounting for embedded derivatives are not applicable to financial assets.\n\nThe Group applies the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for hedge accounting purposes. The Group applies hedge accounting to represent the economic effects of its interest rate, currency and contractually linked inflation risk management strategies. Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.\n\nIn summary, the reliefs provided by the Phase 1 amendments are:\n\nThe Group applies the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform' issued in September 2019 (the Phase 1 amendments). The amendments provide temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR ('Interbank Offered Rates') reform. The reliefs have the effect that IBOR reform should not generally cause hedge accounting to terminate. However, any hedge ineffectiveness continues to be recorded in the income statement. Furthermore, the amendments set out triggers for when the reliefs will end, which include the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform no longer being present.\n\n- \u25a0 When considering the 'highly probable' requirement, the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest rates upon which our hedged items are based do not change as a result of IBOR Reform.\n- \u25a0 The Group will not discontinue hedge accounting during the period of IBOR-related uncertainty solely because the retrospective effectiveness falls outside the required 80-125% range.\n- \u25a0 In assessing whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective on a forward-looking basis the Group has assumed that the IBOR interest rates upon which the cash flows of the hedged items and the interest rate swaps that hedge them are based are not altered by IBOR reform.\n- \u25a0 The Group has not recycled the cash flow hedge reserve relating to the period after the reforms are expected to take effect.\n\nThe Group also applies the 'Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2' issued in August 2020. The Phase 2 amendments provide relief when changes are made to hedge relationships as a result of the interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n- \u25a0 The Group has assessed whether the hedged IBOR risk component is a separately identifiable risk only when it first designates a hedged item in a fair value hedge and not on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## 14 Derivative financial instruments continued\n\nIn summary, the reliefs provided by the Phase 2 amendments are:\n\n- \u25a0 In respect of the retrospective hedge effectiveness assessment, the Group may elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes to zero when the exception to the retrospective assessment ends (Phase 1 relief). Any hedge ineffectiveness will continue to be measured and recognised in full in profit or loss.\n- \u25a0 Under a temporary exception, the Group has considered that changes to the hedge designation and hedge documentation due to the interest rate benchmark reform would not constitute the discontinuation of the hedge relationship nor the designation of a new hedging relationship.\n- \u25a0 The Group has deemed the amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve to be based on the alternative benchmark rate (on which the hedge future cash flows are determined) when there is a change in basis for determining the contractual cash flows.\n- \u25a0 In respect of whether a risk component of a hedged item is separately identifiable, the amendments provide temporary relief to entities to meet this requirement when an alternative risk free rate (RFR) financial instrument is designated as a risk component. These amendments allow the Group upon designation of the hedge to assume that the separately identifiable requirement is met if the Group reasonably expects the RFR risk will become separately identifiable within the next 24 months. The Group applies this relief to each RFR on a rate-by-rate basis and starts when the Group first designates the RFR as a non-contractually specified risk component.\n- \u25a0 For hedges of groups of items (such as those forming part of a macro cash flow hedging strategy), the amendments provide relief for items within a designated group of items that are amended for changes directly required by the reform.\n\n## Fair value hedge accounting\n\nIf hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement. For items classified as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment is included in other comprehensive income.\n\nChanges in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.\n\n## Cash flow hedge accounting\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\n## Hedges of net investments\n\nThe Group's net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings. Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges; the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement. The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Group's investment in the operation.\n\n|                                                                 | Total derivatives         | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   | Total derivatives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                 | 2021                      | 2021                | 2021                | 2020                | 2020                | 2020                |\n|                                                                 |                           | Fair value          | Fair value          | Notional            | Fair value          | Fair value          |\n|                                                                 | Notional contract  amount | Assets              | Liabilities         | contract   amount   | Assets              | Liabilities         |\n|                                                                 | \u00a3m                        | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  | \u00a3m                  |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for trading          | 47,812,774                | 261,678             | (255,747)           | 43,169,971          | 301,880             | (299,795)           |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) held for risk  management | 219,551                   | 894                 | (1,136)             | 189,784             | 566                 | (980)               |\n| Derivative assets/(liabilities)                                 | 48,032,325                | 262,572             | (256,883)           | 43,359,755          | 302,446             | (300,775)           |\n\nAs part of the industry wide IBOR transition during the year, interest rate swap contracts held with Central Clearing Counterparties (CCPs) have been converted to alternative benchmarks.  Operationally, this involved the CCPs splitting each contract into multiple component operational parts in order to preserve accrued IBOR cash flows.  Legally, Barclays remains party to only one contract, and as such all notional amounts quoted in this disclosure reflect the legal contract notional.  In total, 'operational-only' trade notional amounts of  \u00a31,828bn primarily with London Clearing House & Japan Securities Clearing Corporation have been explicitly excluded from these disclosures.\n\nFurther information on netting arrangements of derivative financial instruments can be found within Note 18.",

Interest rate risk also includes exposure to inflation risk for certain types of investments.\n\nHedge accounting is applied predominantly for the following risks:\n\n- \u25a0 Currency risk - arises due to assets or liabilities being denominated in different currencies than the functional currency of the relevant entity. At a consolidated level, currency risk also arises when the functional currency of subsidiaries are different from the parent.\n\nIn order to hedge these risks, the Group uses the following hedging instruments:\n\n- \u25a0 Contractually linked inflation risk - arises from financial instruments within contractually specified inflation risk. The Group does not hedge inflation risk that arises from other activities.\n- \u25a0 Interest rate derivatives to swap interest rate exposures into either fixed or variable rates.\n- \u25a0 Inflation derivatives to swap inflation exposure into either fixed or variable interest rates.\n- \u25a0 Currency derivatives to swap foreign currency exposures into the entity's functional currency, and net investment exposure to local currency.\n\nIn some cases, certain items which are economically hedged may be ineligible hedged items for the purposes of IAS 39, such as core deposits and equity. In these instances, a proxy hedging solution can be utilised whereby portfolios of floating rate assets are designated as eligible hedged items in cash flow hedges.\n\n- \u25a0 Benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the LIBOR or Risk Free Rate (RFR) component.\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group designates risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Inflation risk as a contractually specified component of a debt instrument.\n- \u25a0 Components of cash flows of hedged items, for example certain interest payments for part of the life of an instrument.\n- \u25a0 Spot exchange rate risk for foreign currency financial assets or financial liabilities.\n\nUsing the benchmark interest rate risk results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship. Following market-wide interest rate benchmark reform, sensitivity to risk-free rates is considered to be the predominant interest rate risk and therefore the hedged items (which often reference risk-free or similar 'overnight' rates) change in fair value on a proportionate basis with reference to this risk.\n\nChanges in the GBP value of net investments due to foreign currency movements are captured in the currency translation reserve, resulting in a movement in CET1 capital. The Group mitigates this by matching the CET1 capital movements to the revaluation of the foreign currency RWA exposures. Net investment hedges are designated where necessary to reduce the exposure to movement in a particular exchange rate to within limits mandated by Risk. As far as possible, existing external currency liabilities are designated as the hedging instruments.\n\nIn respect of many of the Group's hedge accounting relationships, the hedged item and hedging instrument change frequently due to the dynamic nature of the risk management and hedge accounting strategy. The Group applies hedge accounting to dynamic scenarios, predominantly in relation to interest rate risk, with a combination of hedged items in order for its financial statements to reflect as closely as possible the economic risk management undertaken. In some cases, if the hedge accounting objective changes, the relevant hedge accounting relationship is de-designated and is replaced with a different hedge accounting relationship.\n\nThe hedging instruments share the same risk exposures as the hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined with reference to quantitative tests, predominantly regression testing, but to the extent hedging instruments are exposed to different risks than the hedged items, this could result in hedge ineffectiveness or hedge accounting failures.\n\n- \u25a0 Mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and hedging instrument, including basis differences.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Changes in credit risk of the hedging instruments.\n- \u25a0 Cash flow hedges using external swaps with non-zero fair values.\n- \u25a0 If a hedging relationship becomes over-hedged, for example in hedges of net investments if the net asset value designated at the start of the period falls below the amount of the hedging instrument.\n- \u25a0 The effects of the reforms to IBOR because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on hedged items and hedging instruments.\n\nThe Group's risk exposure continues, in part, to be affected by interest rate benchmark reform. In most cases, hedged items and hedging instruments are expected to transition to relevant risk-free rates at the end of their current cash flow period. For GBP LIBOR contracts, where uncertainty around the timing and effects of LIBOR reform continues beyond the end of the current cash flow period, financial instruments are generally expected to utilise 'synthetic LIBOR' (as permitted by the FCA on a temporary basis until their contracts are fully remediated). USD LIBOR linked hedge accounting relationships are still exposed to uncertainty regarding the precise timing and effects of benchmark reform. USD LIBOR benchmarks will cease to be published from 30 June 2023, but certain hedged items and hedging instruments continue to contractually reference these benchmarks beyond the cessation date.",

The Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales to establish if the business model is achieved.\n\nFinancial assets that are debt instruments held in a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI are measured at FVOCI. They are subsequently re-measured at fair value and changes therein (except for those relating to impairment, interest income and foreign currency exchange gains and losses) are recognised in other comprehensive income until the assets are sold. Interest (calculated using the effective interest method) is recognised in the income statement in net interest income (Note 3). Upon disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is included in net investment income (Note 6).\n\nFor equity securities that are not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election on initial recognition to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income (except for dividend income which is recognised in profit or loss). Gains or losses on the de-recognition of these equity securities are not transferred to profit or loss. These assets are also not subject to the impairment requirements and therefore no amounts are recycled to the income statement. Where the Group has not made the irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument in other comprehensive income, equity securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n|                                                                   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities and other eligible bills                          | 60,798    | 77,736    |\n| Equity securities                                                 | 902       | 761       |\n| Loans and advances                                                | 53        | 191       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 61,753    | 78,688    |\n\n## 16 Financial liabilities designated at fair value\n\n## Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss\n\nThe details on how the fair value amounts are arrived at for financial liabilities designated at fair value are described in Note 17.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income (Note 5) and net investment income (Note 6). Movements in own credit are reported through other comprehensive income, unless the effects of changes in the liability's credit risk would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in P&L. In these scenarios, all gains and losses on that liability (including the effects of changes in the credit risk of the liability) are presented in P&L. On derecognition of the financial liability no amount relating to own credit risk is recycled to the income statement. The Group has the ability to make the fair value designation when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch (caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value), or is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics (Note 14).\n\n|                                                           | 2021          | 2021                                    | 2020          | 2020                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                           | Fair value \u00a3m | Contractual  amount due  on maturity \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Contractual  amount due  on maturity \u00a3m |\n| Debt securities                                           | 53,647        | 61,946                                  | 50,437        | 57,650                                  |\n| Deposits                                                  | 29,246        | 29,673                                  | 21,706        | 22,107                                  |\n| Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing | 168,060       | 168,129                                 | 177,371       | 177,389                                 |\n| Other financial liabilities                               | 7             | 7                                       | 251           | 251                                     |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value            | 250,960       | 259,755                                 | 249,765       | 257,397                                 |\n\nThe cumulative own credit net loss recognised is \u00a3960m (2020: \u00a3954m loss).",

        "page_content": "## 17 Fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Accounting for financial assets and liabilities - fair values\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition (including transaction costs, other than financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss) and depending on the subsequent classification of the financial asset or liability, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income. The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFinancial instruments that are held for trading are recognised at fair value through profit or loss. In addition, financial assets are held at fair value through profit or loss if they do not contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, or if the financial asset is not held in a business model that is either (i) a business model to collect the contractual cash flows or (ii) a business model that is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling. Subsequent changes in fair value for these instruments are recognised in the income statement in net investment income, except if reporting it in trading income reduces an accounting mismatch.\n\nWherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument. For many of the Group's financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available and valuation models are used to estimate fair value. The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value. These models use as their basis independently sourced market inputs including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.\n\nOn initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary. The best evidence of an instrument's fair value on initial recognition is typically the transaction price. However, if fair value can be evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, or is based on a valuation technique whose inputs include only data from observable markets, then the instrument should be recognised at the fair value derived from such observable market data.\n\nFor financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data such as in primary issuance and redemption activity for structured notes.\n\nFor valuations that have made use of unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price (Day One profit) is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction; or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate; or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.\n\nThe sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to possible changes in significant unobservable inputs is shown on page 374.\n\nVarious factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time. Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction (bespoke or generic). To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependent on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe valuation of financial instruments often involves a significant degree of judgement and complexity, in particular where valuation models make use of unobservable inputs ('Level 3' assets and liabilities). This note provides information on these instruments, including the related unrealised gains and losses recognised in the period, a description of significant valuation techniques and unobservable inputs, and a sensitivity analysis.\n\n## Valuation\n\n## Quoted market prices - Level 1\n\nIFRS 13 Fair value measurement requires an entity to classify its assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that reflects the observability of significant market inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below with judgement applied in determining the boundary between Level 2 and 3 classification.\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market. Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. Valuations based on observable inputs include assets and liabilities such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.\n\n## Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\n## Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price. Unobservable input levels are generally determined via reference to observable inputs, historical observations or using other analytical techniques.",

The calculation is based on range or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on relevant market analysis alongside the impact of using alternative models. Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.\n\nSensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of the valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.\n\nThe valuation techniques used, observability and sensitivity analysis for material products within Level 3, are described below.\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to interest rates or inflation indices. The category includes futures, interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nValuation: Interest rate and inflation derivatives are generally valued using curves of forward rates constructed from market data to project and discount the expected future cash flows of trades. Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market inputs, and use industry standard or bespoke models depending on the product type.\n\nObservability: In general, inputs are considered observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques or inferred via another reasonable method.",

        "page_content": "## 17 Fair value of financial instruments continued\n\n## Foreign exchange derivatives\n\nValuation: FX derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models depending on the product type. Valuation inputs include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to the foreign exchange (FX) market. The category includes FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options. The majority are traded as over the counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nObservability: FX correlations, forwards and volatilities are generally observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nUnobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Derivatives linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities or a pool of referenced assets (e.g. a securitised product). The category includes single name and index credit default swaps (CDS) and total return swaps (TRS).\n\nObservability : CDS contracts referencing entities that are actively traded are generally considered observable. Other valuation inputs are considered observable if products with significant sensitivity to the inputs are actively traded in a liquid market. Unobservable valuation inputs are generally determined with reference to recent transactions or inferred from observable trades of the same issuer or similar entities.\n\nValuation: CDS are valued on industry standard models using curves of credit spreads as the principal input. Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.\n\n## Equity derivatives\n\nValuation: Equity derivatives are valued using industry standard models. Valuation inputs include stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repurchase curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.\n\nDescription : Exchange traded or OTC derivatives linked to equity indices and single names. The category includes vanilla and exotic equity products.\n\nObservability : In general, valuation inputs are observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each input and underlying. Unobservable inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Primarily corporate bonds.\n\n## Corporate debt\n\nValuation: Corporate bonds are valued using observable market prices sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing sources.\n\n## Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements\n\nObservability: Prices for actively traded bonds are considered observable. Unobservable bonds prices are generally determined by reference to bond yields or CDS spreads for actively traded instruments issued by or referencing the same (or a similar) issuer.\n\nDescription: Includes securities purchased under resale agreements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other similar secured lending agreements. The agreements are primarily short-term in nature.\n\nObservability: Inputs are deemed observable up to liquid maturities, and are determined based on the specific features of the transaction. Unobservable inputs are generally set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nValuation: Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are generally valued by discounting the expected future cash flows using industry standard models that incorporate market interest rates and repurchase rates, based on the specific details of the transaction.\n\n## Non-asset backed loans\n\nValuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows based on interest rates and loan spreads.\n\nDescription: Largely made up of fixed rate loans.\n\nObservability: Within this loan population, the loan spread is generally unobservable. Unobservable loan spreads are determined by incorporating funding costs, the level of comparable assets such as gilts, issuer credit quality and other factors.\n\nDescription: Securities that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation. The category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, CDOs, collateralised loan obligations (CLOs) and other asset backed securities.\n\n## Asset backed securities\n\nValuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices. Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard discounted cash flow analysis that calculates the fair value based on valuation inputs such as constant default rate, conditional prepayment rate, loss given default and yield. These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.\n\nObservability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis, the instrument is considered unobservable.\n\nProxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities' underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition (historical losses, borrower characteristics and loan attributes such as loan to value ratio and geographic concentration) and credit ratings (original and current).",

Unobservable equity prices are generally determined by reference to actively traded instruments that are similar in nature, or inferred via another reasonable method.\n\nDescription: Includes investments in equity holdings in operating companies not quoted on a public exchange.\n\n## Private equity investments\n\nValuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines' which require the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed companies. While the valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.\n\n## Other\n\nObservability : Inputs are considered observable if there is active trading in a liquid market of products with significant sensitivity to the inputs.

The table shows gains and losses and includes amounts for all financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value transferred to and from Level 3 during the period. Transfers have been reflected as if they had taken place at the beginning of the year.",

Points are a percentage of par; for example, 100 points equals 100% of par. A basis point equals 1/100th of 1%; for example, 150 basis points equals 1.5%.\n- a A range has not been provided for Net Asset Value as there would be a wide range reflecting the diverse nature of the positions.\n- c Certain derivative instruments are classified as Level 3 due to a significant unobservable credit spread input into the calculation of the Credit Valuation Adjustment for the instruments. The range of significant unobservable credit spreads is between 32-1848bps (2020: 17-1,831bps).\n\nThe following section describes the significant unobservable inputs identified in the table above, and the sensitivity of fair value measurement of the instruments categorised as Level 3 assets or liabilities to increases in significant unobservable inputs. Where sensitivities are described, the inverse relationship will also generally apply.\n\n## Forwards\n\nWhere reliable interrelationships can be identified between significant unobservable inputs used in fair value measurement, a description of those interrelationships is included below.\n\nA price or rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will take place in the future.\n\n## Credit spread\n\nIn general, a significant increase in a forward in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the contracted receiver of the underlying (currency, bond, commodity, etc.), but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nCredit spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Credit spreads reflect the additional yield that a market participant demands for taking on exposure to the credit risk of an instrument and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.",

It is an estimate of how much a particular underlying instrument input or index will change in value over time. In general, volatilities are implied from observed option prices. For unobservable options the implied volatility may reflect additional assumptions about the nature of the underlying risk, and the strike/maturity profile of a specific contract.\n\nThere may be interrelationships between unobservable volatilities and other unobservable inputs (e.g. when equity prices fall, implied equity volatilities generally rise) but these are generally specific to individual markets and may vary over time.\n\nIn general a significant increase in volatility in isolation will result in a fair value increase for the holder of a simple option, but the sensitivity is dependent on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\n## Correlation\n\nA significant increase in correlation in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation can be a significant input into valuation of derivative contracts with more than one underlying instrument. Credit correlation generally refers to the correlation between default processes for the separate names that make up the reference pool of a CDO structure.\n\n## Comparable price\n\nIn general, a significant increase in comparable price in isolation will result in an increase in the price of the unobservable instrument. For derivatives, a change in the comparable price in isolation can result in a fair value increase or decrease depending on the specific terms of the instrument.\n\nComparable instrument prices are used in valuation by calculating an implied yield (or spread over a liquid benchmark) from the price of a comparable observable instrument, then adjusting that yield (or spread) to account for relevant differences such as maturity or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable and unobservable instruments in order to establish a value.\n\n## Loan spread\n\nThe ESHLA portfolio primarily consists of long-dated fixed rate loans extended to counterparties in the UK Education, Social Housing and Local Authority sectors. The loans are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their illiquid nature and the significance of unobservable loan spreads to the valuation. Valuation uncertainty arises from the long-dated nature of the portfolio, the lack of secondary market in the loans and the lack of observable loan spreads. The majority of ESHLA loans are to borrowers in heavily regulated sectors that are considered extremely low credit risk, and have a history of near zero defaults since inception. While the overall loan spread range is from 31bps to 1,552bps (2020: 31bps to 1,518bps), the vast majority of spreads are concentrated towards the bottom end of this range, with 97% of the loan notional being valued with spreads less than 200bps consistently for both years.\n\nLoan spreads typically represent the difference in yield between an instrument and a benchmark security or reference rate. Loan spreads typically reflect credit quality, the level of comparable assets such as gilts and other factors, and form part of the yield used in a discounted cash flow calculation.\n\nIn general, a significant increase in loan spreads in isolation will result in a fair value decrease for a loan.\n\nEBITDA multiple is the ratio of the valuation of the investment to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.\n\n## EBITDA multiple\n\nIn general, a significant increase in the multiple will result in a fair value increase for an investment.\n\n|                              | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   | Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                              | 2021                                                           | 2021                                                           | Unfavourable changes                                           | Unfavourable changes                                           | 2020 Favourable changes                                        | 2020 Favourable changes                                        | Unfavourable changes                                           | Unfavourable changes                                           |\n|                              | Favourable changes Income  statement                           | Equity                                                         | Income  statement                                              | Equity                                                         | Income  statement                                              | Equity                                                         | Income  statement                                              | Equity                                                         |\n|                              | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             | \u00a3m                                                             |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | 51                                                             | -

Less liquid instruments may not have a directly observable bid-offer level. In such instances, an exit price adjustment may be derived from an observable bid-offer level for a comparable liquid instrument, or determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario or historical analysis.\n\nThe Group uses mid-market pricing where it is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price (which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets). For other financial assets and liabilities, bid-offer adjustments are recorded to reflect the exit level for the expected close out strategy. The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio involves calculating the net risk exposure by offsetting long and short positions by strike and term in accordance with the risk management and hedging strategy.\n\nExit price adjustments derived from market bid-offer spreads have increased by \u00a313m to \u00a3506m.\n\n## Collateralised\n\n## Discounting approaches for derivative instruments\n\nIn line with market practice, the methodology for discounting collateralised derivatives takes into account the nature and currency of the collateral that can be posted within the relevant credit support annex (CSA). The CSA aware discounting approach recognises the 'cheapest to deliver' option that reflects the ability of the party posting collateral to change the currency of the collateral.\n\nA fair value adjustment of \u00a3127m is applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivative portfolios and collateralised derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not allow the rehypothecation of collateral received. This adjustment is referred to as the Funding Fair Value Adjustment (FFVA). FFVA has increased by \u00a312m to \u00a3127m as a result of underlying moves in the exposure profile of the derivative portfolio in scope.\n\n## Uncollateralised\n\n## Derivative credit and debit valuation adjustments\n\nExposure at default is generally estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors through approximating with a more vanilla structure, or by using current or scenario-based mark to market as an estimate of future exposure.\n\nCVA and DVA are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays' own credit quality respectively. These adjustments are calculated for uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives across all asset classes. CVA and DVA are calculated using estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, at a counterparty level. Counterparties include (but are not limited to) corporates, sovereigns and sovereign agencies and supranationals.\n\nProbability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets. Where this information is not available, or considered unreliable, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.\n\nCorrelation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors, termed 'wrong-way,' or 'right-way' risk, is not systematically incorporated into the CVA calculation but is adjusted where the underlying exposure is directly related to the counterparty.\n\nCVA decreased by \u00a356m to \u00a3212m as a result of tightening input counterparty credit spreads. DVA decreased by \u00a322m to \u00a391m as a result of tightening input own credit spreads.\n\nBarclays continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to uncollateralised derivative valuation remains appropriate.\n\nThe Group uses the portfolio exemption in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement to measure the fair value of groups of financial assets and liabilities. Instruments are measured using the price that would be received to sell a net long position (i.e. an asset) for a particular risk exposure or to transfer a net short position (i.e. a liability) for a particular risk exposure in an orderly transaction between market participants at the balance sheet date under current market conditions. Accordingly, the Group measures the fair value of the group of financial assets and liabilities consistently with how market participants would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date.\n\n## Portfolio exemptions",

There are additions of \u00a359m (2020: \u00a327m), and amortisation and releases of \u00a342m (2020: \u00a324m) for financial instruments measured at fair value and additions of \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a36m) and amortisation and releases of \u00a317m (2020: \u00a314m) for financial instruments measured at amortised cost.\n\nStructured and brokered certificates of deposit issued by Barclays are insured up to $250,000 per depositor by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in the US. The FDIC is funded by premiums that Barclays and other banks pay for deposit insurance coverage. The carrying value of these issued certificates of deposit that are designated under the IFRS 9 fair value option includes this third party credit enhancement. The on-balance sheet value of these brokered certificates of deposit amounted to \u00a3790m (2020: \u00a31,494m).\n\nThe following table summarises the fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost on the Group's balance sheet:\n\n## Comparison of carrying amounts and fair values for assets and liabilities not held at fair value\n\n|                                                                  | 2021                                 | 2021            | 2021    | 2021       | 2021           | 2020             | 2020                          | 2020    | 2020       | 2020           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|---------|------------|----------------|\n|                                                                  | Carrying  amount                     | Fair value      | Level 1 | Level 2    | Level 3        | Carrying  amount | Fair value                    | Level 1 | Level 2    | Level 3        |\n| As at 31 December                                                | \u00a3m                                   | \u00a3m              | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m             |\n| Financial assets                                                 |                                      |                 |         |            |                |                  |                               |         |            |                |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                             |                                      | 361,451 362,424 | 17,381  |            | 83,191 261,852 |                  | 342,632 340,516               | 8,824   |            | 81,322 250,370 |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar  secured lending | 3,227                                | 3,227           | -       | 3,227      | -              | 9,031            | 9,031                         | -       | 9,031      | -              |\n| Financial liabilities                                            |                                      |                 |         |            |                |                  |                               |         |            |                |\n| Deposits at amortised cost                                       | (519,433)(519,436)(434,431) (83,501) |                 |         |            | (1,504)        |                  | (481,036) (481,106) (396,124) |         | (82,874)   | (2,108)        |\n| Repurchase agreements and other similar secured                  |                                      |                 |         |            |                |                  |                               |         |            |                |\n| borrowing                                                        | (28,352) (28,358)                    |                 |         | - (28,358) | -              | (14,174)         | (14,174)                      |         | - (14,174) | -              |\n| Debt securities in issue                                         | (98,867) (100,657)                   |                 |         | - (98,364) | (2,293)        | (75,796)         | (77,813)                      |         | - (75,957) | (1,856)        |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                         | (12,759) (13,334)                    |                 |         | - (13,267) | (67)           | (16,341)         | (16,918)                      |         | - (16,918) | -              |\n\nThe fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may not be appropriate to directly compare this fair value information to independent market sources or other financial institutions. Different valuation methodologies and assumptions can have a significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.\n\nThe carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the relevant accounting policy in Note 19.\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Loans and advances at amortised cost\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances, for the purpose of this disclosure, is derived from discounting expected cash flows in a way that reflects the current market price for lending to issuers of similar credit quality. Where market data or credit information on the underlying borrowers is unavailable, a number of proxy/extrapolation techniques are employed to determine the appropriate discount rates.\n\nThe fair value of reverse repurchase agreements approximates carrying amount as these balances are generally short dated and fully collateralised.\n\nThe carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost is determined in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 1.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Deposits at amortised cost\n\nThe fair value for deposits with longer-term maturities, mainly time deposits, are estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities. Consequently, the fair value discount is minimal.\n\nIn many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently, such as customer accounts and other deposits and short-term debt securities.\n\n## Repurchase agreements and other similar secured borrowing\n\n## Debt securities in issue\n\nThe fair value of repurchase agreements approximates carrying amounts as these balances are generally short dated.\n\nFair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where the instruments are short dated, carrying amount approximates fair value.\n\nFair values for dated and undated convertible and non-convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issuer concerned or issuers with similar terms and conditions.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities",

Details regarding the Group's liquidity and capital position can be found in the Treasury and capital risk section.\n\n## 19 Loans and advances and deposits at amortised cost\n\n## Accounting for loans and advances and deposits held at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held in a business model to collect the contractual cash flows and that contain contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these financial assets at initial recognition includes any directly attributable transaction costs. Refer to Note 1 for details on 'solely payments of principal and interest'.\n\nLoans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and most financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost. That is, the initial fair value (which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed) is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability. Balances deferred on-balance sheet as effective interest rate adjustments are amortised to interest income over the life of the financial instrument to which they relate.\n\nIn determining whether the business model is a 'hold to collect' model, the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows rather than holding the financial asset for trading or short-term profit taking purposes. While the objective of the business model must be to hold the financial asset to collect contractual cash flows this does not mean the Group is required to hold the financial assets until maturity. When determining if the business model objective is to collect contractual cash flows the Group will consider past sales and expectations about future sales.\n\nLoans and advances and deposits at amortised cost\n\n| As at 31 December                                 | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost to banks     | 9,698     | 8,900     |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost to customers | 319,922   | 309,927   |\n| Debt securities at amortised cost                 | 31,831    | 23,805    |\n| Total loans and advances at amortised cost        | 361,451   | 342,632   |\n| Deposits at amortised cost from banks             | 17,819    | 17,343    |\n| Deposits at amortised cost from customers         | 501,614   | 463,693   |\n| Total deposits at amortised cost                  | 519,433   | 481,036   |\n\n## 20 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in enhancement of the asset.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.\n\nDepreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances. The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating depreciation                                            | Depreciation rate                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Freehold land                                                                       | Not depreciated                      |\n| Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property (more than 50 years to run)          | 2-3.3%                               |\n| Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease (less than 50 years to run) | Over the remaining life of the lease |\n| Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property                              | 6-10%                                |\n| Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property                              | 6-10%                                |\n| Computers and similar equipment                                                     | 17-33%                               |\n| Fixtures and fittings and other equipment                                           | 9-20%                                |\n\nCosts of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the lease or the depreciation rates noted in the table above.",

IFRS 16 includes an accounting policy choice for a lessee to elect not to apply IFRS 16 to remaining assets within the scope of IAS 38 Intangible Assets which the Group has decided to apply.\n\n- \u25a0 A lease liability, measured at the present value of remaining cash flows on the lease, and\n\nSubsequently the lease liability will increase for the accrual of interest, resulting in a constant rate of return throughout the life of the lease, and reduce when payments are made. The right of use asset will amortise to the income statement over the life of the lease. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in one of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 A right of use (ROU) asset, measured at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made prior to commencement date, initial direct costs, and estimated costs of restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lease, less any lease incentives received.\n- \u25a0 Future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate;\n- \u25a0 The Group's assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n- \u25a0 The Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU asset, or is recorded in the income statement if the carrying amount of the ROU asset has been reduced to nil.\n\nThe Group applies the recognition exemption in IFRS 16 for leases with a term not exceeding 12 months. For these leases the lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.\n\nOn the balance sheet, the ROU assets are included within property, plant and equipment and the lease liabilities are included within other liabilities.\n\nWhen the Group is the lessor, the lease must be classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee. An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased asset remain with the lessor.\n\nWhen the lease is deemed an operating lease, the lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. The Group holds the leased assets on-balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.\n\nWhen the lease is deemed a finance lease, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet; instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.\n\n## As a Lessor\n\nThe following table sets out a maturity analysis of lease receivables, showing the lease payments to be received after the reporting date.\n\nFinance lease receivables are included within loans and advances at amortised cost.\n\n|                        | 2021                                             | 2021                   | 2021                                                   | 2021                          | 2020                                             | 2020                   | 2020                                                   | 2020                          |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                        | Gross  investment in  finance lease  receivables | Future finance  income | Present value  of minimum  lease  payments  receivable | Unguaranteed  residual values | Gross  investment in  finance lease  receivables | Future finance  income | Present value  of minimum  lease  payments  receivable | Unguaranteed  residual values |\n|                        | \u00a3m                                               | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                                                     | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m                                               | \u00a3m                     | \u00a3m                                                     | \u00a3m                            |\n| Not more than one year | 29                                               | (3)                    | 26                                                     | -                             | 535                                              | (26)                   | 509                                                    | 70                            |\n| One to two year        | 19                                               | (2)                    | 17                                                     | -                             | 312                                              | (15)                   | 297                                                    | 45                            |\n| Two to three year      | 6                                                | -                      | 6                                                      | -                             | 215                                              | (12)                   | 203                                                    | 52                            |\n| Three to four year     | 2                                                | -                      | 2                                                      | -                             | 107                                              | (6)                    | 101                                                    | 27                            |\n| Four to five year      | 1                                                | -                      | 1                                                      | -                             | 52                                               | (3)                    | 49                                                     | 18                            |\n| Over five years        | 1                                                | -                      | 1                                                      | -                             | 24                                               | (1)                    | 23                                                     | 13                            |\n| Total                  | 58                                               | (5)                    | 53                                                     | -                             | 1,245                                            | (63)                   | 1,182                                                  | 225                           |\n\nBarclays Asset Finance provided leasing and other asset finance facilities across a broad range of asset types to business and individual customers.

The above gross cash flows have been reduced by \u00a3434m (2020: \u00a3446m) for leases where Barclays is highly expected to exercise an early termination option. However, there is no significant impact where Barclays is expected to exercise an extension option.\n- \u25a0 Variable lease payments: This variability will typically arise from either inflation index instruments or market based pricing adjustments. Currently, Barclays has 609 (2020: 809) leases out of the total 1,111 (2020: 1,329) leases which have variable lease payment terms based on market based pricing adjustments. Of the gross cash flows identified above, \u00a31,196m (2020: \u00a31,096m) is attributable to leases with some degree of variability predominately linked to market based pricing adjustments.\n- \u25a0 In 2021, the Group recorded a gain on sale relating to a sale and leaseback transaction of the Monaco branch premises of \u00a333m.\n- \u25a0 The  Group does not have any restrictions or covenants imposed by the lessor on its property leases which restrict its businesses.",

The test involves comparing the carrying value of a cash generating unit (CGU) including goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the CGU to which the goodwill relates, or the CGU's fair value if this is higher.\n\nIntangible assets other than goodwill are accounted for in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.\n\nFor internally generated intangible assets, only costs incurred during the development phase are capitalised. Expenditure in the research phase is expensed when it is incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.\n\nIntangible assets are stated at cost (which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value) less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally using the amortisation periods set out below:\n\n| Annual rates in calculating amortisation   | Amortisation period   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Goodwill                                   | Not amortised         |\n| Internally generated software a            | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Other software                             | 12 months to 6 years  |\n| Customer lists                             | 12 months to 25 years |\n| Licences and other                         | 12 months to 25 years |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Exceptions to the above rate relate to useful lives of certain core banking platforms that are assessed individually and, if appropriate, amortised over longer periods ranging from 10 to 15 years.\n\nIntangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.

Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing. The review of goodwill for impairment involves calculating a value in use (VIU) valuation which is compared to the carrying value of a CGU associated with the goodwill to determine whether any impairment has occurred. This includes the identification of independent CGUs across the organisation and the allocation of goodwill to those CGUs.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe calculation of a value in use contains a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the future cash flows and the rates used to discount them. Key judgements include determining the carrying value of the CGU, the cash flows and discount rates used in the calculation.\n\n- \u25a0 The discount rates applied to the future cash flows also involve judgement as they can have a significant impact on the valuation. The discount rates used are compared to market participants to ensure that they are appropriate and based on an estimated cost of equity for each CGU.\n- \u25a0 The cash flow forecasts used by management involve judgement and are based upon a view of the future prospects of the business and market conditions at the point in time the assessment is prepared. The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding long-term sustainable cash flows.\n- \u25a0 The choice of a terminal growth rate used to determine the present value of the future cash flows of the CGUs is also a judgement that can impact the outcome of the assessment. The terminal growth rate and discount rates used may vary due to external market rates and economic conditions that are beyond management's control.\n\n## 2021 impairment review\n\nFurther details of some of the key judgements are set out below.\n\nThe 2021 impairment review was performed during Q4 2021. In comparison to the prior year, the macroeconomic outlook has improved, with expectations of increased interest rates.  However, unsecured balances are lower, reflecting reduced borrowing and higher repayments by customers. These factors impact favourably and adversely on the operating environments of the CGUs. A detailed assessment has been performed, with the approach and results of this analysis set out below.\n\nThe carrying value for each CGU is the sum of the tangible equity, goodwill and intangible asset balances associated with that CGU.\n\n## Determining the carrying value of CGUs\n\nThe Group manages the assets and liabilities of its CGUs with reference to the tangible equity of the respective businesses. That tangible equity is derived from the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU and therefore reflects its relative risk, as well as the level of capital that management consider a market participant would be required to hold and retain to support business growth.\n\n## Cash flows\n\nThe goodwill held across the Group has been allocated to the CGU where it originated, based upon historical records. The intangible asset balances are allocated to the CGUs based upon their expected usage of these assets.\n\nThe five-year cash flows used in the calculation are based on the formally agreed medium term plans approved by the Board. These are prepared using macroeconomic assumptions which management consider reasonable and supportable, and reflect business agreed initiatives for the forecast period. The macroeconomic assumptions underpinning the medium term plan were determined in August 2021 and management has considered whether there are subsequent significant changes in those assumptions which would adversely impact the results of the impairment review.\n\nIn line with prior year treatment, the Education, Social Housing and Local Authority (ESHLA) portfolio has been excluded from the Business Banking CGU cash flows. This is a legacy loan portfolio which was previously within the Non-Core bank and was not part of the business to which the goodwill relates. As such, the cash flows relating to this portfolio have been excluded from the Business Banking VIU calculation.\n\nAs required by IAS 36, all estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows that are expected to arise from restructuring initiatives where a constructive obligation to carry out the plan does not yet exist.\n\nThe Personal Banking CGU cash flows reflect increases in the yield curve observed during the course of 2021 and have not been extended to a sixth year. The 2020 impairment review used a sixth year to reflect an observed 15bp inflexion point in the yield curve which was beyond the period of the medium term plan.\n\nIAS 36 requires that the discount rate used in a value in use calculation reflects the pre-tax rate an investor would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate similar cash flows to those that the entity expects to generate from the asset. In determining the discount rate, management have identified the cost of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble the Group's CGUs and adjusted them for tax to arrive at the pre-tax equivalent rate. A range of discount rates have been used across the CGUs ranging from 12.5% to 15.1% (2020: 12.0% to 16.3%).\n\n## Discount rates",

It is management's judgement that the cash flows associated with the CGUs will grow in line with the major economies in which the Group operates. Inflation rates are used as an approximation of future growth rates and form the basis of the terminal growth rates applied. The terminal growth rate used is 2.0% (2020: 2.0%).\n\nThe Personal Banking and Business Banking retail banking CGUs carry the majority of the Group's goodwill balance, predominantly as a consequence of the Woolwich acquisition. The goodwill within Personal Banking was \u00a32,752m (2020: \u00a32,752m), of which \u00a32,501m (2020: \u00a32,501m) was attributable to Woolwich, and within Business Banking was \u00a3629m (2020: \u00a3629m), fully attributable to Woolwich. The recoverable amount for both Personal Banking and Business Banking have increased in comparison to the 2020 impairment review, reflective of improvements in the interest rate and macroeconomic outlook.\n\nBased on management's plans and assumptions the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGUs and no impairment has been indicated.\n\nThe largest portion of the Group's intangible assets sit within the Cards and Payments CGU, with an allocation of \u00a31,351m (2020: \u00a31,096m). The extent to which the recoverable amount of the Cards and Payments CGU exceeds its carrying value has reduced in comparison to the 2020 impairment review as a result of investment in new intangible assets and a reduction in card balances, reflecting reduced borrowing and higher repayments by customers.\n\nThe outcome of the impairment review for Personal Banking, Business Banking and Cards and Payments  are set out below:\n\n| Cash generating unit   | Tangible equity \u00a3m   | Goodwill \u00a3m   | Intangibles \u00a3m   | Carrying value \u00a3m   | Value in use \u00a3m   | Value in use  exceeding carrying  value \u00a3m   | Value in use  exceeding carrying  value 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|----------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Personal Banking       | 5,194                | 2,752         | 997              | 8,943               | 10,432            | 1,489                                        | 123                                               |\n| Business Banking       | 1,459                | 629           | 169              | 2,257               | 5,880             | 3,623                                        | 740                                               |\n| Cards and Payments     | 2,946                | 195           | 1,351            | 4,492               | 5,517             | 1,025                                        | 1,360                                             |\n| Total                  | 9,599                | 3,576         | 2,517            | 15,692              | 21,829            | 6,137                                        | 2,223                                             |\n\n## Sensitivity of key judgements\n\nCash flows: The medium term plans used to determine the cash flows used in the VIU calculation rely on macroeconomic forecasts, including interest rates, GDP and unemployment, and forecast levels of market and client activity. Interest rate assumptions impact planned cash flows from both customer income and structural hedge contributions and therefore cash flow expectations are highly sensitive to movements in the yield curve. The cash flows also contain assumptions with regards to the prudential and financial conduct regulatory environment which may be subject to change. Given the current level of economic uncertainty, a 10% reduction in cash flows has been provided to show the sensitivity of the outcome to a change in these key assumptions.\n\nThe CGUs are sensitive to possible adverse changes in the key assumptions that support the recoverable amount:\n\nDiscount rate: The discount rate should reflect the market risk-free rate adjusted for the inherent risks of the business it is applied to. Management have identified discount rates for comparable businesses and consider these to be a reasonable estimate of a suitable market rate for the profile of the business unit being tested. The risk that these discount rates may not be appropriate is quantified below and shows the impact of a 100 bps change in the discount rate.\n\nAllocated capital rate: Tangible equity is allocated based on the level of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and capital required to be deployed in the CGU which is dependent on the relative risk of businesses. The capital ratio used in determining the level of tangible equity allocated to the CGU and its capital cash flows could move over time. The impact of a 50bps increase in capital ratio is quantified below.\n\nTerminal growth rate: The terminal growth rate is used to estimate the cash flows into perpetuity based on the expected longevity of the CGUs' businesses. The terminal growth rate is sensitive to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The risk that using inflation data may not be appropriate for its determination is quantified below and shows the impact of 100 bps change in the terminal growth rate.\n\nThe sensitivity of the value in use to key judgements in the calculations is set out below:\n\n|                      |                    |                  |                                              |                  |                          | Reduction in headroom                        | Reduction in headroom                           | Reduction in headroom                             | Reduction in headroom                         | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   | Change required to reduce headroom to zero   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Cash generating unit | Carrying  value \u00a3m | Value in  use \u00a3m | Value in  use  exceeding  carrying  value \u00a3m | Discount  rate % | Terminal  growth  rate % | 100 bps  increase  in the  discount  rate \u00a3m | 100 bps  decrease  in terminal  growth  rate \u00a3m | 50 bps  increase  to  allocated  capital  rate \u00a3m | 10%  reduction  in  forecasted  cash flows \u00a3m | Discount  rate %                             | Terminal  growth  rate %                     | Allocated  capital  rate %                   | Cashflows %                                  |\n| Personal Banking     | 8,943              | 10,432           | 1,489                                        | 14.2             | 2.0                      | (946)                                        | (655)                                           | (291)                                             | (1,219)                                       | 1.7                                          | (2.6)                                        | 2.6                                          | (12.2)                                       |\n| Cards and Payments   | 4,492              | 5,517            | 1,025                                        | 14.7             | 2.0                      | (597)                                        | (433)                                           | (227)                                             | (774)                                         | 1.8                                          | (2.7)                                        | 2.3                                          | (13.3)                                       |\n| Total                | 13,435             | 15,949           | 2,514                                        |                  |                          |                                              |                                                 |                                                   |                                               |                                              |                                              |                                              |                                              |",

Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs, when an obligation exists; for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe complexity of such matters often requires the input of specialist professional advice in making assessments to produce estimates. Customer redress and legal, competition and regulatory matters are areas where a higher degree of professional judgement is required. The amount that is recognised as a provision can also be very sensitive to the assumptions made in calculating it. This gives rise to a large range of potential outcomes which require judgement in determining an appropriate provision level. See Note 26 for more detail of legal, competition and regulatory matters.\n\nThe financial reporting of provisions involves a significant degree of judgement and is complex. Identifying whether a present obligation exists and estimating the probability, timing, nature and quantum of the outflows that may arise from past events requires judgements to be made based on the specific facts and circumstances relating to individual events and often requires specialist professional advice. When matters are at an early stage, accounting judgements and estimates can be difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty involved. Management continues to monitor matters as they develop to re-evaluate on an ongoing basis whether provisions should be recognised, however there can remain a wide range of possible outcomes and uncertainties, particularly in relation to legal, competition and regulatory matters, and as a result it is often not practicable to make meaningful estimates even when matters are at a more advanced stage.\n\n|                              | Onerous  contracts \u00a3m   | Redundancy  and  restructuring \u00a3m   | Undrawn  contractually  committed  facilities and  guarantees a \u00a3m   | Customer  redress \u00a3m   | Legal,  competition  and regulatory  matters \u00a3m   | Sundry  provisions \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| As at 1 January 2021         | 28                      | 158                                 | 1,064                                                                | 497                    | 268                                               | 289                     | 2,304      |\n| Additions                    | 6                       | 316                                 | 124                                                                  | 188                    | 72                                                | 198                     | 904        |\n| Amounts utilised             | (11)                    | (82)                                | -                                                                    | (318)                  | (62)                                              | (140)                   | (613)      |\n| Unused amounts reversed      | (18)                    | (25)                                | (638)                                                                | (54)                   | (44)                                              | (101)                   | (880)      |\n| Exchange and other movements | -                       | (41)                                | (8)                                                                  | (3)                    | (8)                                               | 33                      | (27)       |\n| As at 31 December 2021       | 5                       | 326                                 | 542                                                                  | 310                    | 226                                               | 279                     | 1,688      |\n\n## Note\n\nProvisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31 December 2021 were \u00a31,534m (2020: \u00a31,751m).\n\n- a Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees provisions are accounted for under IFRS 9.",

Additions made during the year relate to formal restructuring plans and have either been utilised, or reversed where total costs are now expected to be lower than the original provision amount.\n\nImpairment allowance under IFRS 9 considers both the drawn and the undrawn counterparty exposure. For retail portfolios, the total impairment allowance is allocated to the drawn exposure to the extent that the allowance does not exceed the exposure as ECL is not reported separately. Any excess is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For wholesale portfolios, the impairment allowance on the undrawn exposure is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as a provision. For further information, refer to the Credit risk section for loan commitments and financial guarantees on page 233.\n\n## Undrawn contractually committed facilities and guarantees\n\n## Customer redress\n\n## Legal, competition and regulatory matters\n\nCustomer redress provisions comprise the estimated cost of making redress payments to customers, clients and counterparties for losses or damages associated with inappropriate judgement in the execution of the Group's business activities.\n\nThe Group is engaged in various legal proceedings, both in the UK and a number of other overseas jurisdictions, including the US. For further information in relation to legal proceedings and discussion of the associated uncertainties, refer to Note 26.\n\nThis category includes provisions that do not fit into any of the other categories, such as fraud losses and dilapidation provisions.\n\n## Sundry provisions\n\n## 25 Contingent liabilities and commitments\n\n## Accounting for contingent liabilities\n\nThe following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on-balance sheet:\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\n|                                                                     | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security     | 15,549    | 15,665    |\n| Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements                | 5,797     | 5,944     |\n| Total contingent liabilities and financial guarantees               | 21,346    | 21,609    |\n| Of which: Financial guarantees carried at fair value                | 231       | 229       |\n| Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions | 1,584     | 1,086     |\n| Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments              | 344,127   | 331,963   |\n| Total commitments                                                   | 345,711   | 333,049   |\n| Of which: Loan commitments carried at fair value                    | 18,571    | 9,269     |\n\nExpected credit losses held against contingent liabilities and commitments equal \u00a3542m (2020: \u00a31,064m) and are reported in Note 24.

We have not disclosed an estimate of the potential financial impact or effect on the Group of contingent liabilities where it is not currently practicable to do so. Various matters detailed in this note seek damages of an unspecified amount. While certain matters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amounts do not necessarily reflect the Group's potential financial exposure in respect of those matters.\n\nThe Group faces legal, competition and regulatory challenges, many of which are beyond our control. The extent of the impact of these matters cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our operations, financial results, condition and prospects. Matters arising from a set of similar circumstances can give rise to either a contingent liability or a provision, or both, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.\n\nMatters are ordered under headings corresponding to the financial statements in which they are disclosed.\n\n## Investigations into certain advisory services agreements\n\n## 1. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC\n\n## FCA proceedings\n\n## Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions\n\nIn 2008, Barclays Bank PLC and Qatar Holdings LLC entered into two advisory service agreements (the Agreements). The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) conducted an investigation into whether the Agreements may have related to Barclays PLC's capital raisings in June and November 2008 (the Capital Raisings) and therefore should have been disclosed in the announcements or public documents relating to the Capital Raisings. In 2013, the FCA issued warning notices (the Notices) finding that Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC acted recklessly and in breach of certain disclosure-related listing rules, and that Barclays PLC was also in breach of Listing Principle 3. The financial penalty provided in the Notices is \u00a350m. Barclays PLC and Barclays Bank PLC continue to contest the findings. Following the conclusion of the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) proceedings against certain former Barclays executives resulting in their acquittals, the FCA proceedings, which were stayed, have resumed and a hearing before the Regulatory Decisions Committee is scheduled for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nRegulators and law enforcement agencies, including certain competition authorities, from a number of governments have conducted investigations relating to Barclays Bank PLC's involvement in allegedly manipulating certain financial benchmarks, such as LIBOR. Various individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to the alleged manipulation of LIBOR and/or other benchmarks.\n\nThe majority of the USD LIBOR cases, which have been filed in various US jurisdictions, have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes in the US District Court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The complaints are substantially similar and allege, among other things, that Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. (BCI) and other financial institutions individually and collectively violated provisions of the US Sherman Antitrust Act (Antitrust Act), the US Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), the US Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and various state laws by manipulating USD LIBOR rates.\n\n## USD LIBOR civil actions\n\nPutative class actions and individual actions seek unspecified damages with the exception of three lawsuits, in which the plaintiffs are seeking a combined total of approximately $100m in actual damages and additional punitive damages against all defendants, including Barclays Bank PLC. Some of the lawsuits also seek trebling of damages under the Antitrust Act and RICO. Barclays Bank PLC has previously settled certain claims. Two class action settlements where Barclays Bank PLC has respectively paid $7.1m and $20m have received final court approval. Barclays Bank PLC also settled a further matter for $7.5m.\n\nIn 2016, two putative class actions filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other Sterling LIBOR panel banks alleging, among other things, that the defendants manipulated the Sterling LIBOR rate in violation of the Antitrust Act, CEA and RICO, were consolidated. The defendants' motion to dismiss the claims was granted in 2018. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\n## Sterling LIBOR civil actions\n\n## Japanese Yen LIBOR civil actions\n\nIn 2015, a second putative class action, making similar allegations to the above class action, was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in 2020. In 2021, the case was dismissed as against most defendants, including the Barclays entities. The plaintiffs and remaining defendants are seeking reconsideration of the decision.\n\nIn 2012, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by a lead plaintiff involved in exchange-traded derivatives and members of the Japanese Bankers Association's Euroyen Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (Euroyen TIBOR) panel. The complaint alleges, among other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of the CEA and the Antitrust Act. In 2014, the court dismissed the plaintiff's antitrust claims, and, in 2020, the court dismissed the plaintiff's remaining CEA claims.  The plaintiff has appealed the lower court's dismissal of such claims.\n\n## SIBOR/SOR civil action\n\nIn 2016, a putative class action was filed in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants, alleging manipulation of the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). In 2018, the court dismissed all claims against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI.  The plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal of their claims was granted in March 2021 and the matter has been remanded to the lower court for further proceedings. Defendants' petition for U.S. Supreme Court review was denied. Additionally, plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint, which defendants have moved to dismiss.",

        "page_content": "## 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued\n\n## ICE LIBOR civil actions\n\nIn August 2020, an ICE LIBOR-related action was filed by a group of individual plaintiffs in the US District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of individual borrowers and consumers of loans and credit cards with variable interest rates linked to USD ICE LIBOR. Plaintiffs' motions seeking, among other things, preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin the defendants from continuing to set LIBOR or enforce any financial instrument that relies in whole or in part on USD LIBOR were denied. The defendants have moved to dismiss the case.\n\nIn 2019, several putative class actions were filed in the SDNY against a panel of banks, including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, other financial institution defendants and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and certain of its affiliates (ICE), asserting antitrust claims that defendants manipulated USD LIBOR through defendants' submissions to ICE. These actions have been consolidated. The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted in 2020 and the plaintiffs appealed. In February 2022, the dismissal was affirmed on appeal.\n\n## Non-US benchmarks civil actions\n\n## Credit Default Swap civil action\n\nLegal proceedings (which include the claims referred to below in 'Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR') have been brought or threatened against Barclays Bank PLC (and, in certain cases, Barclays Bank UK PLC) and other banks in the UK in connection with alleged manipulation of LIBOR, EURIBOR and other benchmarks. Proceedings have also been brought in a number of other jurisdictions in Europe and Israel. Additional proceedings in other jurisdictions may be brought in the future.\n\nA putative antitrust class action is pending in New Mexico federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, and various other financial institutions. The plaintiffs, the New Mexico State Investment Council and certain New Mexico pension funds,  allege that the defendants conspired to manipulate the benchmark price used to value Credit Default Swap (CDS) contracts at settlement (i.e. the CDS final auction price).  The plaintiffs allege violations of  US antitrust laws and the CEA, and unjust enrichment under state law.\n\nIn 2015, the Group reached settlements totalling approximately $2.38bn with various US federal and state authorities and the FCA in relation to investigations into certain sales and trading practices in the Foreign Exchange market.\n\n## Foreign Exchange investigations and related civil actions\n\nThe European Commission announced two settlements in May 2019 and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately \u20ac210m. In June 2019, the Swiss Competition Commission announced two settlements and the Group paid penalties totalling approximately CHF27m.  In December 2021, the European Commission announced a final settlement which required the Group to pay penalties totalling approximately \u20ac54m, which amount has been provided for in previous periods. The financial impact of any ongoing matters is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## FX opt out civil action\n\nVarious individuals and corporates in a range of jurisdictions have threatened or brought civil actions against the Group and other banks in relation to alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets.\n\nIn 2018, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI settled a consolidated action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Foreign Exchange markets (Consolidated FX Action), for a total amount of $384m. Also in 2018, a group of plaintiffs who opted out of the Consolidated FX Action filed a complaint in the SDNY against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other defendants. Some of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed in 2020.\n\nIn 2015, a putative class action was filed against several international banks, including Barclays PLC and BCI, on behalf of a proposed class of individuals who exchanged currencies on a retail basis at bank branches (Retail Basis Claims). The SDNY has ruled that the Retail Basis Claims are not covered by the settlement agreement in the Consolidated FX Action. The Court subsequently dismissed all Retail Basis Claims against the Group and all other defendants. The plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint.\n\n## Retail basis civil action\n\n## Non-US FX civil actions\n\nThese include two purported class actions filed against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BX, BCI and other financial institutions in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal in 2019 following the settlements with the European Commission described above. Also in 2019, a separate claim was filed in the UK in the High Court of Justice (High Court), and subsequently transferred to the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal, by various banks and asset management firms against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions alleging breaches of European and UK competition laws related to FX trading.\n\nLegal proceedings have been brought or are threatened against Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and Barclays Execution Services Limited (BX) in connection with alleged manipulation of Foreign Exchange in the UK, a number of other jurisdictions in Europe, Israel, Brazil and Australia and additional proceedings may be brought in the future.",

The complaints allege that Barclays Bank PLC and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing Ltd. manipulated the prices of gold and gold derivative contracts in violation of the Antitrust Act and other federal laws. The parties have reached a joint settlement to resolve this matter for $50m, which is subject to court approval. The financial impact of Barclays' share of the joint settlement is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. A separate US civil complaint by a proposed class of plaintiffs against a number of banks, including Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and BX, alleging manipulation of the price of silver in violation of the CEA, the Antitrust Act and state antitrust and consumer protection laws, has been dismissed as against the Barclays entities. The plaintiffs have the option to seek the court's permission to appeal.\n\n## US residential mortgage related civil actions\n\nThese repurchase actions are ongoing. In one repurchase action, the New York Court of Appeals held that claims related to certain R&Ws are timebarred. Barclays Bank PLC has reached settlements to resolve two of the repurchase actions, subject to final court approval. Final court approval has been granted in relation to one of those matters and payment will be completed in the first quarter of 2022. The other matter is scheduled for a hearing in 2022 to seek approval for the settlement. The financial impact of the settlement is not expected to be material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position. The remaining two repurchase actions are pending.\n\nThere are various pending civil actions relating to US Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS), including four actions arising from unresolved repurchase requests submitted by Trustees for certain RMBS, alleging breaches of various loan-level representations and warranties (R&Ws) made by Barclays Bank PLC and/or a subsidiary acquired in 2007.  The unresolved repurchase requests had an original principal balance of approximately $2.1bn. The Trustees have also alleged that the relevant R&Ws may have been breached with respect to a greater (but unspecified) amount of loans than previously stated in the unresolved repurchase requests.\n\nIn 2020, a civil litigation claim was filed in the New Mexico First Judicial District Court by the State of New Mexico against six banks, including BCI, on behalf of two New Mexico state pension funds and the New Mexico State Investment Council relating to legacy RMBS purchases. As to BCI, the complaint alleges that the funds purchased approximately $22m in RMBS underwritten by BCI. The parties have reached a joint settlement to resolve this matter for $32.5m. The financial impact of BCI's share of the joint settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\nTreasury auction securities civil actions\n\n## Government and agency securities civil actions\n\nConsolidated putative class action complaints filed in US federal court against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI and other financial institutions under the Antitrust Act and state common law allege that the defendants (i) conspired to manipulate the US Treasury securities market and/or (ii) conspired to prevent the creation of certain platforms by boycotting or threatening to boycott such trading platforms. The court dismissed the consolidated action in March 2021. The plaintiffs have filed an amended complaint, which the defendants have moved to dismiss.\n\n## Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds civil actions\n\nIn addition, certain plaintiffs have filed a related, direct action against BCI and certain other financial institutions, alleging that defendants conspired to fix and manipulate the US Treasury securities market in violation of the Antitrust Act, the CEA and state common law.\n\nCivil antitrust actions have been filed in the SDNY and Federal Court of Canada in Toronto against Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, BX, Barclays Capital Securities Limited and, with respect to the civil action filed in Canada only, Barclays Capital Canada, Inc. and other financial institutions alleging that the defendants conspired to fix prices and restrain competition in the market for US dollar-denominated Supranational, Sovereign and Agency bonds.\n\n## Variable Rate Demand Obligations civil actions\n\nIn one of the actions filed in the SDNY, the court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' complaint. The dismissal was affirmed on appeal and this matter is now concluded. The plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the other SDNY action. In the Federal Court of Canada action, the plaintiffs reached settlements with a small number of banks in 2020 (not including Barclays Capital Canada Inc.), but the plaintiffs have not commenced the class certification process and the action remains at an early stage.\n\nCivil actions have been filed against Barclays Bank PLC and BCI and other financial institutions alleging the defendants conspired or colluded to artificially inflate interest rates set for Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs). VRDOs are municipal bonds with interest rates that reset on a periodic basis, most commonly weekly. Two actions in state court have been filed by private plaintiffs on behalf of the states of Illinois and California. Three putative class action complaints have been consolidated in the SDNY. In the consolidated SDNY class action, certain of the plaintiff's claims were dismissed in November 2020 and defendants' motion for partial dismissal of the amended consolidated complaint is pending. In the California action, the plaintiffs' claims were dismissed in June 2021. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\nIn a putative class action filed in the SDNY in 2019, plaintiffs alleged that BCI and certain other bond dealers conspired to fix the prices of US Government sponsored entity bonds in violation of US antitrust law. BCI agreed to a settlement of $87m, which received final court approval in 2020. Separately, various entities in Louisiana, including the Louisiana Attorney General and the City of Baton Rouge, commenced litigation against Barclays Bank PLC and other financial institutions making similar allegations as the SDNY class action plaintiffs. The parties have reached a settlement to resolve these matters. The financial impact of the settlement is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Government bond civil actions\n\nIn 2018, a separate putative class action against various financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, BCI, Barclays Bank Mexico, S.A., and certain other subsidiaries of the Group was consolidated in the SDNY. The plaintiffs asserted antitrust and state law claims arising out of an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of Mexican Government bonds. The Barclays entities have settled the claim for $5.7m, and the settlement has received final court approval.",

The complaint alleges a conspiracy to boycott developing electronic trading platforms for odd-lots and price fixing. Plaintiffs demand unspecified money damages. The defendants' motion to dismiss was granted in 2021. Plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.\n\nBarclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI, together with other financial institutions that act as market makers for interest rate swaps (IRS) are named as defendants in several antitrust class actions which were consolidated in the SDNY in 2016. The complaints allege the defendants conspired to prevent the development of exchanges for IRS and demand unspecified money damages.\n\n## BDC Finance L.L.C.\n\nIn 2018, trueEX LLC filed an antitrust class action in the SDNY against a number of financial institutions including Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and BCI based on similar allegations with respect to trueEX LLC's development of an IRS platform. In 2017, Tera Group Inc. filed a separate civil antitrust action in the SDNY claiming that certain conduct alleged in the IRS cases also caused the plaintiff to suffer harm with respect to the Credit Default Swaps market. In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the court dismissed certain claims in both cases for unjust enrichment and tortious interference but denied motions to dismiss the federal and state antitrust claims, which remain pending.\n\nIn 2008, BDC Finance L.L.C. (BDC) filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (NY Supreme Court), demanding damages of $298m, alleging that Barclays Bank PLC had breached a contract in connection with a portfolio of total return swaps governed by an ISDA Master Agreement (the Agreement). Following a trial, the court ruled in 2018 that Barclays Bank PLC was not a defaulting party, which was affirmed on appeal. In April 2021, the trial court entered judgement in favour of Barclays Bank PLC for $3.3m and as yet to be determined legal fees and costs. BDC appealed. In January 2022, the appellate court reversed the trial court's summary judgment decision in favour of Barclays Bank PLC and remanded the case to the lower court for further proceedings.\n\n## Civil actions in respect of the US Anti-Terrorism Act\n\nIn 2011, BDC's investment advisor, BDCM Fund Adviser, L.L.C. and its parent company, Black Diamond Capital Holdings, L.L.C. also sued Barclays Bank PLC and BCI in Connecticut State Court for unspecified damages allegedly resulting from Barclays Bank PLC's conduct relating to the Agreement, asserting claims for violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and tortious interference with business and prospective business relations. This case is currently stayed.\n\nThere are a number of civil actions, on behalf of more than 4,000 plaintiffs, filed in US federal courts in the US District Court in the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) and SDNY against Barclays Bank PLC and a number of other banks. The complaints generally allege that Barclays Bank PLC and those banks engaged in a conspiracy to facilitate US dollar-denominated transactions for the Iranian Government and various Iranian banks, which in turn funded acts of terrorism that injured or killed plaintiffs or plaintiffs' family members. The plaintiffs seek to recover damages for pain, suffering and mental anguish under the provisions of the US Anti-Terrorism Act, which allow for the trebling of any proven damages.\n\n## Shareholder derivative action\n\nThe court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss three out of the six actions in the EDNY. Plaintiffs have appealed in one action. The remaining actions are stayed pending a decision on the appeal. Out of the two actions in the SDNY, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the first action, which is stayed pending a decision on the EDNY appeal. The second SDNY action is stayed, pending any appeal on the dismissal of the first.\n\nIn November 2020, a purported Barclays shareholder filed a putative derivative action in New York state court against BCI and a number of current and former members of the Board of Directors of Barclays PLC and senior executives or employees of the Group. The shareholder filed the claim on behalf of nominal defendant Barclays PLC, alleging that the individual defendants harmed the company through breaches of their duties, including under the Companies Act 2006. The plaintiff seeks damages on behalf of Barclays PLC for the losses that Barclays PLC allegedly suffered as a result of these alleged breaches. An amended complaint was filed in April 2021, which BCI and certain other defendants have moved to dismiss.\n\nIn 2021, Vestia (a Dutch housing association) brought a claim against Barclays Bank PLC in the UK in the High Court in relation to a series of derivative transactions entered into with Barclays Bank PLC between 2008 and 2011, seeking damages of \u00a3329m. Barclays Bank PLC is defending the claim and has made a counterclaim.\n\n## Derivative transactions civil action\n\n## Timeshare loans, skilled person review, and associated matters\n\nIn August 2020, the FCA granted an application by Clydesdale Financial Services Limited (CFS), which trades as Barclays Partner Finance and houses Barclays' point-of-sale finance business, for a validation order with respect to certain loans to customers brokered between April 2014 and April 2016 by Azure Services Limited (ASL), a timeshare operator, which did not, at the point of sale, hold the necessary broker licence.  As a condition to the validation order, the FCA required CFS to undertake a skilled person review of the assessment of affordability processes for the loans brokered by ASL (ASL Loans) as well as CFS' policies and procedures for assessing affordability and oversight of brokers more generally, and dictated a remediation methodology in the event that ASL Loans did not pass the affordability test. CFS has voluntarily agreed to remediate the ASL Loans, which is expected to amount to \u00a337.4m, in accordance with the FCA's methodology and the remediation exercise is at an advanced stage. The remaining scope of the skilled person review is complete. The skilled person made a number of observations, some of which were adverse, about both current and historic affordability practices as well as current oversight practices.  CFS is not required to conduct a full back book review but, subject to agreement with the FCA, will be reviewing discrete cohorts of loans to determine whether historic affordability and/or broker oversight practices may have caused customer harm.  Where harm is identified, CFS' intention is to remediate.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nAccruals, provisions, contingent liabilities and legal proceedings continued\n\n## 26 Legal, competition and regulatory matters continued\n\nFollowing on from the skilled person review, there is ongoing dialogue with the FCA regarding other loans brokered by ASL and entered into outside the April 2014 to April 2016 period. Separately there is ongoing dialogue with the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) regarding a number of other complaints involving timeshare loans.\n\n## 2. Barclays PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC\n\nIt is not currently possible to predict the outcome of this dialogue with the FCA or the FOS or the financial impact on the Group.\n\n## Investigation into UK cards' affordability\n\n## HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) assessments concerning UK Value Added Tax\n\nThe FCA has been investigating certain aspects of the affordability assessment processes used by Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Bank PLC for credit card applications made to Barclays' UK credit card business. In October 2021, the FCA confirmed that this investigation was closed with no further action.\n\nIn 2018, HMRC issued notices that have the effect of removing certain overseas subsidiaries that have operations in the UK from Barclays' UK VAT group, in which group supplies between members are generally free from VAT. The notices have retrospective effect and correspond to assessments of \u00a3181m (inclusive of interest), of which Barclays would expect to attribute an amount of approximately \u00a3128m to Barclays Bank UK PLC and \u00a353m to Barclays Bank PLC. HMRC's decision has been appealed to the First Tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber).\n\nFollowing settlement by Barclays Bank PLC of various governmental investigations concerning certain benchmark interest rate submissions referred to above in 'Investigations into LIBOR and other benchmarks and related civil actions', in the UK, certain local authorities brought claims in 2018 against Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC asserting that they entered into loans between 2006 and 2008 in reliance on misrepresentations made by Barclays Bank PLC in respect of its conduct in relation to LIBOR. Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC were successful in their applications to strike out the claims. The claims have been settled on terms such that the parties have agreed not to pursue these claims further and to bear their own costs. The financial impact of the settlements is not material to the Group's operating results, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Local authority civil actions concerning LIBOR\n\n## 3. Barclays PLC\n\nIn 2020, a claim was brought against Barclays PLC in the UK in the High Court by various shareholders regarding Barclays PLC's share price based on the allegations contained within a complaint by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) in 2014. Such claim was settled in 2016, as previously disclosed. The more recent claim seeks unquantified damages. The NYAG complaint was filed against Barclays PLC and BCI in the NY Supreme Court alleging, among other things, that Barclays PLC and BCI engaged in fraud and deceptive practices in connection with LX, BCI's SEC-registered alternative trading system.\n\n## Alternative trading systems\n\n## General\n\nThe Group is also subject to enquiries and examinations, requests for information, audits, investigations and legal and other proceedings by regulators, governmental and other public bodies in connection with (but not limited to) consumer protection measures, compliance with legislation and regulation, wholesale trading activity and other areas of banking and business activities in which the Group is or has been engaged. The Group is cooperating with the relevant authorities and keeping all relevant agencies briefed as appropriate in relation to these matters and others described in this note on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group is engaged in various other legal, competition and regulatory matters in the UK, the US and a number of other overseas jurisdictions. It is subject to legal proceedings brought by and against the Group which arise in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including (but not limited to) disputes in relation to contracts, securities, debt collection, consumer credit, fraud, trusts, client assets, competition, data management and protection, intellectual property, money laundering, financial crime, employment, environmental and other statutory and common law issues.\n\nAt the present time, Barclays PLC does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these other matters to have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial position. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters and the matters specifically described in this note, there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters (including formerly active matters or those matters arising after the date of this note) will not be material to Barclays PLC's results, operations or cash flow for a particular period, depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the amount of profit otherwise reported for the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nCapital instruments, equity and reserves continued\n\n## 27 Subordinated liabilities continued\n\n## Undated subordinated liabilities\n\n## Subordination\n\nThe undated subordinated liabilities that are issued by Barclays Bank PLC and its subsidiaries are for the development and expansion of the businesses and to strengthen the capital bases. The principal terms of such undated subordinated liabilities are described below:\n\nAll undated subordinated liabilities rank behind the claims against Barclays Bank PLC of depositors and other unsecured unsubordinated creditors and holders of dated subordinated liabilities in the following order: Junior Undated Floating Rate Notes; followed by TONs and RCIs ranking pari passu with each other.\n\nThe Junior Undated Notes are floating rate notes where rates are fixed periodically in advance based on the related market rate.\n\n## Interest\n\nThe TONs and RCIs bear a fixed rate of interest until the initial call date. After the initial call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the TONs and RCIs will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nNo payment of principal or any interest may be made in relation to the TONs and RCIs unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test.\n\n## Payment of interest\n\nBarclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the RCIs. Any such deferred payment of interest must be paid on the earlier of: (i) the date of redemption of the RCIs, and (ii) the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the tenth anniversary of the date of deferral of such payment. Whilst such deferral is continuing, (i) neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares or preference shares and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.\n\n## Repayment\n\nBarclays Bank PLC may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in noncompliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the PRA. Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a redemption of the TONs. Until such time as Barclays Bank PLC next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, (i) neither Barclays Bank PLC nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or preference shares, or make payments of interest in respect of Barclays Bank PLC's Reserve Capital Instruments and (ii) certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.\n\nAll undated subordinated liabilities are repayable at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, generally in whole, at the initial call date and on any subsequent coupon or interest payment date. In addition, each issue of undated subordinated liabilities is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments require the prior consent of the PRA.\n\nAll issues of undated subordinated liabilities are non-convertible.\n\n## Other\n\n## Undated Subordinated Loan Notes (secured)\n\nThe Undated Subordinated Loan Notes (secured) are direct, secured, subordinated and limited recourse obligations of the SPV issuer issued in connection with a securitisation of assets originated by a subsidiary of Barclays PLC. Payments of principal and interest are subject to the relevant priority of payments for the securitisation.  The security is held on trust for the holders of such loan notes and the other secured creditors to the securitisation and any proceeds from the enforcement of such security shall be applied in accordance with the post enforcement priority of payments.  Such loan notes have interest calculated periodically based on overnight market interest rates for Sterling and will mature on the first interest payment date following the date which is 12 months after the contractual maturity date of the longest dated remaining eligible receivable at the end of the revolving period for asset additions.  Such loan notes may be accelerated upon the SPV issuer's non-payment, breach of other obligations, material misrepresentation, insolvency, repudiation or change of control or it becomes unlawful for the SPV issuer to perform its obligations. The loans notes are non-convertible.",

In addition, the AT1 securities are redeemable, at the option of Barclays PLC, in whole in the event of certain changes in the tax or regulatory treatment of the securities. Any redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA.\n- \u25a0 AT1 securities rank behind the claims against Barclays PLC of 1) unsubordinated creditors; 2) claims which are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Barclays PLC but not further or otherwise; or 3) claims which are, or are expressed to be, junior to the claims of other creditors of Barclays PLC, whether subordinated or unsubordinated, other than claims which rank, or are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or junior to, the claims of holders of the AT1 securities.\n- \u25a0 AT1 securities bear a fixed rate of interest until the initial reset date. After the initial reset date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the AT1 securities will bear interest at rates fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates.\n\nAll AT1 securities will be converted into ordinary shares of Barclays PLC, at a pre-determined price, should the fully loaded CET1 ratio of the Group fall below 7%.\n\n- \u25a0 Interest on the AT1 securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of Barclays PLC, and Barclays PLC has sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.\n\n## 29 Reserves\n\nThe currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Group's net investment in foreign operations, net of the effects of hedging.\n\n## Currency translation reserve\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve\n\n## Cash flow hedging reserve\n\nThe fair value through other comprehensive income reserve represents the changes in the fair value of fair value through other comprehensive income investments since initial recognition.\n\nThe cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to profit or loss when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.\n\nThe own credit reserve reflects the cumulative own credit gains and losses on financial liabilities at fair value. Amounts in the own credit reserve are not recycled to profit or loss in future periods.\n\n## Own credit reserve\n\n## Other reserves and treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares relate to Barclays PLC shares held in relation to the Group's various share schemes. These schemes are described in Note 32. Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders' equity within other reserves.

These are non-controlling interests to the Group.\n\n## Barclays Bank PLC and protective rights of non-controlling interests\n\nA fixed coupon rate is attached to all Upper Tier 2 instruments until the initial call date, with the exception of the 9% Bonds, which are fixed for the life of the issue and the Series 1, Series 2 and Series 3 Undated Notes, which are floating rate at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nThe payment of preference share dividends and Upper Tier 2 coupons are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC, except for coupon payments that become compulsory where Barclays PLC has declared or paid a dividend on ordinary shares, or in certain cases, any class of preference shares, in the preceding six-month period.  Coupons not paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances. No dividend or coupon payments may be made unless Barclays Bank PLC satisfies a specified solvency test. Under the terms of these instruments, Barclays PLC may not pay dividends on ordinary shares until a dividend or coupon is next paid on these instruments or the instruments are redeemed or purchased by Barclays Bank PLC. There are no restrictions on Barclays Bank PLC's ability to remit capital to the Parent as a result of these issued instruments.\n\nAfter the initial call date, in the event they are not redeemed, coupon payments in relation to the  6.125% Undated Notes are fixed periodically in advance for five-year periods based on market rates. Coupon payments for all other Upper Tier 2 instruments are at rates fixed periodically in advance based on market rates.\n\nPreference share redemptions are typically at the discretion of Barclays Bank PLC. Upper Tier 2 instruments are repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC generally in whole at the initial call date and on any subsequent coupon payment date or, in the case of the 6.125% Undated Notes on any fifth anniversary after the initial call date. In addition, each issue of Upper Tier 2 instruments is repayable, at the option of Barclays Bank PLC, in whole for certain tax reasons, either at any time, or on an interest payment date. There are no events of default except non-payment of principal or mandatory interest. Any repayments or redemptions require the prior consent of the PRA, and in respect of the preference shares, any such redemption will be subject to the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Barclays Bank PLC.\n\n|                                                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Instrument                                                     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n| Preference Shares:                                             |        |        |\n| US Dollar Preference Shares                                    | 318    | 318    |\n| Euro Preference Shares                                         | 211    | 211    |\n| Total Barclays Bank PLC Preference Shares                      | 529    | 529    |\n| Upper Tier 2 Instruments:                                      |        |        |\n| Undated Floating Rate Primary Capital Notes Series 1           | 93     | 93     |\n| Undated Floating Rate Primary Capital Notes Series 2           | 179    | 179    |\n| 5.03% Undated Reverse Dual Currency Subordinated Loan (JPY8bn) | 39     | 39     |\n| 5.0% Reverse Dual Currency Undated Subordinated Loan (JPY12bn) | 53     | 53     |\n| Undated Floating Rate Primary Capital Notes Series 3 (\u00a3145m)   | 20     | 20     |\n| 9% Permanent Interest Bearing Capital Bonds (\u00a3100m)            | 40     | 40     |\n| 6.125% Undated Subordinated Notes (\u00a3550m)                      | 34     | 34     |\n| 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds (ex Woolwich) (\u00a3150m)       | -      | 75     |\n| Total Upper Tier 2 Instruments                                 | 458    | 533    |",

To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period. The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share awards is recognised is based upon the period employees consider their services contribute to the awards. For past awards, the Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest. In relation to awards granted from 2017, the Group, taking into account the changing employee understanding surrounding those awards, considered it appropriate for expense to be recognised over the vesting period including the financial year prior to the grant date.\n\n|                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Incentive awards granted:                                                      |           |           |           |\n| Current year bonus                                                             | 1,278     | 1,090     | 1,058     |\n| Deferred bonus                                                                 | 667       | 490       | 432       |\n| Total incentive awards granted                                                 | 1,945     | 1,580     | 1,490     |\n| Reconciliation of incentive awards granted to income statement charge:         |           |           |           |\n| Less: deferred bonuses granted but not charged in current year                 | (457)     | (335)     | (293)     |\n| Add: current year charges for deferred bonuses from previous years             | 280       | 293       | 308       |\n| Other differences between incentive awards granted and income statement charge | (23)      | (34)      | (48)      |\n| Income statement charge for performance costs                                  | 1,745     | 1,504     | 1,457     |\n| Other income statement charges:                                                |           |           |           |\n| Salaries                                                                       | 4,290     | 4,322     | 4,332     |\n| Social security costs                                                          | 619       | 613       | 573       |\n| Post-retirement benefits a                                                     | 539       | 519       | 501       |\n| Other compensation costs                                                       | 431       | 479       | 480       |\n| Total compensation costs b                                                     | 7,624     | 7,437     | 7,343     |\n| Other resourcing costs:                                                        |           |           |           |\n| Outsourcing                                                                    | 357       | 342       | 433       |\n| Redundancy and restructuring                                                   | 296       | 102       | 132       |\n| Temporary staff costs                                                          | 109       | 102       | 256       |\n| Other                                                                          | 125       | 114       | 151       |\n| Total other resourcing costs                                                   | 887       | 660       | 972       |\n| Total staff costs                                                              | 8,511     | 8,097     | 8,315     |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  \u00a3484m (2020: \u00a3451m; 2019: \u00a3439m) of Group compensation was capitalised as internally generated software and  excluded from the Staff cost disclosed above .\n- a Post-retirement benefits charge includes \u00a3289m (2020: \u00a3279m; 2019: \u00a3270m) in respect of defined contribution schemes and \u00a3250m (2020: \u00a3240m; 2019: \u00a3231m) in respect of defined benefit schemes.",

The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services. The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.\n\nThe number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met. Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.\n\nThe charge for the year arising from share-based payment schemes was as follows:\n\nThe fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability. The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest. These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors. Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions - such as continuing to make payments into a share-based savings scheme.\n\n|                                                | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   | Charge for the year   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                | 2021 \u00a3m               | 2020 \u00a3m               | 2019 \u00a3m               |\n| Deferred Share Value Plan and Share Value Plan | 256                   | 245                   | 272                   |\n| Others                                         | 216                   | 184                   | 206                   |\n| Total equity settled                           | 472                   | 429                   | 478                   |\n| Cash settled                                   | 5                     | 2                     | 3                     |\n| Total share-based payments                     | 477                   | 431                   | 481                   |\n\nThe terms of the main current plans are as follows:\n\nThe SVP was introduced in March 2010. SVP awards have been granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three, five or seven years. Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares. For awards granted before December 2017, the grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award. SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes. All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.\n\n## Share Value Plan (SVP)\n\n## Deferred Share Value Plan (DSVP)\n\n## Other schemes\n\nThe DSVP was introduced in February 2017. The terms of the DSVP are materially the same as the terms of the SVP as described above, save that Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the DSVP and the DSVP operates over market purchase shares only.\n\nIn addition to the SVP and DSVP, the Barclays Group operates a number of other schemes settled in Barclays PLC Shares including Sharesave (both UK and Ireland), Sharepurchase (both UK and overseas), and the Barclays Group Long Term Incentive Plan. A delivery of upfront shares to 'Material Risk Takers' can be made as a Share Incentive Award (Holding Period).\n\nThe weighted average fair value per award granted, weighted average share price at the date of exercise/release of shares during the year, weighted average contractual remaining life and number of options and awards outstanding (including those exercisable) at the balance sheet date were as follows:\n\n## Share option and award plans\n\n|                  | 2021                                                      | 2021                                                              | 2021                                            | 2021                                     | 2020                                                      | 2020                                                              | 2020                                            | 2020                                     |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Weighted  average fair  value per  award granted  in year | Weighted  average share  price at  exercise/ release during  year | Weighted  average  remaining  contractual  life | Number of  options/  awards  outstanding | Weighted  average fair  value per  award granted  in year | Weighted  average share  price at  exercise/ release during  year | Weighted  average  remaining  contractual  life | Number of  options/  awards  outstanding |\n|                  | \u00a3                                                         | \u00a3                                                                 | in years                                        | (000s)                                   | \u00a3                                                         | \u00a3                                                                 | in years                                        | (000s)                                   |\n| DSVP and SVP a,b | 1.62                                                      | 1.76                                                              | 1                                               | 413,859                                  | 1.06                                                      | 1.24                                                              | 1                                               | 416,941                                  |\n| Others a         | 0.64-1.80                                                 | 1.75-1.92                                                         | 0-3                                             | 335,976                                  | 0.23-1.24                                                 | 1.04-1.68                                                         | 0-3                                             | 356,033                                  |\n\n## Notes\n\n- b  Weighted average exercise price is not applicable for SVP and DSVP awards as these are not share option schemes.\n- a Options/award granted over Barclays PLC shares.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Awards granted under the DSVP may be satisfied using market purchase shares only.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the total liability arising from cash-settled share-based payments transactions was \u00a35m (2020: \u00a32m).\n\nVarious employee benefit trusts established by the Group hold shares in Barclays PLC to meet obligations under the Barclays share-based payment schemes. The total number of Barclays shares held in these employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2021 was 12.9m (2020: 17.1m). Dividend rights have been waived on all these shares. The total market value of the shares held in trust based on the year end share price of \u00a31.87 (2020: \u00a31.27) was \u00a324m (2020: \u00a322m). For accounting of treasury shares, see Note 29.\n\n## Holdings of Barclays PLC shares and hedges\n\nThe Group has entered into physically settled forward contracts to hedge the settlement of certain share-based payment schemes.

Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes and post-employment benefit schemes.\n\nDefined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligations to members of each scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets after applying the asset ceiling test.\n\nChanges in pension scheme liabilities or assets (remeasurements) that do not arise from regular pension cost, net interest on net defined benefit\n\nEach scheme's obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method. Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.\n\nliabilities or assets, past service costs, settlements or contributions to the scheme, are recognised in other comprehensive income. Remeasurements comprise experience adjustments (differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred), the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in the interest on the assets) and any changes in the effect of the asset ceiling restriction (excluding amounts included in the interest on the restriction).\n\nPost-employment benefit schemes the cost of providing healthcare benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.\n\n## Pension schemes\n\nThe UKRF is the Group's main scheme, representing 97% of the Group's total retirement benefit obligations. Barclays Bank PLC is the principal employer of the UKRF. The UKRF was closed to new entrants on 1 October 2012, and comprises 10 sections, the two most significant of which are:\n\n## UK Retirement Fund (UKRF)\n\n- \u25a0 Afterwork, which comprises a contributory cash balance defined benefit element, and a voluntary defined contribution element. The cash balance element is accrued each year and revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index (RPI) (up to a maximum of 5% p.a.). An increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays' discretion. The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits for Afterwork members are borne by the UKRF. The main risks that Barclays runs in relation to Afterwork are limited although additional contributions are required if pre-retirement investment returns are not sufficient to provide for the benefits.\n\n## Barclays Pension Savings Plan (BPSP)\n\n- \u25a0 The 1964 Pension Scheme. Most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010. Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary. From 1 April 2010, members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or the Pension Investment Plan, a historic defined contribution section which is now closed to future contributions. The risks that Barclays runs in relation to the 1964 section are typical of final salary pension schemes, principally that investment returns fall short of expectations, that inflation exceeds expectations, and that retirees live longer than expected.\n\nThe BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK hires from 1 October 2012, BPSP is not subject to the same investment return, inflation or life expectancy risks for Barclays that defined benefit schemes are. Members' benefits reflect contributions paid and the level of investment returns achieved.\n\nApart from the UKRF and the BPSP, Barclays operates a number of smaller pension and long-term employee benefits and post-retirement healthcare plans globally, the largest of which are the US defined benefit and defined contribution schemes. Many of the schemes are funded, with assets backing the obligations held in separate legal vehicles such as trusts. Others are operated on an unfunded basis. The benefits provided, the approach to funding, and the legal basis of the schemes, reflect local environments.\n\n## Other\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays (and who are not members of the UKRF), plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff, deferred and pensioner members who apply for the role.\n\nThe UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation. The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC. The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.\n\nThe BPSP is a Group Personal Pension arrangement which operates as a collection of personal pension plans. Each personal pension plan is a direct contract between the employee and the BPSP provider (Legal & General Assurance Society Limited), and is regulated by the FCA.\n\nSimilar principles of pension governance apply to the Group's other pension schemes, depending on local legislation.",

The UKRF expected benefits are projected to be paid out for in excess of 50 years, although 25% of the total benefits are expected to be paid in the next 10 years; 30% in years 11 to 20 and 25% in years 20 to 30. The remainder of the benefits are expected to be paid beyond 30 years.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the UKRF's scheme assets were in surplus versus IAS 19 obligations by \u00a33,819m (2020: \u00a31,807m). The movement for the UKRF was driven by \u00a3700m of deficit reduction contributions, higher corporate bond yields and favourable asset returns, partially offset by higher expected long term price inflation.\n\nOf the \u00a31,268m (2020: \u00a31,370m) UKRF benefits paid out, \u00a3419m (2020: \u00a3520m) related to transfers out of the fund.\n\nWhere a scheme's assets exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions (the asset ceiling). In the case of the UKRF the asset ceiling is not applied as, in certain specified circumstances such as wind-up, the Group expects to be able to recover any surplus. Similarly, a liability in respect of future minimum funding requirements is not recognised. The Trustee does not have a substantive right to augment benefits, nor do they have the right to wind up the plan except in the dissolution of the Group or termination of contributions by the Group. The application of the asset ceiling to other plans and recognition of additional liabilities in respect of future minimum funding requirements are considered on an individual plan basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for the UKRF.\n\n|                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Key UKRF financial assumptions | % p.a. | % p.a. |\n| Discount rate                  | 1.84   | 1.29   |\n| Inflation rate (RPI)           | 3.56   | 2.99   |\n\nThe UKRF discount rate assumption for 2021 was based on a standard Willis Towers Watson RATE Link model. The RPI inflation assumption for 2021 was set by reference to the Bank of England's implied inflation curve. The inflation assumption incorporates a deduction of 20 basis points as an allowance for an inflation risk premium. The methodology used to derive the discount rate and inflation assumptions is consistent with that used at the prior year end.\n\nThe UKRF's post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2019 of the UKRF's own post-retirement mortality experience, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys. An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the 2020 core projection model published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a long-term trend of 1.5% per annum in future improvements. The methodology used is consistent with the prior year end, except that the 2019 core projection model was used at 2020. The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the past three years:\n\n| Assumed life expectancy                                               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners (years)                  |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 27.3   | 27.2   | 27.1   |\n| - Females                                                             | 29.6   | 29.4   | 29.3   |\n| Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 (years) |        |        |        |\n| - Males                                                               | 29.1   | 29.0   | 28.9   |\n| - Females                                                             | 31.4   | 31.2   | 31.1   |\n\nThe UKRF entered into a \u00a35bn longevity swap in 2020 covering around a quarter of the pensioner liabilities. The swap is part of the UKRF's investment portfolio and provide income in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The swap is not included directly within the balance sheet of Barclays PLC as it is an asset of the UKRF. At 31 December 2021, the swap is valued at nil (2020:nil) as experience since the swap was effected has been neutral.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been calculated by valuing the UKRF liabilities using the amended assumptions shown in the table below and keeping the remaining assumptions the same as disclosed in the table above, except in the case of the inflation sensitivity where other assumptions that depend on assumed inflation have also been amended correspondingly. The difference between the recalculated liability figure and that stated in the balance sheet reconciliation table above is the figure shown. The selection of these movements to illustrate the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to key assumptions should not be interpreted as Barclays expressing any specific view of the probability of such movements happening.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions\n\nChange in key assumptions\n\n|                       | 2021 (Decrease)/  Increase in UKRF  defined benefit  obligation \u00a3bn   | 2020 (Decrease)/  Increase in UKRF  defined benefit  obligation \u00a3bn   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Discount rate         |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| 0.5% p.a. increase    | (2.3)                                                                 | (2.5)                                                                 |\n| 0.25% p.a. increase   | (1.2)                                                                 | (1.3)                                                                 |\n| 0.25% p.a. decrease   | 1.3                                                                   | 1.4                                                                   |\n| 0.5% p.a. decrease    | 2.6                                                                   | 2.9                                                                   |\n| Assumed RPI           |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| 0.5% p.a. increase    | 1.6                                                                   | 1.8                                                                   |\n| 0.25% p.a. increase   | 0.8                                                                   | 0.9                                                                   |\n| 0.25% p.a. decrease   | (0.8)                                                                 | (0.9)                                                                 |\n| 0.5% p.a. decrease    | (1.6)                                                                 | (1.8)                                                                 |\n| Life expectancy at 60 |                                                                       |                                                                       |\n| One year increase     | 1.2                                                                   | 1.2                                                                   |\n| One year decrease     | (1.2)                                                                 | (1.2)                                                                 |",

The value of assets shown reflects the assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reflected on a fair value basis.\n\nA long-term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets. This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long-term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others. The long-term investment strategy ensures, among other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.\n\nThe value of the assets of the schemes and their percentage in relation to total scheme assets were as follows:\n\n|                                 | Total       | Total         | Total     | Total                                         | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF   | Of which relates to UKRF                      |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | Quoted a \u00a3m | Unquoted a \u00a3m | Value  \u00a3m | % of total fair  value of   scheme  assets  % | Quoted a \u00a3m                | Unquoted a \u00a3m              | Value  \u00a3m                  | % of total fair  value of   scheme  assets  % |\n| As at 31 December 2021          |             |               |           |                                               |                            |                            |                            |                                               |\n| Equities                        | 214         | 1,377         | 1,591     | 4.5                                           | 86                         | 1,377                      | 1,463                      | 4.2                                           |\n| Private equities                | -

Valuations of complex instruments are based on UKRF custodian valuations. All valuations are determined in accordance with relevant industry guidance.\n\nIncluded within the fair value of scheme assets were nil (2020: nil) relating to shares in Barclays PLC and nil (2020: nil) relating to bonds issued by Barclays PLC. The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by Barclays PLC.\n\nApproximately 45% of the UKRF assets are invested in liability-driven investment strategies; primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps. These are used to better match the assets to its liabilities. The swaps are used to reduce the scheme's inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.\n\nThe UKRF assets above do not include the Senior Notes asset referred to in the section below on Triennial Valuation, as these are non-transferable instruments and not recognised under IAS 19.\n\n## Triennial valuation\n\nThe main differences between the funding and accounting assumptions are a different approach to setting the discount rate and a more conservative longevity assumption for funding.\n\nThe latest annual update as at 30 September 2021 showed the funding position had improved to a surplus of \u00a30.6bn from a deficit of \u00a30.9bn shown at 30 September 2020. The improvement was mainly due to \u00a30.7bn of deficit reduction contributions and favourable asset returns, partially offset by higher expected long term price inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These Senior Notes entitle the UKRF to semi-annual coupon payments for five years, and full repayment in cash in three tranches: \u00a3250m in 2023, \u00a3750m in 2024, and \u00a3250m at final maturity in 2025. The regulatory capital impact, which otherwise would have occurred in 2019 and 2020 from the regular deficit reduction contributions, takes effect in 2023, 2024 and 2025 on maturity of the notes. As the UKRF's investment in these Senior Notes does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS 19, the \u00a31,250m does not appear in the IAS 19 plan assets. The Senior Notes were issued by Heron Issuer Limited (Heron) for \u00a3500m and Heron Issuer Number 2 Limited (Heron 2) for \u00a3750m, entities consolidated within the Group under IFRS 10. Heron and Heron 2 acquired a total of \u00a31,250m of gilts from Barclays Bank PLC for cash to support payments on the Senior Notes. There were no further transactions of this type in 2021.\n\n## Other support measures agreed which remain in place\n\nThe deficit reduction contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Group's share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year. The next funding valuation of the UKRF is due to be completed in 2023 with an effective date of 30 September 2022.\n\nCollateral - The UKRF Trustee and Barclays Bank PLC have entered into an arrangement whereby a collateral pool has been put in place to provide security for the UKRF funding deficit as it increases or decreases over time. The collateral pool is currently made up of government securities, and agreement was made with the Trustee to cover at least 100% of the funding deficit with an overall cap of \u00a39bn. The arrangement provides the UKRF Trustee with dedicated access to the pool of assets in the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution to the UKRF or in the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency. These assets are included within Note 38 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred.\n\nParticipation - As permitted under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Banking Reform) (Pensions) Regulations 2016, Barclays Bank UK PLC is a participating employer in the UKRF and will remain so during a transitional phase until September 2025 as set out in a deed of participation. Barclays Bank UK PLC will make contributions for the future service of its employees who are currently Afterwork members and, in the event of Barclays Bank PLC's insolvency during this period provision has been made to require Barclays Bank UK PLC to become the principal employer of the UKRF. Barclays Bank PLC's Section 75 debt would be triggered by the insolvency (the debt would be calculated after allowing for the payment to the UKRF of the collateral above).\n\nSupport from Barclays PLC - In the event of Barclays Bank PLC not paying a deficit reduction contribution payment required by a specified pre-payment date, Barclays PLC has entered into an arrangement whereby it will be required to use, in first priority, dividends received from Barclays Bank UK PLC (if any) to invest the proceeds in Barclays Bank PLC (up to the maximum amount of the deficit reduction contribution unpaid by Barclays Bank PLC). The proceeds of the investment will be used to discharge Barclays Bank PLC's unpaid deficit reduction contribution.\n\nDefined benefit contributions paid with respect to the UKRF were as follows:\n\n|      | Contributions paid   |\n|------|----------------------|\n|      | \u00a3m                   |\n| 2021 | 955                  |\n| 2020 | 748                  |\n| 2019 | 1,231                |\n\nThere were nil (2020: nil; 2019: nil) Section 75 contributions included within the Group's contributions paid as no participating employers left the UKRF in 2021.\n\nThe Group's expected contribution to the UKRF in respect of defined benefits in 2022 is \u00a3546m (2021: \u00a3959m). In addition, the expected contributions to UK defined contribution schemes in 2022 is \u00a333m (2021: \u00a335m) to the UKRF and \u00a3221m (2021: \u00a3209m) to the BPSP.",

Detail is also given on securitisation transactions the Group has entered into and arrangements that are held off-balance sheet.\n\n## 34 Principal subsidiaries\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of the Group and all its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has control. Under IFRS 10, this is when the Group is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nIntra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there have been changes to its power, its rights to variable returns or its ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns.\n\nThe significant judgements used in applying this policy are set out below.\n\nIn the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment.\n\n## Accounting for investment in subsidiaries\n\nPrincipal subsidiaries for the Group are set out below. This includes those subsidiaries that are most significant in the context of the Group's business, results or financial position.\n\n| Company name                        | Principal place of   business or incorporation   | Nature of business       |   Percentage of voting  rights held % | Non-controlling  interests  - proportion of  ownership interests   | Non-controlling  interests  - proportion of  voting interests   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Barclays Bank PLC                   | United Kingdom                                   | Banking, holding company |                                   100 | % 2                                                                | % -                                                             |\n| Barclays Bank UK PLC                | United Kingdom                                   | Banking, holding company |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays Bank Ireland PLC           | Ireland                                          | Banking                  |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays Execution Services Limited | United Kingdom                                   | Service company          |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays Capital Inc.               | United States                                    | Securities dealing       |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays Capital Securities Limited | United Kingdom                                   | Securities dealing       |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays Securities Japan Limited   | Japan                                            | Securities dealing       |                                   100 | -                                                                  | -                                                               |\n| Barclays US LLC                     | United States                                    | Holding company          |                                   100 | -                                                                  |                                                                 |\n| Barclays Bank Delaware              | United States                                    | Credit card issuer       |                                   100 | -                                                                  | - -                                                             |\n\nThe country of registration or incorporation is also the principal area of operation of each of the above subsidiaries.\n\nDetermining whether the Group has control of an entity is generally straightforward based on ownership of the majority of the voting capital. However, in certain instances, this determination will involve judgement, particularly in the case of structured entities where voting rights are often not the determining factor in decisions over the relevant activities. This judgement will involve assessing the purpose and design of the entity. It will also often be necessary to consider whether the Group, or another involved party with power over the relevant activities, is acting as a principal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others.\n\nOwnership interests are in some cases different to voting interests due to the existence of non-voting equity interests, such as preference shares. Refer to Note 30 for more information.\n\nThere is also often considerable judgement involved in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entities. In this regard, where market conditions have deteriorated such that the other investors' exposures to the structure's variable returns have been substantively eliminated, the Group may conclude that the managers of the structured entity are acting as its agent and therefore will consolidate the structured entity.\n\nAn interest in equity voting rights exceeding 50% would typically indicate that the Group has control of an entity. However, the entity set out below is excluded from consolidation because the Group does not have exposure to its variable returns.\n\n|                  |                                          | Percentage of voting  rights held   | Equity shareholders'  funds   | Retained profit for  the year   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Company name     | Country of registration or incorporation | %                                   | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m                              |\n| Palomino Limited | Cayman Islands                           | 100                                 | -                             | -                               |\n\nThis entity is managed by an external counterparty and consequently is not controlled by the Group.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Scope of consolidation continued\n\n## 34 Principal subsidiaries continued\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nAs is typical for a group of its size and international scope, there are restrictions on the ability of Barclays PLC to obtain distributions of capital, access the assets or repay the liabilities of members of its Group due to the statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements of its subsidiaries and due to the protective rights of non-controlling interests. These are considered below.\n\nBarclays' principal subsidiary companies have assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of \u00a31,833bn (2020: \u00a31,795bn) and \u00a31,737bn (2020: \u00a31,703bn) respectively. Certain of these assets and liabilities are subject to prudential regulation and regulatory capital requirements in the countries in which they are regulated. These require entities to maintain minimum capital levels which cannot be returned to the parent company, Barclays PLC, on a going concern basis.\n\n## Liquidity requirements\n\nIn order to meet capital requirements, subsidiaries may issue certain equity-accounted and debt-accounted financial instruments and non-equity instruments such as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments and other forms of subordinated liabilities. Refer to Note 27 and Note 28 for particulars of these instruments. These instruments may be subject to cancellation clauses or preference share restrictions that would limit the ability of the entity to repatriate the capital on a timely basis.\n\nRegulated subsidiaries of the Group are required to meet applicable PRA or local regulatory requirements pertaining to liquidity. Some of the regulated subsidiaries include Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Capital Securities Limited (which are regulated on a combined basis under a Domestic Liquidity Sub-Group (DoLSub) arrangement), Barclays Bank UK PLC, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Barclays Bank Delaware. Refer to the Liquidity risk section for further details of liquidity requirements, including those of the Group's significant subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distributions of capital and unrealised profits and generally to maintain solvency. These requirements restrict the ability of subsidiaries to make remittances of dividends to Barclays PLC, the ultimate parent, except in the event of a legal capital reduction or liquidation. In most cases, the regulatory restrictions referred to above exceed the statutory restrictions.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\n## Other restrictions\n\nThe Group uses its financial assets to raise finance in the form of securitisations and through the liquidity schemes of central banks, as well as to provide security to the UK Retirement Fund. Once encumbered, the assets are not available for transfer around the Group. The assets typically affected are disclosed in Note 38.\n\nThe Group is required to maintain balances with central banks and other regulatory authorities, and these amounted to \u00a34,750m (2020: \u00a33,392m).\n\n## 35 Structured entities\n\nDepending on the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\n\nA structured entity is an entity in which voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who  controls the entity.  Voting rights may relate to administrative tasks only, with the relevant activities of the entity being directed by means of contractual arrangements.  Structured entities are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined objective with restrictions around their ongoing activities.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\n- \u25a0 Securitisation vehicles: The Group uses securitisation as a source of financing and a means of risk transfer.  Where entities are controlled by the Group, they are consolidated.  Refer to Note 37 for further detail.\n\nThe Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of consolidated structured entities:\n\n- \u25a0 Commercial Paper (CP) conduits: These entities issue CP and use the proceeds to lend to clients as part of the Group's multi-seller conduit programme.   The Group has provided \u00a317.2bn (2020: \u00a316.9bn) in contractual liquidity facilities to the CP conduits that the Group consolidates. These amounts represent the maximum the conduits can lend externally. The amounts of CP conduit lending (drawn and undrawn) to unconsolidated structured entities can be seen in Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities under multi-seller conduit programme in the Nature of interest table.\n- \u25a0 Tender Option Bond (TOB)  trusts: During 2021, the Group provided undrawn liquidity facilities of \u00a33.3bn (2020: \u00a32.9bn) to consolidated TOB trusts. These trusts invest in fixed income instruments issued by state, local or other municipalities in the United States, funded by long-term senior floating-rate notes and junior residual securities.\n- \u25a0 Employee benefit trusts: The Group provides capital contributions to employee benefit trusts to enable them to meet obligations to employees in relation to share-based remuneration arrangements.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe term 'unconsolidated structured entities' refers to structured entities not controlled by Barclays, and are established either by Barclays or a third party. An interest in a structured entity is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variability in returns arising from the performance of the entity for the Group. Such interests include holdings of debt or equity securities, derivatives that transfer financial risks from the entity to the Group, lending, loan commitments, financial guarantees and investment management agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is predominantly within the CIB business. Structured entities may take the form of funds, trusts, securitisation vehicles, and private investment companies. The largest transactions for Barclays include loans and derivatives with hedge fund structures and special purpose entities, multi-seller conduit lending, holding notes issued by securitisation vehicles, and facilitating customer requirements through funds.\n\nThe nature and extent of the Group's interests in structured entities is summarised below:\n\n|                                                                   | Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities   | Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities   | Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities   | Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities   | Summary of interests in unconsolidated structured entities   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Secured financing                                            | Short-term traded  interests                                 | Traded derivatives                                           | Other interests                                              | Total                                                        |\n|                                                                   | \u00a3m                                                           | \u00a3m                                                           | \u00a3m                                                           | \u00a3m                                                           | \u00a3m                                                           |\n| As at 31 December 2021                                            |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |\n| Assets                                                            |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                          | -

For this reason, the total assets of these entities are not considered meaningful for the purposes of understanding the related risks and so have not been presented. Other interests include conduits and lending where the interest is driven by normal customer demand. As at 31 December 2021, there were 5,891 (2020: 3,394) structured entities that Barclays entered into transactions with.\n\nThe Group routinely enters into reverse repurchase contracts, margin lending, stock borrowing and similar arrangements on normal commercial terms where the counterparty to the arrangement is a structured entity. Due to the nature of these arrangements, especially the transfer of collateral and ongoing margining, the Group is able to manage its variable exposure to the performance of the structured entity counterparty. The counterparties included in secured financing mainly include hedge fund limited structures, investment companies and special purpose entities.\n\n## Secured financing\n\n## Short-term traded interests\n\n## Traded derivatives\n\nAs part of its market making activities, the Group buys and sells interests in structured vehicles, which are predominantly debt securities issued by asset securitisation vehicles. Such interests are typically held individually or as part of a larger portfolio for no more than 90 days. In such cases, the Group typically has no other involvement with the structured entity other than the securities it holds as part of trading activities and its maximum exposure to loss is restricted to the carrying value of the asset.\n\nThe Group enters into a variety of derivative contracts with structured entities which reference market risk variables such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit indices among other things. The main derivative types which are considered interests in structured entities include indexbased and entity specific credit default swaps, balance guaranteed swaps, total return swaps, commodities swaps, and equity swaps.  Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange derivatives that are not complex and which expose the Group to insignificant credit risk by being senior in the payment waterfall of a securitisation and derivatives that are determined to introduce risk or variability to a structured entity are not considered to be an interest in an entity and have been excluded from the disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of loss may be mitigated through ongoing margining requirements as well as a right to cash flows from the structured entity which are senior in the payment waterfall. Such margining requirements are consistent with market practice for many derivative arrangements and in line with the Group's normal credit policies.\n\nExcept for credit default swaps where the maximum exposure to loss is the swap notional amount, it is not possible to estimate the maximum exposure to loss in respect of derivative positions as the fair value of derivatives is subject to changes in market rates of interest, exchange rates and credit indices which by their nature are uncertain. In addition, the Group's losses would be subject to mitigating action under its traded market risk and credit risk policies that require the counterparty to provide collateral in cash or other assets in most cases.\n\nDerivative transactions require the counterparty to provide cash or other collateral under margining agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Group is mainly exposed to settlement risk on these derivatives which is mitigated through daily margining. Total notional contract amounts were \u00a3217,055m (2020: \u00a3153,894m).\n\n## Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities not held for the purposes of short-term trading activities are set out below, summarised by the nature of the interest and limited to significant categories, based on maximum exposure to loss.\n\n| Nature of interest                                                | Multi-seller conduit  programme \u00a3m   | Lending \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   | Of which: Barclays  owned, not  consolidated  entities a \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021                                            |                                      |              |            |            |                                                               |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | -

Exposure to loss is mitigated through collateral, financial guarantees, the availability of netting and credit protection held.\n\nBarclays' multi-seller conduit programme engages in providing financing to various clients and holds whole or partial interests in pools of receivables or similar obligations. These instruments are protected from loss through over-collateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit entities. The Group's off-balance sheet exposure included in the table above represents liquidity facilities that are provided to the conduit for the benefit of the holders of the commercial paper issued by the conduit and will only be drawn where the conduit is unable to access the commercial paper market. If these liquidity facilities are drawn, the Group is protected from loss through over-collateralisation, seller guarantees, or other credit enhancements provided to the conduit.\n\nThe portfolio includes lending provided by the Group to unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of its lending business to earn income in the form of interest and lending fees and includes loans to structured entities that are generally collateralised by property, equipment or other assets. All loans are subject to the Group's credit sanctioning process. Collateral arrangements are specific to the circumstances of each loan with additional guarantees and collateral sought from the sponsor of the structured entity for certain arrangements. During the period the Group incurred an impairment of \u00a328m (2020: \u00a323m) against such facilities.\n\n## Lending",

In addition, other includes investment funds with interests restricted to management fees based on performance of the fund and trusts held on behalf of beneficiaries with interests restricted to unpaid fees.\n\nBarclays is considered to sponsor another entity if, it had a key role in establishing that entity, it transferred assets to the entity, the Barclays name appears in the name of the entity or it provides guarantees on the entity's performance. As at 31 December 2021, assets transferred to sponsored unconsolidated structured entities were \u00a31,662m (2020: \u00a3730m).\n\n## 36 Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\n## Accounting for associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased (or decreased) each year by the Group's share of the post acquisition profit/(loss). The Group ceases to recognise its share of the losses of equity accounted associates when its share of the net assets and amounts due from the entity have been written off in full, unless it has a contractual or constructive obligation to make good its share of the losses. In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.\n\nThe Group applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements. Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies. Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares. Joint ventures are arrangements where the Group has joint control and rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nThe equity accounted Associates includes the Groups investment in the Business Growth Fund \u00a3699m (2020: \u00a3441m) which has increased due to a fair value gain in its investments by \u00a3220m (2020: \u00a3(23)m).\n\n|                                           | 2021       | 2021              | 2021   | 2020       | 2020           | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|--------|------------|----------------|--------|\n|                                           | Associates | Joint ventures \u00a3m | Total  | Associates | Joint ventures | Total  |\n|                                           | \u00a3m         |                   | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m             | \u00a3m     |\n| Equity accounted                          | 722        | 277               | 999    | 464        | 317            | 781    |\n| Held at fair value through profit or loss | -          | 444               | 444    | -          | 437            | 437    |\n| Total                                     | 722        | 721               | 1,443  | 464        | 754            | 1,218  |\n\nSummarised financial information for the Group's equity accounted associates and joint ventures is set out below.

Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.\n\nThe Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer. Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.\n\nIn the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficially, where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty. Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.\n\n## Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition\n\nA summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below:\n\n## Securitisations\n\nSecuritisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction. Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.\n\nThe Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its credit card balances and other personal lending. In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third party investors.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet:\n\n|                                                  | 2021             | 2021       | 2021             | 2021        | 2020             | 2020       | 2020             | 2020        |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|------------|------------------|-------------|\n|                                                  | Assets           | Assets     | Liabilities      | Liabilities | Assets           | Assets     | Liabilities      | Liabilities |\n|                                                  | Carrying  amount | Fair value | Carrying  amount | Fair value  | Carrying  amount | Fair value | Carrying  amount | Fair value  |\n|                                                  | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m               | \u00a3m          |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost             |                  |            |                  |             |                  |            |                  |             |\n| Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending | 1,303            | 1,423      | (1,225)          | (1,219)     | 1,033            | 1,121      | (1,019)          | (1,033)     |\n\nBalances included within loans and advances at amortised cost represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.\n\nIf Barclays transfers a financial asset but does not transfer or retain substantially all the risk and rewards of the asset and retains control over it, the transferred assets is recognised to the extent of Barclays' continuing involvement.  In 2021, financial assets of \u00a3249m (2020: \u00a3nil) was transferred in this manner and the carrying value of the asset representing continued involvement is included in the table above.\n\nThe relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.\n\nFor transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, refer to Note 38.",

This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Group's involvement with asset backed securities, residential mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities. Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.\n\n|                                        | Continuing involvement a   | Continuing involvement a   | Continuing involvement a   | Gain/(loss) from continuing involvement   | Gain/(loss) from continuing involvement   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | Carrying amount            | Fair value                 | Maximum exposure  to loss  | For the year ended                        | Cumulative to  Cumulative to  31 December |\n| Type of transfer                       | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m                         | \u00a3m                                        | \u00a3m                                        |\n| 2021                                   |                            |                            |                            |                                           |                                           |\n| Asset backed securities                | 25                         | 25                         | 25                         | 1                                         | 2                                         |\n| Residential mortgage backed securities | 574                        | 574                        | 574                        | 3                                         | 4                                         |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 311                        | 307                        | 311                        | 5                                         | 11                                        |\n| Total                                  | 910                        | 906                        | 910                        | 9                                         | 17                                        |\n| 2020                                   |                            |                            |                            |                                           |                                           |\n| Asset backed securities                | 56                         | 56                         | 56                         | 1                                         | 1                                         |\n| Residential mortgage backed securities | 49                         | 49                         | 49                         | 1                                         | 1                                         |\n| Commercial mortgage backed securities  | 243                        | 237                        | 243                        | 2                                         | 6                                         |\n| Total                                  | 348                        | 342                        | 348                        | 4                                         | 8                                         |\n\n## Note\n\n- a Assets which represent the Group's continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in Loans and advances at amortised cost and Debt securities at FVTP&L.\n\n## 38 Assets pledged, collateral received and assets transferred\n\nAssets pledged or transferred as collateral include all assets categorised as encumbered in the disclosure on pages 221 to 223 of the Barclays PLC Pillar 3 Report 2021 (unaudited), other than those held in commercial paper conduits. In these transactions, the Group will be required to step in to provide financing itself under a liquidity facility if the vehicle cannot access the commercial paper market.\n\nAssets are pledged or transferred as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives. Assets transferred are non-cash assets transferred to a third party that do not qualify for derecognition from the Group balance sheet, for example because Barclays retains substantially all the exposure to those assets under an agreement to repurchase them in the future for a fixed price.\n\nWhere non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral for cash received, the asset continues to be recognised in full, and a related liability is also recognised on the balance sheet. Where non-cash assets are pledged or transferred as collateral in an exchange for non-cash assets, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full, and there is no associated liability as the non-cash collateral received is not recognised on the balance sheet. The Group is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these pledged assets. Unless stated, the counterparty's recourse is not limited to the transferred assets.\n\nThe following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities:\n\n|                                                                   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash collateral and settlements                                   | 66,138    | 72,042    |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                              | 65,216    | 37,257    |\n| Trading portfolio assets                                          | 71,518    | 77,198    |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | 5,595     | 5,584     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 13,748    | 22,185    |\n| Assets pledged                                                    | 222,215   | 214,266   |",

The 2021 audit fee includes \u00a33m (2020: \u00a32m) relating to the previous year's audit.\n\n## 41 Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nPursuant to FCA announcements during 2021, panel bank submissions for all GBP, JPY and CHF LIBOR and Euro Overnight Index Average (EONIA) LIBOR tenors ceased, and representative LIBOR rates also ceased after 31 December 2021. For USD, certain actively used tenors will continue to be provided until June 2023, however in line with the US banking regulators' joint statement, Barclays ceased issuing or entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate from 31 December 2021, other than in relation to those allowable use cases set out under the FCA's prohibition notice (ref 21A). These include market making in support of client activity; or transactions that reduce or hedge the Barclays' or any client of the Barclays' US dollar LIBOR exposure on contracts entered into before 1 January 2022.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis, the reform and replacement of benchmark interest rates such as LIBOR has been a priority for global regulators. As a result, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other global regulators instructed market participants to prepare for the cessation of most LIBOR rates after the end of 2021, and to adopt 'near Risk-Free Rates' (RFRs).\n\nThe Group's exposure to rates subject to benchmark interest rate reform has been predominantly to GBP, USD, JPY and CHF LIBOR and EONIA with the vast majority concentrated in derivatives within the Corporate and Investment Bank. Some additional exposure resides on floating rate loans and advances, repurchase agreements and debt securities held and issued within the Corporate and Investment Bank. Retail lending and mortgage exposure in Barclays UK to LIBOR is minimal.  Following transition activity in late 2021 and early 2022, GBP, USD (one week and two month tenors), JPY and CHF LIBOR and EONIA positions ('2021 scope') have transitioned onto RFRs, and while there are a number of IBORs yet to cease,  the Group's risk exposure is now mainly to USD LIBOR.\n\nThere are key differences between IBORs and RFRs. IBORs are 'term rates', which means that they are published for a borrowing period (for example three months), and they are 'forward-looking', because they are published at the beginning of a borrowing period, based upon an estimated inter-bank borrowing cost for the period. RFRs are based upon overnight rates from actual transactions, and are therefore published after the end of the overnight borrowing period. Furthermore, IBORs include a credit spread over the RFRs. Therefore, to transition existing contracts and agreements to RFRs, adjustments for term and credit differences may need to be applied to RFR-linked rates. The methodologies for these adjustments have been determined through in-depth consultations by industry working groups, on behalf of the respective global regulators and related market participants.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Other disclosure matters continued\n\n## 41 Interest rate benchmark reform continued\n\n## How the Group is managing the transition to alternative benchmark rates\n\nThe Transition Programme follows a risk based approach, using recognised 'change delivery' control standards.  Accountable Executives are in place within key working groups and workstreams, with overall Board oversight delegated to the Board Risk Committee and the Group Finance Director. Barclays performs a prominent stewardship role to drive orderly transition via our representation on official sector and industry working groups across all major jurisdictions and product classes. Additionally, the Group Finance Director is Chair of the UK's 'Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates' (UK \u00a3RFRWG), whose mandate is to catalyse a broad-based transition to using SONIA ('Sterling Overnight Index Average') as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark in bond, loan and derivatives markets.\n\nBarclays has established a Group-wide LIBOR Transition Programme, with oversight from the Group Finance Director. The Transition Programme spans all business lines and has cross-functional governance which includes Legal, Compliance, Conduct Risk, Client Engagement and Communications, Risk, and Finance. The Transition Programme aims to drive strategic execution, and identify, manage and resolve key risks and issues as they arise. Barclays' transition plans primarily focus on G5 currencies while providing quarterly updates on progress and exposures to the PRA/FCA and other regulators as required.\n\nApproaches to transition exposure expiring post the expected end dates for LIBOR vary by product and nature of counterparty. The Group has actively engaged with the counterparties to transition or include appropriate fallback provisions and transition mechanisms in its floating rate assets and liabilities with maturities after 2021, when relevant IBORs excluding USD LIBOR cease to be published. The fallback will provide the relevant replacement rate, in the case of the ISDA Protocol this is the RFR plus a credit adjusted spread, that should be used post cessation or pre-cessation of the relevant IBOR. For the derivative population, adherence to the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol has provided Barclays with an efficient mechanism to amend outstanding trades to incorporate fallbacks. Beyond the ISDA IBOR Fallbacks Protocol, other options have included terminating or bilaterally agreeing new terms with counterparties. Derivative contracts facing central clearing counterparties have followed a market-wide, standardised approach to reform through a series of CCP-led conversions.\n\nAs announced by the FCA on 5 March 2021, USD LIBOR tenors (except 1 week and 2 month tenors) will cease to be representative from 30 June 2023. As detailed above, the key area of focus for transition prior to 2022 was on the other non-USD IBOR currency-tenors  that ceased to be published at the end of 2021. Cessation of new USD LIBOR trading and transition of USD LIBOR exposures is the priority for the Barclays LIBOR Transition Programme in 2022/23. Clients and colleagues have been notified that we have prohibited entering into new USD LIBOR transactions (with narrow permitted exceptions) from 1 January 2022 in line with regulatory expectations.\n\nThe FCA has authorised broad usage of synthetic LIBOR as a temporary solution for the 'tough legacy' population of unremediated contracts for GBP and JPY. Given cleared derivatives for the 2021 scope transitioned via CCP driven conversions, synthetic LIBOR does not apply in this context. Barclays' strategy remains to actively transition LIBOR exposure where viable, and/or to implement and utilise robust contractual fallbacks where possible. Where contracts remain unremediated, they may be able to utilise synthetic LIBOR on a temporary basis.  Barclays will continue to monitor, assess and limit the reliance on synthetic LIBOR.\n\nWhilst synthetic LIBOR will be published on a temporary basis for 1, 3 and 6 month tenors of GBP and JPY LIBOR to assist the transition of certain exposures, no synthetic rate has been announced for USD LIBOR. New York State legislation has been enacted (with US Federal legislation to follow) which provides a solution for contracts governed under New York law for USD LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) transition with the additional benefit of statutory contract continuity and safe harbour protection.  This contrasts with the legislation implemented in the UK which provides for statutory contract continuity with safe harbour protection only for the administrator, and could expose market participants to additional litigation risk. Clients have been engaged on the transition of their legacy USD LIBOR exposures through active transition or the implementation of fallbacks, and have been issued with communications on key regulatory developments in the transition away from USD LIBOR.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group delivered RFR product capabilities and alternatives to LIBOR across loans, bonds, securities financing transactions and derivatives required for LIBOR cessation to support transition of legacy contracts. Barclays has transitioned over 99% (by gross notional exposure) of legacy positions in those rates within the 2021 scope, onto new RFRs in line with official sector expectations and milestones.  This has been achieved through bilateral negotiation of contracts with clients, including the use of appropriate fallback provisions (which became effective post 31 December 2021, however, note that the switch onto the RFR may not take place until next reset post 31 December 2021 and so exposures may still be reported as LIBOR) and taking part in large scale transition events at a number of Central Counterparty Clearing Houses (London Clearing House (LCH), Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), EUREX and Japan Securities Clearing Corporation (JSCC) for OTC derivatives and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) EU and LCH CurveGlobal for exchange traded derivatives). In relation to those contracts yet to be transitioned, we remain in active dialogue with clients. Barclays transitioned the EONIA / LIBOR language in all active Credit Support Annexes (CSAs) via a number of mechanisms, primarily through bilateral CSA amendments but also by means of adherence to the ISDA 2021 EONIA Collateral Agreement Fallbacks Protocol. Barclays delivered technology and business process changes required to ensure operational readiness in preparation for LIBOR cessation and transitions to RFRs for those benchmark rates ceasing at the end of 2021. Any incremental Technology or Business Process changes required to support USD LIBOR cessation will be delivered ahead of 30 June 2023.  Whilst the majority of IBOR exposures have moved to RFRs, where appropriate other rates such as fixed rates or Bank of England base rates have also been used.\n\n## Progress made during 2021\n\n## Risks to which the Group is exposed as a result of the transition\n\nGlobal regulators and central banks in the UK, US and EU have been driving international efforts to reform key benchmark interest rates and indices, such as LIBOR, which are used to determine the amounts payable under a wide range of transactions and make them more reliable and robust. These benchmark reforms have resulted in significant changes to the methodology and operation of certain benchmarks and indices, the adoption of RFRs, the discontinuation of certain reference rates (including LIBOR), and the introduction of implementing legislation and regulations. Specifically, regulators in",

        "page_content": "## 41 Interest rate benchmark reform continued\n\nthe UK, US and EU have directed that certain non-US dollar LIBOR tenors cease at the end of 2021.  Certain US dollar LIBOR tenors are to cease by the end of June 2023, and restrictions have been imposed on new use of USD LIBOR. Notwithstanding these developments, given the unpredictable consequences of benchmark reform, any of these developments could have an adverse impact on market participants, including the Group, in respect of any financial instruments linked to, or referencing, any of these benchmark interest rates.\n\n- \u25a0 Conduct risk:  in undertaking actions to transition away from using certain reference rates (such as LIBOR) to new alternative RFRs, the Group faces conduct risks. These may lead to customer complaints, regulatory sanctions or reputational impact if the Group is considered to be (among other things) (i) undertaking market activities that are manipulative or create a false or misleading impression, (ii) misusing sensitive information or not identifying or appropriately managing or mitigating conflicts of interest, (iii) providing customers with inadequate advice, misleading information, unsuitable products or unacceptable service, (iv)not taking a consistent approach to remediation for customers in similar circumstances, (v) unduly delaying the communication and migration activities in relation to client exposure, leaving them insufficient time to prepare, or (vi) colluding or inappropriately sharing information with competitors.\n\nUncertainty associated with such potential changes, including the availability and/or suitability of alternative RFRs, the participation of customers and third-party market participants in the transition process; challenges with respect to required documentation changes; and impact of legislation to deal with 'certain legacy' contracts that cannot convert into or add fall-back RFRs before cessation of the benchmark they reference, may adversely affect a broad range of transactions (including any securities, loans and derivatives which use LIBOR or any other affected benchmark to determine the amount of interest payable that are included in the Group's financial assets and liabilities) that use these reference rates and indices, and present a number of risks for the Group, including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u25a0 Litigation risk: members of the Group may face legal proceedings, regulatory investigations and/or other actions or proceedings regarding (among other things) (i) the conduct risks identified above, (ii) the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in LIBOR-based contracts, and (iii) the Group's preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with alternative RFRs.\n- \u25a0 Pricing risk: changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or indices and transition to alternative RFRs may impact the pricing mechanisms used by the Group on certain transactions.\n- \u25a0 Financial risk: the valuation of certain of the Group's financial assets and liabilities may change. Moreover, transitioning to alternative RFRs may impact the ability of members of the Group to calculate and model amounts receivable by them on certain financial assets and determine the amounts payable on certain financial liabilities (such as debt securities issued by them) because certain alternative RFRs (such as SONIA and the SOFR) are look-back rates whereas term rates (such as LIBOR) allow borrowers to calculate at the start of any interest period exactly how much is payable at the end of such interest period. This may have a material adverse effect on the Group's cash flows.\n- \u25a0 Operational risk: changes to existing reference rates and indices, discontinuation of any reference rate or index and transition to alternative RFRs may require changes to the Group's IT systems, trade reporting infrastructure, operational processes, and controls. In addition, if any reference rate or index (such as LIBOR) is no longer available to calculate amounts payable, the Group may incur additional expenses in amending documentation for new and existing transactions and/or effecting the transition from the original reference rate or index to a new reference rate or index.\n\nAny of these factors may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation. While a number of the above risks in relation to transition of legacy 2021 scope onto RFRs have been substantially mitigated, they remain relevant in relation to USD and related LIBOR rate transitions.\n\n- \u25a0 Accounting risk: an inability to apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 could lead to increased volatility in the Group's financial results and performance.\n\nThe Group does not expect material changes to its risk management approach and strategy as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe following table summarises the significant exposures impacted by interest rate benchmark reform:\n\n| As at 31 December 2021                                            | GBP LIBOR \u00a3m   | USD LIBOR \u00a3m   | JPY LIBOR  \u00a3m   | CHF LIBOR \u00a3m   | Others b \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|------------|\n| Non-derivative financial assets                                   |                |                |                 |                |               |            |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                              | 14,166         | 15,812         | 25              | 229            | 431           | 30,663     |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending   | -              | 186            | -               | -              | -             | 186        |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income statement       | 185            | 8,538          | 5               | 327            | 194           | 9,249      |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | -              | -              | -               | -              | -             | -          |\n| Non-derivative financial assets                                   | 14,351         | 24,536         | 30              | 556            | 625           | 40,098     |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                              |                |                |                 |                |               |            |\n| Debt securities in issue                                          | -              | (6,137)        | (1,083)         | -              | -             | (7,220)    |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                          | -              | (1,088)        | -               | -              | (113)         | (1,201)    |\n| Financial liabilities designated at fair value                    | (708)          | (212)          |                 |                |               | (920)      |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                              | (708)          | (7,437)        | (1,083)         | -              | (113)         | (9,341)    |\n| Equity                                                            |                |                |                 |                |               |            |\n| Other equity instruments                                          | -              | (3,374)        | (92)            | -              | -             | (3,466)    |\n| Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments a          | 60,490         | 42,767         | 1,284           | 371            | 12,724        | 117,636    |",

This has resulted in an increase in GBP LIBOR and a corresponding reduction in USD LIBOR exposure of \u00a334bn.  2020 comparatives have not been restated to reflect this change.\n\nThe table above represents the exposures to interest rate benchmark reform by balance sheet account, which have yet to transition. The exposure disclosed is for positions with contractual maturities after 31 December 2021 (apart from USD, which is for maturities after 30 June 2023). Trades with exposures to other IBORs whose respective cessation dates is in the future and mature before that date have been excluded (2020: exposures are disclosed for maturities after 31 December 2021 for all rates). Balances reported at amortised cost are disclosed at their gross carrying value and do not include any expected credit losses that may be held against them.\n\n|                                                                 | GBP LIBOR   | USD LIBOR   | EONIA     | JPY LIBOR   | CHF LIBOR   | Others a   | Total              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021                                          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m                 |\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             |             |             |           |             |             |            |                    |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives                                   | 240,183     | 2,283,236   | 7,811     | 140,357     | 4,396       | 61,937     | 2,737,920          |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives - cleared by central counterparty |             | - 2,228,399 | -         | -           | -           | 168,649    | 2,397,048          |\n| Exchange traded interest rate derivatives                       | -           | 466,339     | -         | -           | -           | -          | 466,339            |\n| OTC foreign exchange derivatives                                | 183,477     | 461,680     | -         | 122,823     | 32,900      | 1,419      | 802,299            |\n| OTC equity and stock index derivatives                          | -           | 9,949       | -         | -           | -           | -          | 9,949              |\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             | 423,660     | 5,449,603   | 7,811     | 263,180     | 37,296      | 232,005    | 6,413,555          |\n|                                                                 | GBP LIBOR   | USD LIBOR   | EONIA     | JPY LIBOR   | CHF LIBOR   | Others a   | Total              |\n| As at 31 December 2020                                          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m        | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m          | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m                 |\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             |             |             |           |             |             |            |                    |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives                                   | 592,827     | 2,832,802   | 457,844   | 754,206     | 25,681      | 41,782     | 4,705,142          |\n| OTC interest rate derivatives - cleared by central counterparty | 1,684,553   | 2,891,029   | 638,202   | 1,091,479   | 119,382     | 198,113    | 6,622,758          |\n| Exchange traded interest rate derivatives                       | 300,182     | 333,705     | -         | -           | 2,494       | -          | 636,381            |\n| OTC foreign exchange derivatives                                | 155,285     | 589,334     | -         | 93,108      | 31,257      | 1,921      | 870,905            |\n| OTC equity and stock index derivatives                          | 1,845       | 7,946       | 544       | 1,929       | 491         | 2,141      | 14,896             |\n| Derivative notional contract amount                             | 2,734,692   | 6,654,816   | 1,096,590 | 1,940,722   | 179,305     |            | 243,957 12,850,082 |\n\nThe following table  represents the derivative exposures to interest rate benchmark reform, which have yet to transition:\n\n## Note\n\n- a Includes  EUR LIBOR, SOR and STIBOR\n\nThe exposure disclosed is for positions with contractual maturities after 31 December 2021 (apart from USD, which is for maturities after 30 June 2023).

Fallbacks here are defined as any mechanism involving a 'switch' or 'hardwire' or a contractual agreement to transition to an automatically selected rate.  One of the most commonly used is the ISDA 2020 IBOR Protocol published in October 2020 which enabled market participants to incorporate fallback provisions into legacy non-cleared derivatives and certain non-derivatives transactions. Market participants who have adhered to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Protocol agree, between adhering parties, that their legacy contracts will be amended to include the relevant fallback provisions. In addition to this, ISDA developed bilateral Swap Rate Fallbacks templates for GBP and JPY Swap Rate bilateral derivative trades with the GBP ICE Swap Rate fallback provisions being published in August 2021 and the JPY ISDA Swap Rate fallback provisions being published in November 2021. Whilst the fallback provisions have been applied to the majority of trades, with some limited exceptions being worked through, the switch to the replacement rate as a result of fallback provision inclusion may not take place until the next rate reset post the cessation or pre-cessation event.\n\n|                                                              | With appropriate fallback clause   | With appropriate fallback clause   | With appropriate fallback clause   | With appropriate fallback clause   | With appropriate fallback clause   | Without appropriate fallback clause   | Without appropriate fallback clause   | Without appropriate fallback clause   | Without appropriate fallback clause   | Without appropriate fallback clause   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                              | GBP LIBOR                          | JPY LIBOR                          | CHF LIBOR                          | EUR LIBOR                          | Total                              | GBP LIBOR                             | JPY LIBOR                             | CHF LIBOR                             | EUR LIBOR                             | Total                                 |\n| As at 31 December 2021                                       | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                 | \u00a3m                                    | \u00a3m                                    | \u00a3m                                    | \u00a3m                                    | \u00a3m                                    |\n| Non-derivative financial assets                              |                                    |                                    |                                    |                                    |                                    |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Loans and advances at amortised cost                         | 9,434                              | 5                                  | 215                                | 412                                | 10,066                             | 4,732                                 | 20                                    | 14                                    | 19                                    | 4,785                                 |\n| Financial assets at fair value through the income  statement | 125                                | 5                                  | 327                                | 8                                  | 465                                | 60                                    | -

In many cases, work is ongoing to transition trades or insert fallbacks prior to the next rate reset. There may be some scenarios where synthetic LIBOR is temporarily used whilst Barclays continues to work with the client to remediate their exposures, with little expectation of longer term usage. It is also key to note that not all remaining exposures can leverage synthetic LIBOR. CHF LIBOR, EUR LIBOR and EONIA do not have any synthetic LIBOR available and only the more commonly used, 1M, 3M and 6M GBP LIBOR and JPY LIBOR tenors have a synthetic rate being published. The volume of these residual exposures is very low and work is focused on transitioning these prior to next reset.\n\nThe majority of remaining exposures where no synthetic rate is available are bilateral derivatives using GBP/JPY Swap Rates within the Markets businesses. The focus for these is agreeing the bilateral swap rate fallbacks that were published by ISDA in August (for GBP) and November (for JPY) 2021. Continued uptake of these bilateral fallbacks has been seen in early 2022.",

As part of a response to this announcement, Barclays PLC took steps to provide additional capital to its banking subsidiaries.\n\nOther income of \u00a3659m (2020: \u00a31,192m, 2019: \u00a31,760m) includes \u00a3804m (2020: \u00a3857m, 2019: \u00a3813m) of income received from gross coupon payments on Barclays Bank PLC and Barclays Bank UK PLC issued AT1 securities and \u00a3250m (2020: \u00a3248m) of fair value and foreign exchange losses on other positions with subsidiaries.\n\n## Other income\n\n## Total assets and liabilities\n\nThe investment in subsidiaries of \u00a362,528m (2020: \u00a358,886m) predominantly relates to investments in the ordinary shares of Barclays Bank PLC of \u00a335,590m (2020: \u00a335,590m) and their AT1 securities of \u00a39,493m (2020: \u00a38,425m), as well as investments in the ordinary shares of Barclays Bank UK PLC of \u00a314,245m (2020: 11,675m) and their AT1 securities of \u00a32,570m (2020: \u00a32,570m). The increase of \u00a33,642m during the year was predominantly driven by a \u00a32,573m reversal of impairment in the cost of investment of Barclays Bank UK PLC and increased AT1 holdings of $1,500m in Barclays Bank PLC.\n\n## Investment in subsidiaries\n\n## Impairment in subsidiaries\n\nDue to the improved market conditions and interest rate environment for the Group's UK banking business compared to December 2020 the review further identified that the accumulated impairment for the investment in Barclays Bank UK PLC of \u00a32,573m no longer existed. The VIU of Barclays Bank UK PLC was found to be significantly higher than both the carrying amount of the investment and the gross cost of the investment and hence all accumulated impairment has been reversed in December 2021. For Barclays Bank UK PLC, a discount rate of 14.5% (2020: 13.8%) has been applied to the cash flow forecast. In determining the discount rate, management have identified a cost of equity associated with market participants that closely resemble the subsidiary and adjusted for tax to arrive at the pre-tax equivalent rate. A terminal growth rate of 2.0% (2020: 2.0%) has been used to calculate a terminal value for the investment based on inflation rates to approximate future long term growth.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period an impairment review is undertaken in respect of investment in the ordinary shares of subsidiaries. Where impairment may be indicated a test of the carrying value against the recoverable value is performed. Impairment being indicated where the investment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is calculated as a value in use (VIU) which is derived from the present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the investment. The VIU calculations use forecast attributable profit based on financial budgets approved by management, covering a five year period as an approximation of future cash flows discounted using a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the subsidiary being tested.  A terminal growth rate has then been applied to the cash flows thereafter which is based upon expectations of future inflation rates. The review identified the value in use calculated was higher than the carrying value for all subsidiaries.\n\n## Loans and advances in subsidiaries\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities designated at fair value\n\nDuring the year, loans and advances to subsidiaries decreased by \u00a32,638m to \u00a322,072m (2020: \u00a324,710m). The decrease was driven by the maturity of \u00a32,400m dated subordinated loans in relation to Barclays Bank PLC and the maturity of \u00a31,100m dated subordinated notes in relation to Barclays Bank UK PLC. This was partially offset by c\u00a31,600m new issuances of dated subordinated notes by Barclays Bank  PLC to Barclays PLC.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value of \u00a316,319m (2020: \u00a39,507m) primarily included new issuances during the year of $5,000m and \u20ac1,500m Fixed Rate Resetting Senior Callable Notes, \u20ac750m Floating Rate Senior Callable Notes and $500m Zero Coupon Callable Notes. The proceeds raised through these transactions were used to invest in subsidiaries of Barclays PLC and are included within the financial assets designated at fair value through the income statement balance of \u00a325,091m (2020: \u00a317,521m). The effect of changes in the liabilities' fair value, including those due to credit risk, is expected to offset the changes in the fair value of the related financial asset in the income statement. The difference between the financial liabilities' carrying amount and the contractual amount on maturity is \u00a3271m (2020: \u00a3324m).\n\nDuring the year, Barclays PLC issued \u20ac1,000m and $1,000m of Fixed Rate Resetting Subordinated Callable Notes, which are included within the subordinated liabilities balance of \u00a39,301m (2020: \u00a37,724m). Debt securities in issue of \u00a325,658m (2020: \u00a328,428m) have reduced in the year due to the maturity of positions with subsidiaries.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities and debt securities in issue\n\n## Management of internal investments, loans and advances\n\nBarclays PLC retains the discretion to manage the nature of its internal investments in subsidiaries according to their regulatory and business needs. Barclays PLC may invest capital and funding into Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays Bank UK PLC and other Group subsidiaries such as Barclays Execution Services Limited and the US Intermediate Holding Company (IHC).",

Reported numbers reflect best estimates and judgements at the given point in time.\n\nThe terms Barclays or Group refer to Barclays PLC together with its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise stated, the income statement analysis compares the year ended 31 December 2021 to the corresponding twelve months of 2020 and balance sheet analysis as at 31 December 2021 with comparatives relating to 31 December 2020. The abbreviations '\u00a3m' and '\u00a3bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Pounds Sterling respectively; the abbreviations '$m' and '$bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of US Dollars respectively; and the abbreviations '\u20acm' and '\u20acbn' represent millions and thousands of millions of Euros respectively.\n\nRelevant terms that are used in this document but are not defined under applicable regulatory guidance or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are explained in the results glossary that can be accessed at home.barclays/ investor-relations/reports-and-events/ latest-financial-results.\n\nThese results will be filed on a Form 20-F with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as soon as practicable following their publication. Once filed with the SEC, a copy of the Form 20-F will be available from the Barclays Investor Relations website at home.barclays/ annualreport and from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Barclays is a frequent issuer in the debt capital markets and regularly meets with investors via formal road-shows and other ad hoc meetings. Consistent with its usual practice, Barclays expects that from time to time over the coming quarter it will meet with investors globally to discuss these results and other matters relating to the Group.\n\nThe information in this document, which was approved by the Board of Directors on 22 February 2022, does not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021, which contain an unmodified audit report under Section 495 of the Companies Act 2006 (which does not make any statements under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006), will be delivered to the Registrar of Companies in accordance with Section 441 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Non-IFRS performance measures\n\nBarclays' management believes that the non-IFRS performance measures included in this document provide valuable information to the readers of the financial statements as they enable the reader to identify a more consistent basis for comparing the businesses' performance between financial periods and provide more detail concerning the elements of performance which the managers of these businesses are most directly able to influence or are relevant for an assessment of the Group. They also reflect an important aspect of the way in which operating targets are defined and performance is monitored by Barclays' management. However, any non-IFRS performance measures in this document are not a substitute for IFRS measures and readers should consider the IFRS measures as well. Refer to pages 309 to 312 for further information and calculations of non-IFRS performance measures included throughout this document, and the most directly comparable IFRS measures.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as at the date on which they are made. Forward-looking statements may be affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation: changes in legislation; the development of standards and interpretations under IFRS, including evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of accounting and regulatory standards, emerging and developing ESG reporting standards; the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; future levels of conduct provisions; the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities; the Group's ability along with governments and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; environmental, social and geopolitical risks; and the impact of competition. In addition, factors including (but not limited to) the following may have an effect: capital, leverage and other regulatory rules applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions; the effects of any volatility in credit markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; effects of changes in valuation of credit market exposures; changes in valuation of issued securities; volatility in capital markets; changes in credit ratings of any entity within the Group or any securities issued by such entities; direct and indirect impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic; instability as a result of the UK's exit from the European Union (\"EU\"), the effects of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the disruption that may subsequently result in the UK and globally; the risk of cyber-attacks, information or security\n\nThis document contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended, with respect to the Group. Barclays cautions readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results or other financial condition or performance measures could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as 'may', 'will', 'seek', 'continue', 'aim', 'anticipate', 'target', 'projected', 'expect', 'estimate', 'intend', 'plan', 'goal', 'believe', 'achieve' or other words of similar meaning. Forwardlooking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by members of the management of the Group (including, without limitation, during management presentations to financial analysts) in connection with this document.Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements or guidance regarding or relating to the Group's future financial position, income growth, assets, impairment charges, provisions, business strategy, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, capital distributions (including dividend pay-out ratios and expected payment strategies), projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets, projected costs or savings, any commitments and targets (including, without limitation,  ESG commitments and targets), estimates of capital expenditures, plans and objectives for future operations, projected employee numbers, IFRS impacts and other statements that are not historical fact. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances.\n\nbreaches or technology failures on the Group's reputation, business or operations; and the success of future acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group's control. As a result, the Group's actual financial position, future results, capital distributions, capital, leverage or other regulatory ratios or other financial and non-financial metrics or performance measures or ability to meet commitments and targets may differ materially from the statements or guidance set forth in the Group's forward-looking statements. Additional risks and factors which may impact the Group's future financial condition and performance are identified in Barclays PLC's filings with the SEC (including, without limitation, our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2021), which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Subject to Barclays' obligations under the applicable laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdiction, (including, without limitation, the UK and the US), in relation to disclosure and ongoing information, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\nThis document is printed on Revive 100 Offset, made from 100% FSC\u00ae Recycled certified fibre sourced from de-inked post-consumer waste.

Together.\n\n## Financing the transition\n\nFluence is a global market leader in energy storage products and services, as well as digital applications for renewables and storage. Energy storage technology is at the centre of the decarbonisation of the electric grid and has a critical role to play in enabling the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThis year, Barclays supported Fluence by helping them float on the NASDAQ through an Initial Public Offering (IPO). We helped market the IPO over a seven-day virtual roadshow, highlighting the important role Fluence is playing in the transition to the low-carbon economy, as well as the pure-play exposure it provides to investors looking to capitalise on the growing global demand for energy storage and digital capabilities.\n\nBarclays PLC Annual Report 2021 A detailed review of Barclays' 2021 performance with disclosures that provide useful insight and go beyond reporting requirements.\n\nBarclays PLC Climate-related Financial Disclosures 2021 A report aligning to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in this, the fifth year of disclosure.\n\nLeft:\n\nRebecca Boll\n\nBarclays Head of Power & Utilities, Americas\n\nChief Product Officer, Fluence\n\nRight:\n\nJohn Plaster\n\nRegistered office: 1 Churchill Place, London E14 5HP \u00a9 Barclays PLC 2022 Registered in England.

As of February 10, 2022, Fluence, a Siemens and AES company, already has more than 4.6 GW of energy storage deployed or contracted in 30 markets, and approximately 6 GW of wind, solar and storage assets contracted or under management in Australia and California.
