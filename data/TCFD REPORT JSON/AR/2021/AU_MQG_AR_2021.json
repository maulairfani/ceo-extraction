Vaccines have become widely available, precipitating a global economic recovery that has so far proven largely resilient, notwithstanding current geo-political and inflationary challenges. While the ebb and flow of case numbers and the possibility of new variants remains, the world has increasingly adapted to a new normal of living with the virus.\n\nMacquarie's FY2022 performance reflects strong results across the organisation as our operating and support groups again delivered on their commitment to supporting our clients, partners and communities. Macquarie Group CEO, Shemara Wikramanayake, provides further detail on Macquarie's financial performance in her letter to shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's performance reflects strong results across the organisation as our operating businesses and support groups again delivered on their commitment to supporting our clients, partners and communities.'\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I commend the efforts of our staff and extend our thanks for their resilience and continued outperformance in uncertain times. Globally, we have formalised an ongoing approach to hybrid working, with our teams delivering effectively as they split their working days between the office and home, in line with our hybrid working principles. This model of working is supported by the Board and Management, underpinned by significant investment in technology to ensure that staff can continue to discharge their duties to high standards, meet regulatory obligations and remain connected with their colleagues and clients.\n\n## Macquarie culture\n\nOur purpose of 'empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future' is deeply embedded in Macquarie's culture and is underpinned by our longstanding operating principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. These foundational aspects of our culture are further distilled in Macquarie's Code of Conduct , which sets out the expectations of Management and staff in managing their responsibilities and conducting themselves.",

        "page_content": "A core responsibility of Macquarie's Board and Management is ensuring the highest level of professional conduct across our operations - a commitment that has been in place since Macquarie's inception 53 years ago. We actively manage and enhance our risk culture and the Conduct Risk Management Framework in response to changes in our business operations, outcomes of our oversight activities and the expectations of regulators and communities. The Board and Management also regularly review and enhance our reporting, training, monitoring and surveillance activity. Everyone at Macquarie is accountable for their conduct, and supervisors are accountable for outcomes in their businesses with independent oversight by the Risk Management Group.\n\nIn relation to the APRA matters we noted last year, the Board has worked closely with Management on a comprehensive remediation plan. We believe the changes proposed under this plan will have a positive impact on Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) through improved systems, frameworks and processes for regulatory reporting and prudential risk management; enhanced governance, risk culture and remuneration framework; and a simplified group structure.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance\n\nThe Board and Management recognise the importance of sound environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices as part of our responsibility to our clients, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nESG considerations guide and inform the way we conduct our business operations and manage risk, and it is our responsibility to uphold these practices to build towards a better future. The ESG section of this Annual Report and our website provide further details on the part we are playing in investing to drive solutions across diverse sources of emissions, supporting our clients with their own net zero commitments and contributing to global policy formation through the roles the Macquarie Group CEO and other executives hold on a range of supranational panels and commissions.\n\nIn early FY2022, we made a commitment to reach net zero operational emissions by 2025 and to align our financing activity with the global goal of net zero emissions by 2050. While our equity and lending exposure to fossil fuels is smaller than many peers, detailed work has been underway to assess our own and our clients' activities. I am pleased to note that we are on track to release our detailed net zero plan by the end of 2022, while Macquarie Asset Management is also working on asset-level plans to the same timetable. This activity forms part of a broader suite of ESG initiatives and reporting, which we expect will continue to evolve over the coming years.\n\n## Board changes\n\nTowards the end of FY2022, we welcomed Michelle Hinchliffe to the MGL and MBL Boards, following the previously announced retirement of Diane Grady. Michelle's deep knowledge of finance and financial services and her global experience will be of great value to the Boards and our businesses. Furthermore, Michelle's appointment maintains gender parity on the MGL Board, which reflects our ongoing commitment to achieving gender equity at all levels of our workforce. Michael Coleman has announced his intention to retire as a Voting Director of MGL and MBL after 10 years on the Boards. Michael's retirement will be effective at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. Gordon Cairns retired in May 2021 after six years on the Boards. I would like to reiterate my thanks to Diane, Michael and Gordon for their important contributions to Macquarie over many years.\n\nAs previously announced, I will retire as Chair with the delivery of our FY2022 results, after 15 years on the Macquarie Boards. With this letter being my last as Chairman, I want to take the opportunity to thank my Board colleagues, Management and staff for their leadership and commitment. I have immensely enjoyed my time at Macquarie and appreciated working alongside such incredibly talented people delivering tirelessly to address unmet community need. It has been a privilege to play a part in Macquarie's growth, which has seen a threefold increase in our profitability and a doubling in the size of our team since I joined the Board.\n\nI'd like to extend my thanks and best wishes to my successor as Chair, Glenn Stevens. Glenn has already made significant contributions to our Board discussions and committees in recent years and his appointment places Macquarie in good stead thanks to his extensive experience in markets and economics after many years as a successful Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board resolved to pay a final ordinary dividend of $A3.50 per share (40% franked). This results in a total ordinary dividend for the year ended 31 March 2022 of $A6.22 per share, up from $A4.70 in the prior year.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, and for my final time as Chairman, I would like to thank Macquarie's staff for their efforts, and our clients and shareholders for their considerable support, including for our capital raising in late 2021, which has enabled us to achieve this strong result in FY2022 and sustained performance over many years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Peter Warne\n\nIndependent Director and Chairman\n\nSydney 6 May 2022",

Over time, this has seen us build deep and differentiated franchises in each of our areas of activity, all of which delivered strong performance in FY2022.'\n\n## Letter from the\n\n## Managing Director and CEO\n\nAgainst an uncertain backdrop, Macquarie's teams remained focused on delivering for our clients, partners, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. Supported by our central teams and empowered to identify and capitalise on opportunities in line with our purpose, all four Macquarie operating groups increased their overall net profit contribution in FY2022.\n\nWhile many of the regions and markets in which Macquarie operates saw heightened levels of volatility this year, our longstanding strategy to address key areas of unmet need in the community is unchanged. Over time, this has seen us build deep and differentiated franchises in each of our areas of activity, all of which delivered sound outcomes and strong performance in FY2022.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2022, Macquarie delivered a profit of $A4,706 million, up 56% on the prior year, with three of the four operating groups delivering their best-ever performance. This result reflects our continued emphasis on areas underpinning long-term global economic growth, our agility and adaptability in uncertain times, and our ongoing commitment to prudent risk management. While each of our franchises continued to grow strongly, the result was also supported by some exceptional elements, in terms of specific assets\n\nrealised during the year and a heightened need to support clients through volatile markets.\n\nIn Macquarie Asset Management (MAM), excluding the impact of acquisitions, income related to the disposition of Macquarie Infrastructure Corporation (MIC) assets together with growth in base fees were partially offset by gains on the sale of Macquarie European Rail in the prior year and lower performance fees. Banking and Financial Services (BFS) benefited from strong growth in home loans, funds on platform and total BFS deposits together with releases in net credit impairments. This was partially offset by increased technology investment and higher average headcount costs to support business growth and regulatory requirements.\n\nCommodities and Global Markets (CGM) saw increased revenue from Commodities with strong risk management demand driven by increased client hedging activity and trading activity as a result of elevated volatility and commodity price movements. The contribution from Commodities inventory management and trading was also up while Financial Markets continued to deliver strong performance. The contribution from Asset Finance also increased, largely related to the partial sale of the UK Meters portfolio and increased activity across its other sectors. Macquarie Capital saw significantly higher fee and commission income due to mergers and acquisitions and debt capital markets activities. This was partially offset by lower equity capital markets fee income and brokerage income. Investment-related income was up substantially due to material asset realisations in the green energy, technology and business services sectors and an increase in the private credit portfolio.\n\nTo provide us with additional flexibility to invest in new opportunities while maintaining an appropriate capital surplus, we raised $A2.8 billion",

These offers received strong interest from institutional and retail shareholders respectively and were successfully completed towards the end of 2021. I would like to thank shareholders for their support in providing this capital for further growth. Macquarie Group remains well capitalised, with APRA Basel III Capital of $A33.6 billion at 31 March 2022 and a surplus of $A10. 7 billion.\n\nWe have previously communicated our work with APRA to create a remediation plan that strengthens MBL's governance, culture, structure and remuneration to ensure full and ongoing compliance with prudential standards. The plan was approved and endorsed by the MBL Board in FY2022 and is broad-ranging and comprehensive, including detailed programs of work across governance, remuneration, risk culture, regulatory reporting, prudential risk management and group structure. Management is committed to advancing this work through FY2023 and beyond.\n\n## Investing in a sustainable future\n\nDuring the year, we announced the move of Macquarie's Green Investment Group (GIG) from Macquarie Capital into MAM, which took effect from 1 April 2022. The need for climate investment has grown substantially in GIG's focus areas and the move brings together our specialist capabilities in green finance to respond to investor appetite for long-term investment across the asset lifecycle as we seek to address broad sources of emissions from energy, transportation, agriculture, industry, waste and real estate.\n\nMacquarie is committed to playing a leading role in driving the global transition to net zero. Alongside our own investment commitment and working with clients to deliver practical climate solutions, we are playing an active role in the mobilisation of private capital through our participation in global initiatives such as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative (CFLI), for which I act as Co-Chair of the India workstream.\n\n## Management update\n\nDuring FY2022, following the retirement of Mary Reemst after 22 years with Macquarie, Stuart Green became Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of MBL on 1 July 2021 and joined the MBL Board and the MGL and MBL Executive Committees.\n\nAfter 22 years with Macquarie, Daniel Wong stepped down as Co-Head of Macquarie Capital and from Macquarie's Executive Committee, on 29 October 2021. Michael Silverton, Daniel's Co-Head, became sole Group Head of Macquarie Capital.\n\nPatrick Upfold stepped down as Chief Risk Officer, Head of the Risk Management Group (RMG) and from Macquarie's Executive Committee on 31 December 2021, after 25 years with Macquarie. Patrick remains with Macquarie until mid-2022 to complete an extended handover to his successor, Andrew Cassidy, who has been with Macquarie for 18 years. Andrew joined Macquarie's Executive Committee on 1 January 2022.\n\nMichael Herring retired as Group General Counsel and Head of the Legal and Governance Group on 6 May 2022 after 17 years with Macquarie. Evie Bruce, previously Australian Managing Partner for King & Wood Mallesons Australia's Mergers & Acquisitions and Banking & Finance practice teams joined Macquarie in January 2022 and has undertaken an extended handover period before taking over Michael's responsibilities. Evie joined Macquarie's Executive Committee on 2 March 2022.\n\nIn addition to the new Executive Committee members noted above, Verena Lim, Macquarie's Asia CEO; Leigh Harrison, the global head of MAM's Real Assets business; and Tim Whitehead, global head of RMG Credit all joined Macquarie's Management Committee.\n\n## In the community\n\nConsistent with the social impact that our businesses seek to drive from their investments, our people and the Macquarie Group Foundation together contributed $A44 million in funding and thousands of hours of time to community organisations across the globe in FY2022.\n\nFurthermore, the remainder of the $A20 million COVID-19 donation fund launched at the start of the pandemic in 2020 was fully deployed to 40 organisations in 32 countries during the year, while the $A50 million in additional grants allocated in 2019 to mark Macquarie's 50th anniversary continued to be deployed as those projects advanced. More detail is provided in this report.\n\nA further one-off $A20 million allocation was made in FY2022 to expand the Foundation's Social Impact Investing program and help address employment, education and economic empowerment needs. In support of communities and families across Ukraine, the Foundation and Macquarie employees also made a $A3.5 million donation to the critical humanitarian and refugee response.\n\nA total of $A520 million has now been contributed to philanthropic causes by our people and the Foundation since it was established in 1985.\n\n## External outlook\n\nAs more parts of the world transition to a managed phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen improvement to overall economic sentiment and in market conditions. In the near term, global growth looks set to remain strong, but the outlook remains uncertain, as the invasion of Ukraine and further outbreaks of COVID-19 add to already high inflationary pressures and increase the likelihood of interest rate rises in many advanced economies.\n\nWhile we haven't provided overall guidance for the 2023 financial year, we have provided the market with an outline of the factors impacting the short-term outlook for each of our operating groups. We maintain a cautious stance, with a conservative approach to capital, funding and liquidity that positions us well to respond to the current environment.\n\n## Chair succession\n\nOn behalf of Macquarie's management team and our staff, I would like to thank Peter Warne for his significant contribution to Macquarie over the past 15 years. Peter has been an insightful and highly engaged Chair through many milestone events for Macquarie and I also express my appreciation for the steadfast support he has given to me since I became CEO. He retires with our best wishes for the future, and I look forward to working with his experienced successor, Glenn Stevens.\n\nWe would also like to thank Macquarie's staff for their hard work and commitment in delivering this result in exceptional times, and our clients and shareholders for their ongoing support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shemara Wikramanayake\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSydney 6 May 2022",

In the UK, we have invested over \u00a3800 million on behalf of clients over the past five years in the affordable housing sector.\n\nTo support increased demand for digital infrastructure, especially in rural and more remote regions, we are investing in new networks and technology. This includes the creation of Spain's first independent fibre network operator to connect people and businesses outside larger urban areas, and the accelerated rollout of UK fibre to provide broadband to poorly connected communities. Taking advantage of this improved connectivity, we continue to invest directly in innovative businesses taking many aspects of education online.\n\nOur role in the global energy transition\n\nMacquarie's role in driving the global energy transition is three-fold: scaling-up the development and deployment of technologies critical to delivering deep decarbonisation; supporting the adaption and transition of our clients, industries and assets; and assisting in the mobilisation of private capital for climate solutions in developing countries.\n\nSince our first project almost 20 years ago, we have evolved our approach from a focus on investing and developing individual assets to creating, acquiring, and partnering with specialist development businesses. By deploying our balance sheet in partnership with the specialist capabilities of our partners, we have been able to accelerate the rollout of mature technologies and establish and commercialise new ones.\n\nThis has seen us become a leader in the fast-growing wind and solar industries that form the basis of a decarbonised global energy system - developing, constructing, operating and financing over 50 GW of projects around the world - and expand our involvement in emerging technologies, with early-stage investments in utility scale storage, zero emission transport and hydrogen.\n\nWhile driving this important transition, we also recognise the need to replace jobs and reskill communities through a planned process. Macquarie businesses are also active in helping to address heightened levels of scarcity and volatility in global energy markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping clients and portfolio companies decarbonise\n\nThe global transition to net zero will be driven by consumers and companies taking action to reduce their carbon emissions.\n\nFor two decades we've used our deep capabilities in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, transportation, technology and commodities to work with clients and our portfolio businesses to create practical solutions to their decarbonisation challenges.\n\nAround the world, this means providing clients with ESG investment products, corporate advisory services, green power purchase agreements, risk and capital solutions for clean and renewable fuels, carbon offsetting products that are directing capital to vital under-funded climate projects, and asset finance in areas like transport fleet electrification, smart meters, and the circular economy.\n\nIn our asset management business, where we have sufficient influence we are working with our portfolio companies to develop business plans that set them on emissions reduction trajectories in line with a net zero economy by 2040 or sooner. In Australia, our retail banking and financial services business is supporting the rapid growth of electric vehicles with a specialist buying service.",

Achieving this requires partnership between the public and private sectors.\n\nThis year, we led important new initiatives on mobilising capital for the transition in emerging markets and developing economies through GFANZ and CFLI. We also joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in FY2022 and are working with banks worldwide to standardise the industry approach to setting targets for 2030 and align lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nOur own net zero plan is on track to be released by the end of 2022, and this will confirm our commitments to exit coal lending and equity by 2024 and reduce the carbon intensity of our limited oil and gas equity and lending positions. We were pleased to join the discussions with other leaders at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021 on working together to accelerate climate action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Catalysing meaningful social impact in our communities\n\nThe Macquarie Group Foundation plays a vital role in how Macquarie lives out its purpose, building on our strong staff-led approach to giving.\n\nThe Foundation is increasing the scale and impact of our grantmaking, which continues to support social and economic mobility and finding opportunities to partner with Macquarie's businesses to further social impact.\n\nFocusing on the communities where our people live and work enables a better understanding of local needs, and helps to leverage our staff time, expertise and networks for greater impact.\n\nIn support of communities and families across Ukraine, Macquarie staff and business groups donated a total of $A3.5 million, including Foundation matching, to organisations working to provide vital humanitarian support.\n\nA one-time $A20 million additional allocation was also made to the Macquarie Group Foundation to expand our Social Impact Investing program, which invests to generate positive, measurable social impact alongside a financial return. Macquarie also announced a first-of-its-kind initiative for unemployed people in the UK, the Green Jobs program, with catalytic funding provided by the Foundation.\n\nFor two decades we've used our deep capabilities in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, transportation, technology and commodities to work with clients and our portfolio businesses to create practical solutions to their decarbonisation challenges.'\n\n## Embedding ESG considerations across business decisions\n\nWe recognise that a robust approach to ESG considerations is beneficial to all our stakeholders, and is integral to our commitment to investing for a better future. ESG considerations are embedded in both our operational and investment decision-making, along with the asset management frameworks that inform how our portfolio companies assess and improve their performance.\n\nThe delivery of sustainable long-term value requires the allocation of capital and resources in a way that identifies and addresses unmet community need. Financial institutions play an essential role in taking risks to support communities and economic growth. For Macquarie, the appetite for such risk sits within a clear risk management framework which has enabled us to invest successfully across broad areas of sustainable development over many decades.\n\nMeanwhile, well-considered corporate governance is essential in promoting transparency and accountability and creating an environment of trust. Evolving governance expectations required of boards and companies are lifting the standards to which business must perform, and we strongly support this trajectory. Nonetheless, such obligations must also balance the ability to take necessary risks to achieve sound community outcomes and financial returns for investors. Macquarie's Board and Management continue to devote significant time to ensuring we achieve this balance across our business activities.",

The result was reflective of increased revenue across Commodities with strong risk management income from Gas and Power, Resources, Agriculture and Global Oil due to increased client hedging activity and trading activity as a result of elevated levels of volatility and commodity price movements. Commodities inventory management and trading income also increased with strong trading gains from supply and demand imbalances in Gas and Power partially offset by unfavourable timing of income recognition on Gas storage and transport contracts. Financial Markets continued to record strong performance across major products and markets. The result also benefited from an increased contribution from Asset Finance, largely related to the partial sale of the UK Meters portfolio in May 2021 and increased activity across its other sectors.\n\nCGM continues to be recognised across the industries it operates in, with a number of awards earned during the period including Oil and Products House of the Year, Natural Gas/LNG House of the Year and Derivatives House of the Year in the 2022 Energy Risk Awards and Base Metals, Commodity Research, Derivatives and Oil and Products House of the Year in the 2021 Energy Risk Asia Awards. CGM is ranked by Platts as No.4 physical gas marketer in North America.\n\n## Medium-term\n\nCGM remains focused on: opportunities to grow the commodities business, both organically and through acquisition; the development of institutional and corporate coverage for specialised credit, rates and foreign exchange products; providing tailored financing solutions globally across a variety of industries and asset classes; continued investment in the asset finance portfolio; supporting the client franchise as markets evolve, particularly as it relates to the energy transition and growing the client base across all regions.\n\nMacquarie Capital has global capability in advisory and capital raising services, investing alongside partners and clients across the capital structure, providing clients with specialist expertise, advice and flexible capital solutions across a range of sectors.\n\nIt also has global capability in development and investment in infrastructure and energy projects and companies, with a focus on transport, digital and social infrastructure.\n\nMacquarie Capital's Equities brokerage business provides clients with access to equity research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access.\n\n## FY2022 Highlights\n\nMacquarie Capital maintained its No. 1 global ranking for infrastructure financial adviser as well as No.1 in ANZ for M&A.\n\nMacquarie Capital acted as financial adviser to Sydney Aviation Alliance on its ~$A32 billion acquisition of Sydney Airport and as exclusive financial adviser to Scientific Games Corporation on its $US6.05 billion sale of its Lottery Business to Brookfield Business Partners.\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, the Principal Finance committed portfolio was over $A15 billion including $A13 billion credit portfolio, with record deployment during the financial year through focused investment in credit markets and bespoke financing solutions. Macquarie Capital provided more than 30 unitranche financings to clients, including to support Onex's acquisition of TES Global, a well-established international provider of comprehensive software solutions for the education sector.\n\nA Macquarie-led consortium, Bridging Pennsylvania Partners, has been selected by the Pennsylvania Department of Transport as Preferred Bidder for the $US2 billion Pathways Major Bridge P3 Initiative involving the design, build, financing, and maintenance of nine bridges in Pennsylvania, USA.\n\n## Medium-term\n\nMacquarie Capital continues to pursue opportunities for balance sheet investment alongside clients and project development in the infrastructure space.

Our purpose and principles and what we expect of our staff are set out in our Code of Conduct .\n\nThe balance between opportunity and accountability, while operating with integrity within a strong risk management framework, is a feature of Macquarie's success and a key factor in our long record of unbroken profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available at macquarie.com/wha t-we-stand-for\n\n## Our business strategy\n\nConsistent with the principles of What We Stand For , Macquarie's business strategy is focused on the medium-term with the following key aspects:\n\n## Risk management approach\n\nAdopting a conservative approach to risk management underpinned by a sound risk culture. Macquarie's robust risk management framework and risk culture are embedded across all Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\n## Strong balance sheet\n\nMaintaining a strong and conservative balance sheet.\n\nThis is consistent with Macquarie's longstanding policy of holding a level of capital that supports its business and managing its capital base ahead of ordinary business requirements.\n\nMacquarie has a liability driven approach to balance sheet management, where funding is raised prior to assets being taken on to the balance sheet.\n\nWe continue to pursue the strategy of diversifying funding sources by growing our deposit base and accessing wholesale funding across a variety of products and markets.\n\n## Business mix\n\nConducting a mix of annuity-style and markets-facing businesses that deliver consistent returns in a range of market conditions.\n\n## Diversification\n\nOperating a diversified set of businesses across different locations and service offerings: asset management and finance, banking, advisory and risk and capital solutions across debt, equity and commodities.\n\nMacquarie offers a range of services to government, institutional, corporate and retail clients. This diversity in services and clients mitigates concentration risk and provides resilience to Macquarie.\n\n## Proven expertise\n\nUtilising proven deep expertise has allowed Macquarie to establish leading market positions as a global specialist in sectors including renewables, infrastructure, resources and commodities, energy, financial institutions and real estate.\n\n## Adjacencies\n\nExpanding progressively by pursuing adjacencies through organic opportunities and selective acquisitions.\n\nThese include products and geographies adjacent to our established areas of expertise, supporting sustainable evolutionary growth.\n\n## Pursuit of growth opportunities\n\nTargeting continued evolution and growth through innovation. We start with knowledge and skill, and we encourage ingenuity and entrepreneurial spirit coupled with accountability.\n\nIdeas for new businesses are typically generated in the Operating Groups. Additionally, there are no specific businesses, markets or regions in which our strategy dictates that we operate. This means we retain operational flexibility and can adapt the portfolio mix to changing market conditions within the boundaries of the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) approved by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nMacquarie recognises that a sound risk culture is a fundamental requirement of an effective risk management framework.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nMacquarie's risk culture is well established, grounded in the long-held principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity.\n\nMacquarie's approach to maintaining an appropriate risk culture is based on the following three components:\n\n- \u00b7 leading and executing: Management implements behavioural expectations through leadership actions and communication, organisational governance, incentives and consequence management and organisational and individual capability\n- \u00b7 setting behavioural expectations: Senior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie's purpose is defined by our principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are specified in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through the organisation\n- \u00b7 monitoring, measuring and reporting: Macquarie monitors and measures its risk culture to gauge effectiveness while promoting continuous improvement.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is embedded across all operations. The framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, monitor, report and control or mitigate internal or external sources of material risk.\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG.\n\nDuring the year, Macquarie detected unauthorised trading activity by one individual in CGM and reported the issue promptly to all relevant regulators. While there have been no systemic issues identified and the impact is not material to CGM or MGL from a P&L perspective, there are learnings from the situation in relation to processes and enhancements to the control framework have been implemented. There were no client impacts from this issue.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to Risk Management in section 2 for details on Macquarie's risk management framework, risk culture and conduct risk management\n\n## Macroeconomic and other factors\n\nThe key macroeconomic risks to Macquarie's short and medium term financial outlook noted on page 28 are:\n\n## Market conditions\n\nThe general condition of markets, driven by both macroeconomic and geopolitical factors may have a bearing on Macquarie's businesses. Changing market conditions influence the volume and timing of client and principal transactions across businesses and the value of various equity, credit and market risk exposures held by Macquarie on its balance sheet.\n\n## The value of the Australian dollar\n\nA significant proportion of Macquarie's net income is denominated in foreign currency. Therefore, net income will be lower in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar appreciates against other foreign currencies, and net income will be higher in Australian dollar terms if the Australian dollar depreciates against other foreign currencies.\n\n## Potential regulatory changes\n\nMacquarie is affected by changes in regulation. Regulatory change continues to increase at both the global and Australian levels and has the potential to affect the regulatory capital and funding requirements and profitability of Macquarie's businesses.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nMacquarie uses deposits and debt markets, among other funding sources, to fund its assets. Macquarie is therefore exposed to the risk of an increase in the cost of funding, or of reduced access to funding sources.\n\nIn addition, there are specific material risks that relate to the nature of Macquarie's operations. Material risks are those that could have a material impact, financial or non-financial on Macquarie. These include aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social (including climate change), equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. These risks, including those mentioned above, are monitored, mitigated and managed under Macquarie's risk management framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the management of these risks are available at macquarie.com/ris k-management",

We believe that by empowering people we will achieve our shared potential.\n\nThe way we fulfil our purpose is defined by our principles of Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. These principles guide Board, management and staff conduct, and it is expected that they all meet these standards and deal honestly and fairly with our clients, counterparties and regulators. There are appropriate consequences for anyone who fails to meet our standards.\n\nThe balance between opportunity and accountability, while operating with integrity within a strong risk management framework, is a feature of Macquarie's success and a key factor in our long record of unbroken profitability. Our corporate governance practices reflect this balance.\n\n| Identify and realise opportunity  for clients, community,  shareholders and our people   | Promote the long-term  profitability of Macquarie while  prudently managing risk   | Drive superior and sustainable  shareholder value over  the long-term   | Meet stakeholder expectations  of sound corporate governance   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity                            | What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity                      | What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity           | What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity  |\n| Prudently managing risk                                                                  | Prudently managing risk                                                            | Prudently managing risk                                                 | Prudently managing risk                                        |\n| Align staff and shareholders' interests                                                  | Align staff and shareholders' interests                                            | Align staff and shareholders' interests                                 | Align staff and shareholders' interests                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe full Corporate Governance Statement (Statement) has been lodged with ASX and is available on our website at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance .

        "page_content": "## Board oversight\n\nThe Board sets the 'tone at the top' in a highly visible manner. Board members have broad contact with staff at various levels within the organisation and across regions.\n\nThere is a culture of open and frank discussion at the Board. Actions taken by the Board seek to promote long-term sustainability and prudent management of risk consistent with What We Stand For .\n\nIn FY2022 there were 44 formal Board and Board Committee meetings. At these meetings a total of approximately 660 items of business were presented by over 450 presenters who were not members of the Board or Macquarie's Executive Committees. Between formal meetings management provided the Board with material business and other updates as well as information in response to requests from Board members.\n\nWorkshops scheduled during FY2022 included presentations on cryptocurrency and blockchain, non-financial risk appetite metrics, regulatory engagement, ransomware, whistleblowing guidance, Macquarie's issue and incident management reporting system, conduct risk and environmental, social and governance practices.\n\nNon-executive Board members also met regularly without members of management and held private meetings with each of the external auditor, Head of Internal Audit and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) to assist with their oversight role.\n\nDuring FY2022, the Board continued to enable virtual attendance at Board and Board Committee meetings, workshops and meetings with management, as needed to respond to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nBoard members believe that informal conversations with staff are important in assessing the culture within Macquarie and seeing Macquarie's purpose at work. Board members generally attend various staff functions in Australia and conduct two overseas trips to Macquarie offices each year. Due to international travel restrictions in FY2022 and in the interests of health and safety, the Board held virtual visits with the US, EMEA and Asia offices. These visits helped to emulate the in-person experience for the Board with presentations from regional staff covering regional, group and strategy updates, topical issues in regions, people and culture and Macquarie's purpose statement in practice, and presentations from external speakers. Key highlights from the US office virtual Board visit included virtual small group break-out discussions among the Board and staff on diversity, equity and inclusion, wellbeing and evolving ways of working, and Macquarie's purpose statement in action in the Americas. In the EMEA virtual office visit, highlights included a virtual staff town hall and panel Q&A session where the Board could ask, and staff could submit, questions in real time to a panel of speakers. During these virtual visits the Board engaged with approximately 130 staff at all levels of seniority. Each visit brought together staff from various locations within the regions, increasing and enhancing the Board's opportunity for engagement with staff.\n\n## Professional Conduct\n\nMacquarie's culture, as represented by our long-held principles, may be summarised as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccountability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrity\n\nWe are entrepreneurial. Our people come from diverse backgrounds and are empowered to work together to pursue innovative ideas, to solve problems and challenge conventional thinking and the status quo. We work hard and with enthusiasm and everyone has the opportunity to achieve to their full potential. We have a learning and growth mindset, and continually evolve our expertise. We recognise and reward performance.\n\nWe take pride and ownership of the long-term outcomes we deliver for our clients and shareholders, our communities and each other. We manage risk to ensure these outcomes are sustainable and invest our time and capital to contribute to a better future. We take ownership of the performance of our endeavours and seek to quickly identify and respond to change, emerging issues and trends.\n\nWe operate with care and professionalism. We work collaboratively to amplify our impact and consider the effect of our decisions on others. We have the courage, and are encouraged, to speak up with our ideas, when we make a mistake or see something that doesn't seem right. We respect the law, community expectations, our regulators, shareholders, clients and customers and each other.\n\nThe Board oversees compliance with key policies that are intended to instil a culture of acting lawfully, ethically and responsibly. An overview of the key policies that apply to our staff, such as the Whistleblower Policy and Anti-bribery and Corruption Policy , is provided in Macquarie's Code of Conduct . Material incidents and breaches relating to those policies and the Code of Conduct are reported to the Board, typically through the relevant Board Committee.",

The Board is also assisted by the BAC, the BRC and the BGCC in its oversight of financial and non-financial risk.\n\nDuring each year, including the most recent year, the Board monitored the operation of Macquarie's risk management framework to satisfy itself that the framework continues to be sound and that Macquarie is operating with due regard to the risk appetite set by the Board.

The Board recognises that to achieve these objectives, we must attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise, align their interests with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers and ensure that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with the expectations of stakeholders.\n\nThe Board oversees Macquarie's remuneration framework.

In FY2022, the BAC determined to undertake a comprehensive review of the external auditor beginning in FY2024. The BAC at least annually recommends to the Board the continuation of, appointment of a new, or removal of the existing external auditor\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nMacquarie's Auditor Independence Policy requires BAC approval, or between meetings the approval of the BAC Chair for subsequent ratification by the BAC, for non-audit work performed by the external auditor if the proposed service falls outside the scope of pre-approved services or the proposed engagement fee exceeds the policy's local currency threshold.\n\nThe policy, which reflects Australian legal requirements, also requires that Macquarie's lead auditor and review auditor be rotated every five years unless the Board grants approval to extend the term for up to a further two years.\n\nMs Kristin Stubbins of PwC has been Macquarie's lead auditor since FY2020. She attended the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held during the reporting period and was available to answer questions about the conduct of the audit, and the preparation and content of the auditor's report.\n\nMacquarie's auditor provides a declaration to the BAC at the time of Macquarie's interim and year-end financial reports, that no prohibited non-audit services have been provided. The external auditor is also required to declare in their audit report that they are independent of MGL and its subsidiaries in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) that are relevant to its audit of the financial report in Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe BAC Charter and the External Auditor Policy Statement describe key aspects of Macquarie's Auditor Independence Policy and external auditor review process, and are available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\n## Review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor's performance\n\nThe BAC conducts an annual review of the quality and effectiveness of the external auditor, including qualifications, expertise, resources and performance of the external auditor, PwC. During FY2022, the BAC determined to implement a more detailed, comprehensive review of the external auditor which will be conducted at least every 5 years, beginning in FY2024, in addition to its annual external auditor review processes.\n\nThe annual evaluation involves assessing PwC's performance against ASIC's audit quality guidance, obtaining feedback from the Board and senior stakeholders across various Macquarie finance and business teams, and obtaining and reviewing feedback from PwC on the results of any internal or other external audit quality reviews relating to the audit. The comprehensive review will focus on the performance of the audit firm over several years - both at Macquarie and as a firm in servicing its clients, its industry expertise, application of professional scepticism, internal quality processes and independence processes. This enhanced periodic review strengthens the governance framework for the external auditor and helps manage risks relating to the auditor's independence and effectiveness, which may include the risk of institutional familiarity arising from the external auditor's tenure.\n\nA written report summarising the results of the annual and comprehensive (as applicable) review and feedback from the Board and senior stakeholders across Macquarie finance and business teams, is presented to, and discussed at, a BAC meeting and separately discussed with PwC.\n\nBased on the results of this year's annual performance and independence reviews, in May 2022 the BAC recommended to the Board that PwC continue in its role as Macquarie's external auditor.",

Macquarie engages with institutional investors, private investors, sell-side analysts and buy-side analysts throughout the year via scheduled and ad hoc interactions.\n\nAs part of Macquarie's commitment to keep its investor base informed, management presents at various investment conferences and conducts investor visits and meetings (including virtual) throughout the year. All material investor or analyst presentations are lodged with ASX ahead of the presentation and made available on Macquarie's website.\n\nPeriodic corporate reports that are not audited or reviewed by PwC are verified internally by management prior to release to ASX. The verification process allocates material disclosures within the relevant document to designated persons to substantiate the disclosures by reference to company source documents or, if no source documents are available, by persons with the knowledge and expertise to confirm the accuracy and completeness of the disclosures.\n\n## Macquarie's website\n\nRecent announcements, past and current reports to shareholders, including summaries of key financial data, operational briefing presentations, AGM webcasts and copies of recent notices of meeting are available on the investor centre page of our website. Investor Relations contacts are also available on our website.\n\nShareholders can elect to receive communications from, and send communications to, MGL and MGL's share registry electronically by visiting the investor contacts page on Macquarie's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about Macquarie is available at mac quarie.com\n\n## Shareholder meetings\n\nMGL encourages shareholders to participate in general meetings and aims to choose a date, time and venue convenient to its shareholders. For shareholders who are unable to attend in person, MGL provides a webcast of its AGM and any other general meetings. The results of all resolutions are lodged with ASX as soon as they are available after the meeting.\n\nMGL typically holds its AGM in July each year.\n\nNotices of meeting are accompanied by explanatory notes on the items of business and together they seek to clearly explain the nature of business of the meeting.\n\nIf shareholders are unable to attend the meeting, they are encouraged to vote on the proposed motions by appointing a proxy. The proxy form included with a notice of meeting explains how to appoint a proxy. Online proxy voting is also available to shareholders.\n\nUnless specifically stated in a notice of meeting, all holders of fully paid ordinary shares are eligible to vote on all resolutions. MGL's practice is that voting on each proposed resolution is conducted by poll.\n\nMGL seeks to conduct its shareholder meetings in a courteous manner for those attending. In the interests of attending shareholders, the chair of the meeting will exercise their powers as the chair to ensure that the meeting is conducted in an orderly and timely fashion.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Macquarie decided in the interests of the health and safety of shareholders, staff and other stakeholders, to hold MGL's 2021 AGM largely as an online meeting. Shareholders were provided with various alternatives to participate in the AGM, including by watching the AGM live through a facility that enabled shareholders to vote and to ask questions or make comments online and a dial-in teleconference to listen to the meeting live and to ask questions on the telephone but not vote.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA shareholder calendar is available at macquarie.com /investors\n\nThe Corporate Governance Statement is current as at 5 May 2022 and has been approved by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Corporate Governance Statement and Key to Disclosures (Appendix 4G) have been lodged with ASX and are available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance",

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are business priorities and remain fundamental to Macquarie's success. Creating an inclusive culture is a shared responsibility with everyone, from our most senior leaders to our newest employees, accountable for ensuring that people can be their authentic selves and reach their full potential.\n\nIn FY2022, we reaffirmed our commitment to building a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we operate. We elevated equity in our strategy and enhanced our internal metrics for measuring progress. Our leadership teams in each Operating and Central Service Group and region have developed DEI strategies to realise tangible results aligned to our Workforce Diversity Policy. Progress towards achieving Macquarie's FY2022 DEI objectives is disclosed in this report.\n\nMacquarie is committed to:\n\n- \u00b7 fostering a workplace where our people feel respected for their uniqueness, valued for their contribution and supported to perform at their best\n- \u00b7 continue building a workforce that reflects all aspects of diversity to bring a range of perspectives, ideas and insights to everything we do\n- \u00b7 championing equity for people from under-represented groups by removing barriers, valuing and accommodating for differences so more people are included and reach their full potential.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's Workforce Diversity Policy is available at macquarie.com/diversit y-equity-and-inclusion\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion objectives\n\nAccountability and transparency are critical to DEI progress. The Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) monitors the diversity, equity and inclusion objectives and progress of each group and region. The Workforce Diversity Policy provides that each year the BRC will set measurable objectives for increasing the diversity of Macquarie's workforce and maintaining a culture of respect and inclusion.\n\nOur DEI objectives reflect the commitment to action across our organisation. Every employee is responsible for creating a respectful and inclusive culture and valuing the diverse ideas and perspectives of others. Management Committees globally, in each Operating and Central Service Group and region, are accountable for achieving Macquarie's DEI objectives. The Board and BRC receive regular updates on progress against Macquarie's DEI commitments and challenge our leaders to do better.\n\nMacquarie's BRC has endorsed the FY2022 DEI objectives as set out below.\n\n## Our diverse people\n\nMacquarie is committed to building a workforce that reflects all aspects of diversity and intersectionality to bring a range of perspectives, ideas and insights to everything we do. Our focus continues to be on developing the internal and external pipeline of people from under-represented groups at all levels and enhancing our recruitment and talent practices to facilitate this. Macquarie's objectives are:\n\n## Workforce composition:\n\n- \u00b7 increase representation of women and under-represented ethnic groups at the senior leadership levels of Executive Committee, Division Head and Senior Executive\n- \u00b7 increase representation of women and under-represented ethnic groups across our workforce\n- \u00b7 increase diversity of our Board of Directors, including always having at least 30% female representation\n- \u00b7 maintain gender balance and increase ethnic diversity on Intern and Graduate programs.\n\n## Diversity practices:\n\n- \u00b7 evolve practices to attract candidates with broad inherent diversity and acquired diversity\n- \u00b7 internal campaign to enhance the collection of demographic data to understand the diversity of our workforce\n- \u00b7 require diverse representation on all recruitment shortlists and interview panels and ask 'if not, why not?'\n- \u00b7 maintain high return-to-work and retention rates for employees following parental leave\n- \u00b7 hire experienced candidates from groups that are under-represented in Macquarie to diversify our workforce at all levels\n- \u00b7 maximise retention of people from under-represented groups through targeted support.\n\n## Progress in FY2022\n\nWe recognise that our people have multiple, intersecting identities. In FY2022 we gave our people the opportunity to self-identify across a broader range of diversity dimensions including cultural and racial diversity, disability, gender identity, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+), and parenting and caring roles. This data will enable internal and external benchmarking, as well as measurement of progress over time.",

Female representation on the Macquarie Group Board of Directors has increased to 50% and the Executive Committee to 30%.\n\nWhile additional improvements are still necessary, Female representation has increased year-on-year across Macquarie's total workforce, and in the senior executive and division head population.\n\nTable 1: Global female representation by level over five years\n\n| As at 31 March       |   2018 % |   2019 % |   2020 % |   2021 % |   2022 % |\n|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Board of Directors   |     30   |     36.4 |     36.4 |     45.5 |     50   |\n| Executive Committee  |     25   |     25   |     27.3 |     27.3 |     30   |\n| Division Head (1)    |     23.5 |     23.9 |     24.6 |     23   |     26.5 |\n| Senior Executive (2) |     17.2 |     19.1 |     19.9 |     20.5 |     21.8 |\n| Macquarie Workforce  |     39.8 |     40.1 |     41   |     42   |     43   |\n\nOver 81% of permanent roles filled globally during FY2022 had at least one female candidate on the shortlist and one or more female Macquarie staff on the interview panel. Macquarie maintained gender balanced Intern and Graduate programs and women continue to be hired in greater proportion than the underlying application rate. Female and male turnover have remained comparable.\n\nTo address representation in the long-term pipeline, we continue to encourage young women to explore a career in financial services by highlighting the exciting career opportunities available and connecting them with role models across Macquarie's business groups. Adjusted for a virtual environment, programs include our Empowering Women in Finance & Tech in Australia, the Female Business Series in the UK and Australia, Girls Go Tech program in Hong Kong and NavGurukul in India.\n\nWe met our UK Women in Finance Charter female representation objective in January 2022, 18 months ahead of schedule. In India, Macquarie ranked in the top 100 Best Companies for Women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Families and carers\n\nMacquarie continues to provide support to working parents of all genders and those with carer's responsibilities through flexibility, paid leave and initiatives such as backup child, adult and eldercare, parent facilities, and return-to-work coaching for parents and their managers.\n\nIn ANZ, Macquarie was accredited as a Family Friendly Workplace and received a National Level 2 carer accreditation from Carers+Employers, recognised for our deep commitment to supporting the careers of carers.\n\nMacquarie's global return to work rate was 96% in FY2022 and high retention rates continue to be achieved for staff who have taken parental leave.\n\n## Cultural diversity and racial equity\n\nAs a global organisation, we acknowledge the importance, necessity and benefit of cultural diversity and racial equity in the workforce. Macquarie has continued to accelerate initiatives to ensure we are building an organisation that takes real steps towards racial equity and full inclusion for all colleagues.\n\nWe continue to invest in internship and recruitment channels that expand our reach and better connect with talent from under-represented racial groups. In the U.S., Macquarie continued to partner with Jopwell, Seizing Every Opportunity, and BLK Capital Management. In Australia, the CareerTrackers and CareerSeekers programs placed 50 students in paid internships during FY2022. In EMEA, we were recognised as a Top 10 Outstanding Employer at the UK Ethnicity awards for our actions taken to drive the ethnicity agenda.\n\nRecognising each of the regions in which we operate is unique, we take an active and localised approach to drive change in our business and communities. In FY2022, Macquarie launched sponsorship programs to support directors from under-represented groups and held focus groups to understand the unique experiences of our colleagues of colour. The $US5 million multi-year Racial Equity Fund continued to support community groups working to promote racial equity in the US.\n\nCultural awareness and race fluency training programs and events took place across our regions, facilitating awareness and allyship tailored to cultural elements within our specific markets. Our multicultural Employee Network Groups (ENGs), made up of members and allies, continue to play an active role in connecting and empowering colleagues of different races, ethnicities and cultures.",

Macquarie achieved #1 ranking in the UK Stonewall Workplace Equality Index, Platinum Employer status in the Australian Workplace Equality Index Awards and a 100 score for the fourth consecutive year on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index in the US. In Asia, Macquarie was named a Silver Employer in India's Workplace Equality Index and in Japan's PRIDE Index. We were also selected as a top 10 employer by the British LGBT Awards. Such awards recognise our focus on LGBTQ+ inclusion at every stage for employees, including through policies, benefits, training and leadership engagement.\n\nIn 2021 we enabled our staff to self-identify as gender diverse, released global gender affirmation guidelines for staff and managers, expanded our educational resources and created safe spaces for women who identify as LGBTQ+ to virtually connect across the globe.\n\nMacquarie's Pride ENG chapters continued to provide strong and active communities for LGBTQ+ people and their allies, celebrating our progress and championing inclusion across our businesses.\n\n## People who are neurodiverse or living with disabilities\n\nMacquarie is a member of The Valuable 500, a global collective focused on disability inclusion. We highlighted the importance of accessibility in the Macquarie Technology Summit to encourage staff, clients and the broader community to create inclusive products and services that benefit everyone. We continue to design for accessibility and provide adjustments to working arrangements to meet the unique needs of candidates and employees who are living with disabilities. Principles of inclusive design are embedded within our eLearning standards, and event guidelines and inclusive design resources are available to all staff. Accessible technology tools and features continue to be embraced as we work in a hybrid working environment.\n\nIn EMEA, in addition to rolling out neurodiversity training to all people managers, we launched a new neurodiversity focused ENG - Spark.\n\nAccessibility is a strategic imperative across our digital communication channels. Macquarie's website aims to conform with WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility criteria and teams who oversee this platform complete mandatory Web Accessibility training.\n\n## Our inclusive culture\n\nCreating a workplace where our people feel respected for their uniqueness, valued for their contribution and empowered to reach their full potential is essential for diversity of thought to flourish. We are embedding inclusion and psychological safety in our culture through day-to-day practices (behavioural inclusion), programs and policies (structural inclusion). Macquarie's objectives are:\n\n## Behavioural inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 further promote psychological safety, and respectful and inclusive behaviour through awareness and education activities\n- \u00b7 continue developing inclusive leadership capabilities of our managers and leaders\n- \u00b7 encourage flexible working in all its forms\n- \u00b7 foster a culture of natural sponsorship of people from under-represented groups to create pathways to senior management.\n\n## Structural inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 monitor the equity of people decisions, holding senior managers accountable for inclusive practices\n- \u00b7 continue to equip senior managers with data to understand the diversity of their teams and assess the inclusiveness of their practices\n- \u00b7 empower staff to work flexibly in ways that suit their own roles, the needs of their teams, and their personal lives\n- \u00b7 further embed the principles of DEI in all people-related policies, processes and programs to ensure the highest and fairest standards:\n- - maintain pay equity for like roles and performance\n- - provide equal access to opportunities and future skilling\n- - maintain equality for people of all genders and ethnicities in promotion decisions\n- - provide staff with access to flexible working.\n\n## Progress in FY2022\n\nWith the majority of staff working remotely in FY2022, Macquarie continued to focus on maintaining an inclusive virtual working environment. In our 2021 staff survey, 96% of staff feel that our people listen to, learn from and act on the diverse perspectives of their colleagues.\n\nThe Inclusive Leadership: Directors Masterclass series was released in 2021 to create active and visible allies, promoting a stronger sense of belonging for all our people. To date, over 1,600 directors across the Americas, Asia and ANZ attended sessions on Covering, Allyship and Inclusion Moments that Matter.\n\nWhilst flexible working has long been part of Macquarie's working practice, the COVID-19 environment has enhanced the ways in which we connect with each other. Macquarie has adopted hybrid working as part of the evolving culture of work and continues to empower our people to manage their work and time to achieve their career and personal goals. 93% of staff say they have the technology and tools they need to do their job well in a remote working environment.",

Their focus spans culture and heritage, First Nations, gender balance, LGBTQ+, race and ethnicity, families, neurodiversity and military veterans. These groups amplify the voices of under-represented people and provide staff with opportunities to exchange ideas, build relationships and support Macquarie's DEI strategy.\n\n## Inclusive and equitable practices\n\nThe principles of equity and inclusion are embedded in Macquarie's people practices and processes, including core talent programs, recruitment processes, remuneration and promotion criteria. In FY2022 we elevated the focus on equity and we are comprehensively reviewing our processes as part of our talent transformation.\n\nMacquarie continues to embed equity in everything we do to promote fairness of outcomes. We focus on creating opportunities for all staff to demonstrate skills and capability and their promotion-readiness; and ensuring we support staff from under-represented groups through the critical midcareer levels and into senior roles.\n\nWorkforce data is regularly analysed and provided to senior managers so they may assess the equity of people decisions, the inclusiveness of practices in their teams and to identify where additional action is needed. Senior managers are also held accountable for achieving inclusion objectives. In FY2022:\n\n- \u00b7 promotion decisions and outcomes were reviewed and analysed to identify any gender discrepancies. Promotion rates of males and females to Director levels have remained comparable\n- \u00b7 remuneration outcomes were reviewed to ensure pay equity for like roles and performance across all Operating and Central Service Groups and regions. No significant differences in remuneration outcomes were found to exist between males and females for like roles and performance\n- \u00b7 analyses were provided to senior leadership on the cultural background of promotion candidates.\n\n## Our clients and community\n\nMacquarie is committed to providing and supporting commercial and development opportunities for under-represented people in our community. We have long-term funding partnerships with non-profit organisations around the globe and our staff participate in a variety of activities including literacy and employability coaching, and mentoring. We are proud of the awards we have received this year and are committed to doing more to provide opportunities to under-represented people in our communities. Macquarie's objectives are to:\n\n- \u00b7 increase opportunities in our supply chain for businesses that have been historically under-represented in our communities or those driven by a social purpose\n- \u00b7 continue to tailor the delivery of our services to meet the needs of our diverse client base\n- \u00b7 further support the progress of under-represented groups through partnerships and sponsorships with organisations in the diversity sector\n- \u00b7 participate in additional DEI benchmarking indexes to identify opportunities for improvement.\n- \u00b7 promote finance and technology careers to secondary and tertiary students from under-represented groups to increase the diversity of the finance industry\n\n## Progress in FY2022\n\nMacquarie is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace for its own staff and seeks to instill this commitment within its assets under management when possible. For example, the MAM Real Assets business is focused on progressing DEI initiatives at the asset level and equipping its portfolio board directors and portfolio company leaders with resources and training to foster an inclusive environment and set measurable diversity objectives.\n\nAs part of our sustainable procurement strategy, Macquarie includes sustainability and supplier diversity requirements within tender documents. In FY2022, Macquarie spent over $A16.5 million with minority-owned businesses in our tier one and tier two supply chain. (3)\n\nThe Macquarie Group Foundation (Foundation) provides support to hundreds of community organisations globally each year through financial support, volunteering and skills sharing, predominantly in the locations in which Macquarie operates. The Foundation's work focuses on capacity building within the community sector and increasing social and economic mobility of underrepresented groups. The Macquarie Americas Racial Equity Fund (REF) supports non-profit organisations advancing solutions that promote a more equitable and just society for all people. In FY2022, the Americas Management Committee and the Foundation increased its funding from a $US1 million fund over a 3-year period to a $US5 million fund over five years to support direct relief programs, research and policy, and education and economic equity initiatives.",

Assessing and managing Macquarie-wide ESG risks is a key business priority and an important component of our broader risk management framework, detailed in the Risk Management section of this Annual Report.\n\nUnder the Code of Conduct all staff share responsibility for identifying and managing environmental and social issues as part of normal business practice. Staff are supported by the ESR team.\n\nThe ESR team coordinates a diverse range of ESG activities across business groups and regions, including developing and implementing Macquarie-wide and business-specific policies, reviewing transactions, providing advice on ESG risks and opportunities and facilitating training. The ESR team regularly reports to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and to the BGCC on ESG-related matters.\n\n## ESR in transactions\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are managed through the implementation of the ESR and Work Health and Safety (WHS) policies, which are based on international standards. (8) These are updated periodically to address opportunities for improvement and emerging issues.\n\nMacquarie's ESR Policy describes our approach to ESR management when onboarding or reviewing clients and other counterparties and across a broad range of transactions including equity investments, financing, leasing and advisory mandates. The ESR Policy provides a robust process to assess, manage, mitigate, monitor and report environmental and social risks and takes a precautionary approach to ESR issues including labour and employment practices, climate change, human rights, resource efficiency, pollution prevention, biodiversity and cultural heritage. Based on international guidelines, including the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, the ESR Policy provides escalated decision-making and approval processes, alongside the credit approval process, for material environmental and social risks.

The portfolio company board oversees the management of WHS. In FY2022, 140 Macquarie Nominee Directors received WHS governance training. Portfolio companies regularly monitor and report on WHS performance and risk management to Macquarie, including outcomes of incident investigations where there was a fatality or serious injury, or the potential for a fatality or serious injury.\n\nDuring FY2022, there has been a strong focus on regularly discussing WHS best practices and sharing of lessons learnt across our regions and Operating Groups. 23 safety alerts were shared across our business.\n\nMacquarie has a framework of polices and processes in place to identify and mitigate potential and actual human rights, including modern slavery, impacts resulting from our business activities and the relationships connected to those activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMacquarie's modern slavery and human trafficking statement prepared under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) can be downloaded from macquar ie.com/esg\n\n(11) Lost time Injury (LTI) is an incident that results in time lost from work equal to or greater than a full day/shift.

        "page_content": "## Environmental, Social and Governance\n\nContinued\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change is one of the most complex and critical challenges facing the world. Meeting the goals set out in the Paris Agreement requires the private and public sectors to work together to deliver the transition to a low-carbon future at unprecedented scale and pace, and in a socially inclusive manner. Macquarie is committed to playing a leading role in driving this global transition to net zero.\n\nFor two decades, we have used our deep capabilities in energy, infrastructure, transportation, technology, agriculture and commodities to work with clients to deliver practical climate solutions. Our approach to driving climate action is founded on five key areas.\n\n## Developing and investing in green energy\n\nInvesting and deploying green energy is at the core of our contribution to the net zero transition. Macquarie is committed to growing renewable energy capacity and is already developing, constructing, operating and financing over 50 GW of green energy projects around the world.\n\nOur Green Investment Group (GIG) has more than 250 green energy projects in development or construction (either directly or through operating platforms) totalling over 30 GW of predominantly solar and wind projects. FY2022 was a landmark year, as GIG further established capabilities in the development of new clean technologies like floating offshore wind, utility scale storage and hydrogen, all of which will play a critical role in enabling deep decarbonisation.\n\nOverall, Macquarie has invested and arranged $A2.3 billion into green energy projects in the past five years alone. While some of the investments are no longer on our balance sheet they continue to generate green energy every year, and will continue to do so well into the future.\n\n## Creating climate resilient infrastructure\n\nAs the world's largest infrastructure manager and a major developer of new greenfield infrastructure, our focus on climate resilience and adaptation is helping prepare communities for a changing world.\n\nWith over 160 portfolio companies, 530 properties and 4.7 million hectares of farmland in its global portfolio, Macquarie Asset Management (MAM) is investing in climate-specific risk assessments, revised operating procedures, physical enhancements, industrial technologies, and training, all of which contribute to greater climate resilience.\n\nMacquarie Capital is also designing climate resilience into new infrastructure projects from the start, to deal with a higher frequency of extreme weather events and rising sea levels.\n\n## Enabling the decarbonisation of our customers, clients and portfolio companies\n\nThere is broad societal consensus on the need to decarbonise, the goals that the world needs to reach, and the steps needed to get there. As a result, we are increasing our efforts, working with our customers, clients and portfolio companies to help them take action to decarbonise their activities. Macquarie is committed to continued expansion of our capabilities to help clients and customers navigate the transition to net zero. Building on our track record in renewables financial advisory and in helping businesses procure clean energy for their operations, we have developed financing and risk management solutions in areas including batteries, renewable fuels and clean transportation, and built a dedicated team that helps companies enhance their sustainability commitments with carbon offsets.\n\n## Aligning our activities to net zero\n\nIn 2021, Macquarie made a commitment to align its business operations and financing activities with the objective of enabling and accelerating the world's pathway to net zero by 2050.\n\nLast year, we established a dedicated cross-group Net Zero Program team to assess our lending and equity clients' existing climate footprint, and we are on track to release our first net zero plan by the end of 2022. Granular analysis of our exposures within the oil, gas and coal sectors is well progressed. Our initial work has highlighted significant data challenges, with many clients unable to provide estimates of their emissions. Given the gaps, and to ensure appropriate quality, we are augmenting our analysis with estimates using industry standards such as the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials to guide our approach.\n\nWe recognise that the availability and robustness of emissions data continues to evolve and have sought to establish approaches that can be adjusted over time as more companies compile and report their emissions footprint. We welcome moves by regulators to increase transparency with regard to company level emissions. These initiatives are likely to see data availability and quality improve materially in coming years.\n\nDetailed analysis is also underway to assess the emissions associated with our retail vehicle lending portfolio, focused on the vehicle make, model and estimated distance travelled.\n\nOver the coming months, we will continue to evolve this in-depth analysis to support the establishment of interim and long-term science-based goals for these sectors. This is in addition to our existing commitment on coal, where we expect our limited remaining equity and lending exposures to run off by 2024. We will expand the analysis to further sectors in 2023.",

        "page_content": "In addition, GIG also committed to achieving net zero emissions from financing activities associated with renewable energy generation projects by 2030, while MAM committed to invest and manage its portfolio in line with global net zero by 2040. During FY2022, MAM has been working with its portfolio companies to report and verify their emissions, set targets for emissions reduction, and develop business plans that contribute to a net zero economy by 2040 or sooner.\n\nTo accelerate our efforts, effective 1 April 2022, GIG has moved to operate as part of MAM. The need for investment in the energy transition continues to grow substantially. The combined teams will significantly enhance Macquarie's capacity to mobilise institutional capital for the transition and provide greater scale of decarbonisation solutions for clients, portfolio companies, communities, and the environment.\n\n## Working in partnership to raise ambition\n\nAcross the world, we work in close partnerships with stakeholders in the public and private sectors to raise ambitions on achieving global climate targets.\n\nThese partnerships take different forms, focusing on the many challenges ahead - including accelerating the deployment of mature technologies, driving the commercialisation of emerging climate solutions and technologies, mobilising capital to support the transition of emerging markets and developing countries, or rapidly scaling up investment in adaptation.\n\n## FY2022 energy sector exposures\n\n$A6.40 invested in renewable energy for every $A1 invested in conventional energy as at 31 March 2022. (12)\n\nIn supporting clients and economies through a managed transition, we note that significantly increased investment is required in renewables for the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Macquarie has played a leading role in increased deployment of renewables and the wider decarbonisation of the global economy.\n\nWe are working on several industry-led UN-convened projects to accelerate the transition to a net zero economy. Macquarie's CEO, Shemara Wikramanayake, sits on the CEO Principals Group of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and is leading a workstream to mobilise private capital for the transition in emerging markets. Our efforts in finding solutions for emerging markets are complemented through our role in co-chairing the Climate Finance Leadership Initiative's India country pilot with the Tata Group. We are signatories of the UN-convened Net Zero Asset Managers initiative and Net Zero Banking Alliance. Macquarie is also a member of His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales' Sustainable Markets Initiative and the Global Commission on Adaptation.\n\n## Climate-related financial disclosures\n\nMacquarie continues to support the important work of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and is actively implementing its recommendations.\n\nIn July 2021, we published a detailed report outlining our progress towards TCFD implementation. The report provides details of the transition and physical risk scenario analysis that was completed in 2021, including:\n\n- \u00b7 vulnerability and resilience of our business premises to physical climate risks.\n- \u00b7 physical risk analysis of prototypical equity investments, representing pathways to 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C warming by 2100\n\nParticular focus was placed on trying to address the various challenges that remain to full transition including energy storage, land use, the need for a greater number of investible projects and greater levels of investment in adaptation and resilience projects. In FY2022 these efforts continued globally, see pages 52 to 59 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Macquarie's equity and loan portfolio exposures to the oil, gas, coal and renewables sectors as at 31 March: (13)\n\nFY21\n\nFY22\n\n|                   |                  |                         |                         |                         |                  | Equity investments (12)   | Equity investments (12)   | Equity investments (12)   |\n|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                   | Loan assets (14) | Equity investments (12) | Equity investments (12) | Equity investments (12) | Loan assets (14) |                           |                           |                           |\n|                   | Loan assets (14) | Non-consolidated        | Consolidated $Ab        | Total $Ab               | $Ab              | Non-consolidated          | Consolidated              | Total                     |\n|                   | $Ab              | $Ab                     |                         |                         |                  | $Ab                       | $Ab                       | $Ab                       |\n| Oil               | 0.3              | 0.1                     | <0.1                    | 0.1                     | 0.2              | 0.1                       | <0.1                      | 0.1                       |\n| Gas               | 0.2              | <0.1                    | 0.1                     | 0.1                     | 0.2              | <0.1                      | 0.2                       | 0.2                       |\n| Coal              | 0.1              | <0.1                    | <0.1                    | <0.1                    | <0.1             | <0.1                      | <0.1                      | <0.1                      |\n| Renewable  energy | <0.1             | 0.6                     | 0.7                     | 1.3                     | <0.1             | 0.9                       | 0.7                       | 1.6                       |",

This year, our analysis is focusing on the physical risks of Macquarie's Australian residential real estate lending portfolio and the transition risks of parts of Macquarie's Australian business lending and residential real estate lending portfolios, as part of APRA's Climate Vulnerability Assessment. In carrying out this assessment, we are also performing more detailed assessments of selected counterparties, and balance sheet projections over a 30-year timeframe.\n\nIn addition, we have undertaken preliminary work to understand the risks associated with the commodity trading activities within our European regulated entity.\n\nThe capabilities developed through these activities support us in evolving our understanding of climate risk and integration into existing stress testing activities.\n\nThis section includes a summary of our climate-related disclosures. A more detailed report will be published with our net zero plan by the end of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information is available in our TCFD report which can be downloaded from macquar ie.com/esg\n\nMore detailed information on our approach to climate change is also available at macquar ie.com/esg\n\n## Our work in action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupporting renewable energy projects globally\n\nMaking sustainable choices more affordable\n\n## Investing in renewable energy\n\nOver the past year, our GIG business' operationally segregated subsidiaries (OSS) have been supporting solar projects across Europe, with projects in Greece, Italy, the UK and France. In Asia, our OSS Blueleaf Energy is developing solar and onshore wind projects in Japan, Taiwan, India, the Philippines and other markets in Southeast Asia.\n\nGIG has continued to build out its offshore wind portfolio by securing opportunities in development projects off the coasts of Scotland, Sweden and Ireland, and establishing partnerships to bid for offshore wind projects in France and Norway. GIG recently launched Corio Generation, its new dedicated offshore wind business, which will take that portfolio forward. Together with TotalEnergies, GIG has obtained an electricity business licence for its floating offshore wind project located off the coast of Ulsan, Korea. With a maximum installed capacity of 1.5 GW the project is one of the largest floating offshore wind developments in the world and aims to help deliver the Korean government's 'Green New Deal', revitalise local economies and support high-skilled employment opportunities.\n\nIn January 2022, another of GIG's joint ventures successfully secured the rights to develop the 2 GW West of Orkney Windfarm project off the coast of Scotland. As part of this development, the partners will unlock a \u00a3140m initiative to support the development of the local supply chain to actively promote employment and innovation in the region. Once built, the windfarm could also deliver renewable power to the Flotta Hydrogen Hub, a proposed large-scale green hydrogen production facility in Orkney, Scotland.\n\nThe International Energy Agency suggests the use of hydrogen will need to double over the course of this decade to meet net zero. To help meet this demand, we are working to advance a number of projects with partners globally. This includes feasibility studies into the production of green hydrogen in Orkney, Scotland, the Port of Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia and the Port of Southampton in the UK.\n\nTogether with Nobian, GIG has formed the Hydrogen Chemistry Company (HyCC), a company focused on producing green hydrogen from renewable power at an industrial scale. This includes a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The deal will allow HyCC to grow this pipeline and expand further into the European market.\n\nIn FY2022, Macquarie Capital also launched Aerogy, a platform that develops, operates and invests in renewable natural gas infrastructure projects that convert waste into low-carbon energy.\n\nWith greater electrification, and a growing share of renewables in generation, comes a greater need for system flexibility through technologies like battery storage. In June 2021, GIG acquired its first utility-scale battery storage development portfolio. We are now working to co-develop that portfolio of projects, which are strategically located across congested areas of the UK grid network. In late 2021, GIG entered a partnership to deliver Australia's largest privately funded and owned utility-scale battery. The project is fully committed and will connect to existing network infrastructure to support the transition to renewable energy at the site of the former Hazelwood Power Station in the Latrobe Valley, Victoria.\n\n## Driving transport decarbonisation\n\nIn recognition of our role to make sustainable choices more affordable for households, Macquarie is the first Australian banking group to provide a specialised electric vehicle buying service, Macquarie Vehicle Select, that supports customers transitioning to an electric vehicle. In addition to helping navigate the electric vehicle landscape in Australia, customers financing a new electric vehicle through Macquarie will access a discounted, car loan which has a lower interest rate than what is offered for internal combustion engine vehicles. Although Macquarie's direct car business remains a small part of its overall car loan portfolio, the business directly financed more EVs than ICE vehicles in the six months to 31 March 2022 and expects this trend to continue over the coming years.\n\nAs EV adoption rises, significant investment is needed to accelerate the roll-out of charging infrastructure. To support this, GIG has partnered with Heliox to create one of the first 'charging-as-a-service' offerings for fleet electrification in Europe.\n\nBy constructing and maintaining charging facilities on behalf of our customers, the service removes up-front costs whilst providing assurance around the design, operations and maintenance of the facilities, hence reducing the main barriers to fleet electrification. At the same time, MAM has invested in Roadchef, one of the UK's largest motorway service area operators. MAM has committed to develop and accelerate the rollout of fast-charging infrastructure for EVs at its 30 locations across the UK motorway network.\n\nIn the US, our Commodities and Global Markets (CGM) business is part of a consortium that was awarded grant funding by the California Air Resources Board and the California Energy Commission's Clean Transportation Program to deliver 30 XCIENT Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks and the associated refuelling infrastructure in California. The advancement of the transition to zero emissions in this region marks an important milestone for the business as they look to progress similar zero emission vehicle rollouts across the commercial transportation sector in the future.",

This year, we rolled out sector specific ESG scores for our coverage of approximately 800 companies across 11 Asian markets. Our scoring system layers analysts' impressions of covered companies on top of a rich set of company-reported and third-party data. We provide more context for the scores and company-level ESG performance through sector thematic reports and investor calls on a wide range of topics, from labour rights in Malaysia, to green steel in India, fossil fuel divestment in Japan to EV supply chains in China, and many more.\n\n## Trading\n\nOur CGM business provides risk management and trading solutions to support clients' varying energy transition needs.\n\nWe provide wholesale energy market access and hedging for a wide range of green energy suppliers, retailers and producers, such as waste-to-energy and biomass power plants.\n\nWe also provide access for corporations, including those operating in hard-to-abate sectors, to both voluntary and compliance global carbon markets to help manage their emission-related risks and achieve their climate goals. Our Global Carbon business, launched in 2021, builds on our voluntary carbon and wider commodity market expertise to provide a range of carbon offsetting solutions. As part of this, the business is developing a portfolio of high-quality offset projects that can be brought to market. For example, together with C-Quest Capital and partners, we have developed a sub-Saharan Africa cookstove program that is expected to result in the abatement of more than 220 million tonnes of carbon over the next 10 years, which are jointly marketed by Macquarie and C-Quest Capital. The program will distribute cookstoves to approximately 3.7 million households, not only providing verified emissions reductions, but also meaningful social and health improvements in these communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore detailed information is available at macquarie.com/esg and mirafunds.com/sust ainability",

Exacerbated by climate change, biodiversity loss is accelerating globally. We are evolving our approaches to consider biodiversity and climate change in our investment activities.\n\nAs a major agriculture investment manager, MAM is implementing a range of sustainable farm management practices across its portfolio to promote biodiversity, conservation and carbon capture. In FY2022, a MAM-managed fund registered two new environmental planting projects under the Australian Federal Government's Carbon + Biodiversity Pilot initiative. As part of these projects, 67,000 native trees and shrubs will be planted within a 175-hectare conservation area to enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration, with 28,000 tCO2e projected to be sequestered over the 25-year life of the project.\n\nSimilar biodiversity and carbon projects have been implemented across other parts of the portfolio, including two soil carbon sequestration projects registered with the Emissions Reduction Fund. At Steam Plains Station, MAM has commenced the restoration of a former irrigated rice farm to a native grassy-woodland, typical of what would have existed prior to European settlement. Land-use change from an annual cropping system to perennial grasses and native woodland is a well-established method of sequestering carbon in the soil and the project will help\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe business towards carbon neutrality while enhancing biodiversity. Similarly, at Merrimba Station, New South Wales, a soil carbon project has been established across country suitable for growing multi-species cover crops. Careful management by the station manager has enabled a diverse pasture containing grasses, legumes and forbs to establish, helping to boost soil organic carbon and stimulate life below the soil. Livestock have also been introduced to graze the paddock to maximise vegetative growth and soil carbon sequestration. Preliminary analysis has presented encouraging results, with an estimated 2.9 tCO2e per hectare being sequestered so far.\n\nIn New York and New Jersey, Macquarie-managed container terminal operator, Maher Terminals, has repurposed 151 reinforced concrete platforms, initially designed to elevate containers off the ground for screening by US Customs & Border Protection, as artificial reefs. After confirmation from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) that the platforms were ideally suited to serve as foundation material for artificial reefs, Maher committed all necessary funding and coordinated with the NJDEP, longshore labour, and a contractor to relocate the platforms to a designated location where it is creating a new reef ecosystem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Funding the circular economy\n\nThe circular economy reflects a need for society to rethink its approach to the use of products and raw materials, prevent waste and pollution while supporting the regeneration of natural systems. This is an area of focus for our own operations as well as an area of past and future investment opportunity.\n\nMacquarie's CGM business has recently launched a sustainable device lifecycle program for telecoms corporate customers, enabling more sustainable device management services and increased circularity in the smart device economy. The program aims to do this by extending the useful life of a device through a 'return, refurbish, redeploy' approach, embedding an e-waste recycling solution and offsetting the carbon footprint of the entire device lifecycle.\n\n## CGM also provided a\n\nconstruction-to-permanent loan to Camston Wrather, a science and engineering company specialising in the recovery of sustainable resources from e-waste. The loan will support the development of Camston Wrather's production facility in allowing them to fulfil their long-term expansion plans of economically and efficiently lowering the carbon intensity of precious metals, plastics, and other metal products through recycling.\n\n67,000 native trees and shrubs will be planted within a 175-hectare conservation area to enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration.'",

This is why Macquarie and Generation UK have this year launched a pioneering green jobs programme. The initiative is the first of its kind offering profession-specific training to people facing barriers into employment to help them enter the green sector. The programme has been developed with guidance from experts across Macquarie, GIG, and with catalytic funding from the Macquarie Group Foundation. As at 31 March 2022, 12 learners have completed the course and are accredited.\n\nIn Korea, GIG and TotalEnergies have offered scholarships to three outstanding students from the Ulsan Institute of Science and Technology. The scholarships form part of the Ulsan floating offshore wind farm's cooperation programme with the university. In addition to the scholarships, the program fosters the development of local talent through internship programmes and industry-led lectures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in social housing\n\nAn undersupply of housing, coupled with high property prices relative to wages, continues to drive the need for affordable and social housing across the UK. Recognising this challenge, MAM has been helping to finance the UK's affordable housing sector and local authorities, with more than \u00a3800 million invested in these sectors on behalf of clients over the past five years.\n\nThis year, MAM provided a long-term debt facility of \u00a350 million to Melin Homes, a charitable registered social housing association in Wales. The financing provides Melin Homes with both flexibility and certainty as it seeks to deliver 1,000 new homes by 2025 and meet its long-term growth ambitions. MAM also provided \u00a380 million of long-term debt financing to not-for-profit association Havebury Housing Partnership. MAM's investment features a minimum 30-year term and a bespoke drawdown and repayment profile tailored to the housing association's investment needs. The debt financing, which forms part of a broader \u00a3210 million package, will enable Havebury Housing Partnership to maintain the quality of its existing portfolio and support its goal for all homes to achieve an Energy Performance Certificate of Level C by 2030. The financing will also support the development of 250 new homes per year to 2028.\n\nAs the impacts from climate change become more apparent, integrating sustainability and wellbeing into the design of affordable homes has become increasingly important. To support green affordable housing projects in Kenya, UK Climate Investments - a joint venture between Macquarie's GIG and the UK Government - has committed \u00a330 million to help deliver approximately 10,000 new\n\ngreen homes that will provide affordable ownership and rental opportunities for low-income families in the country.\n\nIn Australia, a joint venture managed by MAM is launching Local, a new build-to-rent platform designed to create positive change in the Australian housing market. The platform, which incorporates impact housing and targets zero carbon emissions, will seek to provide sustainable housing at an attainable price in an inclusive community for residents. All Local projects will incorporate a targeted component of impact housing with accommodation to create positive social impact, focusing on three groups - key workers such as nurses and hospitality workers, people living with a disability and women over the age of 55 who are at risk of homelessness.\n\nIn addition, MAM has launched an impact investing platform focused on specialist disability accommodation dwellings in Australia. The platform intentionally seeks to deliver secure, integrated and sustainable homes to tenants eligible under Australia's National Disability Insurance Scheme. MAM has been engaged in the sector since 2017 and its new venture represents a scaled, institutional-grade investment platform. MAM uses a bespoke framework to manage, measure and report the impact of the portfolio. In addition to social impact, the platform seeks to minimise the environmental impact of its operations through energy saving initiatives and offsets to produce net zero emissions. MAM's involvement - with its housing partners, government and other market players - has helped raise institutional awareness and understanding of the sector as an asset class and its potential for delivering both social and environmental impact.",

We seek to manage these impacts by monitoring and reducing resource use, maintaining innovative and sustainable workplaces, maintaining carbon neutrality, and improving the sustainability of our supply chain.\n\nMacquarie's 2025 Sustainability Plan articulates our corporate sustainability commitments with specific and measurable targets across environmental and social pillars. In FY2022, the Plan was updated in line with current technical guidance, industry trends and Macquarie's ambition to achieve Net Zero emissions.\n\n## Emissions from energy use and business travel\n\nMacquarie's FY2022 absolute emissions decreased by 38% from FY2021. (22)\n\nLast year, Macquarie committed to reaching net zero operational emissions by 2025. (23) This was supported by existing targets to reduce electricity use and meet all of our operational electricity needs from renewable sources.\n\nThis year, Macquarie has sourced the equivalent of 100% of our electricity consumption from renewable sources through a combination of green tariffs (43%) and energy attribute certificates (57%). (24) Due to a lack of availability, we were unable to source renewable energy certificates within the South Korean market, which is a requirement of the RE100 market boundary criteria. All other renewable energy purchases were sourced in line with the criteria and we are 98.4% compliant at this time. We will continue to work towards full RE100 compliance by FY2023, ahead of our FY2025 commitment. Our FY2022 electricity consumption was 40,996 MWh, which is a decrease of 5% from the previous year due to premises upgrades and our cloud transformation strategy that enables rationalisation of servers.\n\nMacquarie has expanded its definition of Scope 3 emissions relating to business travel to include air travel, ground transportation, hotels\n\nand food and beverages. (25) Additionally, the air travel emission calculation methodology has matured to be more comprehensive and now reflects the class of ticket flown (for example economy, business class).\n\nBusiness travel emissions continue to be affected due to ongoing travel restrictions in place since March 2020. In FY2022, we continued to adopt virtual collaboration and conference tools to support effective working from home and to help reduce the need for business travel.\n\nIn FY2022, we initiated a review of the additional Scope 3 categories of emissions resulting from upstream operational activities. (26) We will assess the materiality of the emissions from each activity and establish data strategies and calculation methodologies to support baselining and prioritisation of reduction efforts.\n\nScope 1 emissions are not considered to be material, comprising 2.5% of Macquarie's total operational emissions.\n\n## Carbon neutrality\n\nSince 2010, Macquarie has maintained our carbon neutral commitment by working to reduce and offset emissions. (27) In FY2022, to meet this commitment, Macquarie purchased and retired a portfolio of Australian Carbon Credit Units and other voluntary carbon offsets that meet the Verified Carbon Standard. The projects were selected based on quality and verifiable emissions reductions. Supported by the sale of carbon credits on international markets, they provide solutions to reduce carbon emissions in each of the regions in which Macquarie operates.\n\n## Carbon and energy data for FY2022 (28)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (22) Unless otherwise stated, all operational emissions in this report have been calculated using the market-based method. PwC has provided limited assurance over selected information for the FY2022 reporting period as detailed in its independent assurance report available on Macquarie's website. The assurance report includes a table outlining Macquarie's carbon and energy data for the last 10 years as well as a definition of the different scopes.\n- (23)  Operational emissions include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and emissions from business travel.\n- (24) Energy Attribute Certificates have been retired or will be retired by 30 June 2022.\n- (25)  Food & beverages include entertainment and business travel.\n- (26) As defined in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n- (27) Covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and business travel.\n- (28)  Note that the baseline for Scope 2 electricity emissions is FY2009 while, due to data availability, the baseline for Scope 3 business travel emissions is FY2010. As highlighted in the text, FY2022 Scope 3 emissions are not comparable to previous periods due to a change in methodology.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable buildings\n\nMacquarie's corporate offices are fitted with water and energy efficient fittings and fixtures and are continually monitored for energy performance, environmental quality and staff comfort. Macquarie's new global headquarters, currently being developed in Sydney, achieved a 6-Star Green Star Design rating. The design of the public spaces in the development are informed by community consultation and will integrate public amenities, First Nations design principles, native plants and public art. At the end of FY2022, 71% of Macquarie staff occupied a sustainably-rated office. (29)\n\n## Resource efficiency\n\nWe continue to raise staff awareness and improve recycling rates across our regional headquarters. In all major Sydney offices and our London headquarters, we reached an average recycling rate of 45%. Office closures and reduced occupancy during the pandemic have impacted our waste data collection and verification. This is scheduled to resume as our people return to office.\n\nIn addition, in FY2022, we committed to divert a minimum of 75% of the construction and demolition waste from landfill, and the elimination of single use plastic in premises operations by FY2025.\n\nIn FY2022, paper use remained the same as FY2021. Paper use data is collected across most of Macquarie's offices, representing approximately 97% of Macquarie staff. In addition, we have increased our commitment to a 60% reduction target by FY2025 from a 2019 baseline. The environmental impacts of paper use are also being addressed through an ongoing commitment to use certified sustainable or recycled paper stock for 100% of office paper needs.\n\nFollowing a review in FY2021, we have committed to managing all our electronic waste through sustainably-certified suppliers to ensure it is managed in a responsible manner.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nMacquarie is enhancing its procurement strategy to drive positive environmental, social and economic impacts across our supply chain. A sustainable procurement framework is in development to integrate sustainability considerations throughout the procurement lifecycle. This will bring our approach in closer alignment to global best practice as outlined in the ISO 20400: 2017. (30)\n\nThis will support our revised commitment to increase spend on environmentally and socially sustainable products to 80% of our global purchasing needs for prioritised goods by 2025 and 100% by 2030.\n\nMacquarie continues to implement a risk-based approach to environmental and social due diligence in our supply chain. Macquarie includes environmental and social risk requirements within relevant commercial agreements and tender documents. Since the inception of the Supplier Governance Policy in mid-2019, over 1,250 suppliers have responded to Macquarie's ESG questionnaire developed to assess their ESG credentials, and over 1,050 have acknowledged our Principles for Suppliers . Our risk-based independent assurance programme involves an in-depth assessment and onsite meetings with suppliers exposed to heightened environmental and social risks based on the country of operation and service category. Border and office closures due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our ability to fully execute the intended assurance plan. Macquarie remains committed to this process and focussed on expanding it as offices reopen.\n\nIn FY2022, we developed a more extensive 'Responsible Supply Chain' contractual clause which requires relevant suppliers to comply with our Principles for Suppliers , maintain written records documenting their compliance with the Principles and allow Macquarie to assess the suppliers' compliance. This will be incorporated as a standard clause for any new suppliers exposed to heightened environmental or social risk, whilst contracts for existing suppliers will be revised at the point of renewal.\n\nMacquarie's approach towards identifying and mitigating the risk of modern slavery within our supply chain and business operations is set out in our Modern Slavery Transparency Statement as described on page 49.\n\nIn FY2022, Macquarie spent over $A16.5 million (or 0.5% of global spend) with minority-owned businesses in our tier one and two supply chain. (31)\n\nWe continue to be committed to sourcing 1% of our global spend from diverse suppliers and have now expanded our strategy to include 10% of small suppliers by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information is available at macquar ie.com/esg\n\nThe Principles for Suppliers are available at macquarie.com /suppliers\n\nMacquarie's Modern Slavery Transparency Statement can be downloaded from macquar ie.com/esg",

        "page_content": "## Environmental, Social and Governance\n\nContinued\n\n## Client experience\n\nClients are at the core of our business. They put their trust in Macquarie by choosing to work with us, and we seek to maintain this trust by focussing on delivering exceptional client experiences and outcomes.\n\nMacquarie relies on building and maintaining enduring relationships with our co-investors, corporate, institutional, government and retail clients across all our businesses.\n\nOur specialist teams engage with our clients through a variety of channels including one-to-one contact, video and online, knowledge-based conferences and events, and other insight-based communications. We collect formal and informal feedback and use client and data insights to help shape our products and services.\n\n## Supporting clients\n\nAs part of our ongoing program of work to support our clients, Macquarie has continued to build staff capability.\n\nMacquarie's Banking and Financial Services (BFS) business has introduced an online First Nations cultural competency training program for relevant BFS client-facing teams, which was developed by an Australian Indigenous business specialising in cultural competency training. The program is designed to enhance participants' understanding of Indigenous people, culture and history while providing practical knowledge and skills to serve and support First Nations people more effectively.\n\nBFS also delivers quarterly virtual workshop training for specialist teams assisting clients experiencing heightened vulnerability and continues to deliver a support program providing bespoke assistance tailored for client needs. This may include a direct paid referral to an external specialist holistic community support services provider with whom BFS partners to support our clients.\n\nIn addition, BFS has continued to offer financial support to clients impacted by natural disaster events. The business has recently streamlined and enhanced its natural disaster response processes.\n\n## Our response to COVID-19\n\nAmidst the changing external environment of the pandemic, Macquarie has continued providing tailored support to clients impacted by COVID-19. BFS delivered relief via its existing financial assistance service and Business Banking relationship managers worked closely with SME clients to provide personalised care and support. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CGM has continued to look for ways to help clients with their long-term resilience and response to disruption and has recently shifted its focus to supply and demand challenges triggered by the pandemic that have contributed to market volatility. CGM's expertise and strong market position enables the business to work closely with clients to help them navigate the challenges of the current environment. Macquarie Capital has also been providing expertise, advice and capital solutions to help our clients and partners to navigate COVID-19 and the related market disruption - from strategic advisory and capital raising to supporting our clients' continued growth and transformation in key sectors reshaped by COVID-19, such as healthcare and education.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have been evolving how we partner and engage with our clients. We are now enhancing and embedding many of the changes trialled at the beginning of the pandemic. For example, MAM held its Annual Meetings virtually again this year, making it easier for investors to access the events, and resulting in significantly higher client attendance compared with prior in-person and virtual events. We also continue to invest in the quality of our digital client experience, with thought leadership webinars, virtual knowledge sharing forums and tools such as MAM's client portals, which enable easy and timely access to key investment information.\n\nAs the pandemic has presented new opportunities for fraud attempts and phishing scams, BFS initiated a proactive campaign to educate clients on fraud protection and provide a range of educational resources. This campaign, combined with leading digital security features such as the Macquarie Authenticator mobile app, is a key part of our proactive approach to keeping clients' information safe.\n\n## Fair and efficient resolution of issues\n\nReflecting our commitment to our clients, Macquarie Bank Limited subscribes to the Australian Banking Association 2019 Banking Code of Practice (as amended).\n\nMacquarie has a robust complaint management framework across our retail banking business to ensure client complaints are resolved quickly and fairly. BFS teams analyse complaint data to understand the root causes of complaints so they can be addressed at their source, with oversight from senior management. In FY2022, 44% of BFS complaints were resolved within the same business day and 90% within five business days. For the second year running BFS external complaints with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority were lowest in the sector relative to loan and deposit funds under management.\n\nMacquarie's Customer Advocate is separate to the operating, risk and support groups including our internal dispute resolution teams and reports directly to the CEO. The Customer Advocate's role is to:\n\n- \u00b7 listen to our customers and provide a customer-centric voice when making recommendations to improve customer experience\n- \u00b7 work with Macquarie complaint teams to promote fair and reasonable customer outcomes.\n- \u00b7 minimise the risk of future problems by reviewing key customer themes and new product approvals to identify opportunities to enhance products, services, systems and processes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information is available at macquari e.com/bank\n\nFurther information on the Customer Advocate office is available at macquarie.com/custome r-advocate\n\nThe Banking Code of Practice can be downloaded at macquarie.com/ba nking-code",

We recruit talented individuals and encourage them to realise their potential in an environment that values excellence, innovation and creativity. By supporting their development and wellbeing, we ensure Macquarie continues to meet the highest standards and serves the evolving needs of our stakeholders.\n\n## Evolution of the Macquarie Leadership Standards\n\nIn FY2022, new Leadership Standards were launched for all Macquarie director-level staff. The Standards were used this year to establish promotion criteria for all director-level staff, following last year's successful pilot for Executive Director promotions. Further, as part of broader succession planning efforts, the Executive Committee have all undertaken personal development planning aligned to, and grounded in, the Macquarie Leadership Standards. The Standards also underpin the design of the new Director Leadership Program (DLP). This program was designed and built for Macquarie's Associate and Division Directors globally, and the learning outcomes are mapped to each of the standards. DLP was piloted in FY2022 with 23 Associate Directors from ANZ. The pilot received favourable feedback, delivering on its objective to build leadership capability, and will now scale and launch globally. By participating, director-level staff will deepen their understanding of what it means to be a leader at Macquarie, and further develop a sense of personal responsibility to lead in alignment with the Macquarie Purpose and Leadership Standards.\n\n## Future-skilling\n\nAcknowledging the industry demand for certain future-focussed skills along with competition for talent in the marketplace, Macquarie, like many organisations, has been investing in and growing these skills for many years. In FY2022, a cross-functional team used a human centred design approach to undertake a review of how the current and future needs of our people and our businesses continues to evolve. Based on the early outcomes of this review, the team launched a data capability future-skilling pilot. Learnings from this pilot will inform further evolution of the global approach to addressing future-skilling needs across Macquarie.\n\n## Training\n\nDuring FY2022, 2,683 instructor-led courses were delivered globally, 503 of these sessions were on Management and Leadership, 271 on Personal Effectiveness and 85 on wellbeing. As well as instructor-led offerings, 1,587 web-based training sessions were completed.\n\nRecognising the ongoing impact the global pandemic has on the wellbeing of our people, Macquarie made a non-mandatory masterclass available to all director-level staff (globally 867 director-level staff attended). The masterclass specifically focused on the topic of burnout and provided tools for attendees as individuals, and as leaders to support their teams.\n\n## Early career pipelines\n\nEmpowering and investing in early career talent is a global priority aligned to our purpose.\n\nMacquarie's CEO, Shemara Wikramanayake, is an advocate for the Girls Who Invest vision that 30% of the world's investable capital is managed by women by 2030. Macquarie participates in the Girls Who Invest internship program in the Americas, hiring two sophomore interns each year. In FY2022, the Americas also launched two new early careers partnerships, sourcing interns from Sponsorship for Educational Opportunity and BLK Capital Management.\n\nIn EMEA, the Early Careers Team have refined the eligibility criteria and recruitment process for the Junior Associate Program to ensure positive diversity outcomes. The Junior Associate program is a partnership between Macquarie, London Works and the Social Mobility Foundation to provide careers access to social mobility candidates who are currently studying at a London University. Students gain valuable experience by working with Macquarie two days per week whilst they complete their degree.\n\nIn Australia, 36 individuals from asylum seeker and refugee backgrounds and 14 First Nations interns completed paid summer internships via the Career Seekers and Career Trackers programs. These programs provide students with the experience and skills development they need to launch their careers.\n\n## Talent and performance management\n\nMacquarie's approach to identifying and developing talent continues to evolve into a more integrated, developmental approach focused on generating strategic talent insights and a positive employee experience.\n\nFY2022 saw all Operating and Central Service Groups formalising a new Macquarie-wide consistent, technology-enabled performance management approach that promotes ongoing performance and development check-ins and at least one annual career development conversation, in addition to an annual performance appraisal. In FY2022, the number of career development conversations doubled, and feedback collected from our people via human centred design empathy interviews indicates these conversations are highly valued and are felt to be effective tools to support career progression.\n\nMacquarie's approach to performance assessment has also evolved to more clearly distinguishing what someone achieved and how they achieved it. This distinction leads to greater emphasis on assessing whether behaviours are aligned to our cultural expectations and our Code of Conduct .",

The majority of new hires joined to take on new roles that support Macquarie's strong performance, although at 14.8%, voluntary turnover is higher than it was during the pandemic, reflecting global industry trends.\n\n## Hybrid working\n\nAround the world, our people have continued to work in a hybrid manner, balancing time spent in the office (where permitted by local regulations) with time working from home. Throughout the pandemic, Macquarie has provided people with the tools and technology to enable them to collaborate effectively. This year, Macquarie reaffirmed our ongoing commitment to flexible and hybrid working and provided all people with a common definition and guiding principles for leading hybrid teams.

Additionally, our clients, many of whom also operate in regulated sectors, expect us to have detailed current knowledge of public policy issues and drivers when we provide advice and services to them.\n\nMacquarie contributes to public policy in the markets in which we operate in the following ways:\n\n- \u00b7 participating in government and other policy advisory panels when invited to do so, and where we can make a differentiated contribution based on our expertise\n- \u00b7 making submissions to industry consultation processes and inquiries, where appropriate. These may be processes established by parliaments, government departments or government agencies such as regulators. Submissions may be made by Macquarie directly or as part of a broader industry group\n- \u00b7 engaging with parliamentarians and policy-makers through avenues such as formal meetings, attending events, speaking in public forums and appearing before parliamentary inquiries where appropriate\n- \u00b7 contributing to the advocacy work done by industry groups in key markets around the world. Given the diversity of Macquarie's business activities, we are members of industry groups representing sectors such as financial services and markets, infrastructure, energy as well as general business peak bodies.\n\nIn Australia, political parties are funded by a mix of public and private monies. As part of its engagement with the Australian political process, Macquarie provides financial support to the major political parties, primarily through paid attendance at events.\n\nMacquarie has a full disclosure policy and declares all monies paid to political parties to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) regardless of any thresholds or other provisions that may otherwise limit the need to disclose. This disclosure is made by way of an annual AEC return on a 1 July to 30 June basis and is published by the AEC in the February following the end of the disclosure year.",

The Foundation encourages our people to give back to the communities in which they live and work by contributing service, leadership, and financial support to the causes and community serving organisations they feel passionately about.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontributed since inception\n\n$A520m+\n\n2,300+\n\nnon-profit organisations supported in FY2022\n\nThe Foundation's total giving since inception surpassed half a billion dollars in FY2022, totalling $A520 million.\n\nAmid ongoing challenges around the world, including the continued effects of the pandemic, this year the Foundation focused on supporting existing and new grant partner relationships, and engaging our staff and businesses to support the communities where they live and work. In FY2022, a total of $A44 million was contributed to 2,300 community organisations around the world by Macquarie people and the Foundation.\n\nFocusing on the communities where Macquarie people live and work enables a better understanding of local needs and helps to leverage employee time, expertise, and networks for greater impact. In FY2022, our people continued to volunteer their time in a variety of ways, including pro bono service and leading on non-profit organisation boards. Many employees provide their time and skills to non-profit organisations supporting social and economic mobility of young people, aligned with the Foundation's global grant-making focus.\n\nVirtual volunteering remained active throughout FY2022, with Macquarie people continuing to be highly engaged in global initiatives such as Foundation Week, as well as regional initiatives including Mentoring Week in the Americas, Better Migration Week in Asia, Raise mentoring in ANZ and Social Mobility Week in EMEA.\n\nThe eighth annual Foundation Week in October 2021 saw a total of $A2.7 million contributed to 175 non-profits, with more than 212 fundraising and volunteering events held across 44 offices. By hosting 87% of Foundation Week fundraising and volunteer events either virtually or in a hybrid way (1) , Macquarie people ensured the non-profit organisations they were passionate about still received critical support despite the ongoing pandemic.\n\n## Humanitarian support for Ukraine\n\nIn support of communities and families across Ukraine, our people and the Foundation have to date donated a total of $A3.5 million to organisations working to provide vital humanitarian support. Recipients included International Medical Corps and Razom.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $A20 million allocation for Social Impact Investing\n\nTo expand the scope and scale of the Foundation's impact, a one-time $A20 million allocation was made to the Foundation to enable the expansion of the Social Impact Investing program over the coming years. This activity aims to generate positive, measurable social returns, with any financial returns returned to the Foundation for additional social impact. The allocation builds on the Foundation's $A1 million impact investing pilot, as well as over 10 years of wider sector support.\n\n## Green Jobs program launch\n\nIn FY2022, Macquarie and Generation UK launched a pioneering green jobs programme. The initiative is the first of its kind offering profession-specific training to people facing barriers into employment to help them enter the green sector.\n\nThe programme has been developed with guidance from experts across Macquarie, the Foundation and Green Investment Group (GIG), with catalytic funding provided by the Foundation. 12 (2) learners have completed the course and are accredited.\n\n## Racial Equity Fund expanded\n\nThe Macquarie Racial Equity Fund (REF) was established in 2020 in the Americas to support solutions that promote a more equitable and just society for all people.\n\nIn FY2021 and FY2022, $US1 million from the REF was allocated across eight organisations supporting one-off and multi-year projects, including Black Girls Code, the Thurgood Marshall Scholarship Fund, and YWCA's WE360 project supporting entrepreneurs of colour. In FY2022 Macquarie expanded the REF to $US5 million over five years to support direct relief programs, research, policy, education and economic equity initiatives.",

Working with these partners, the Foundation aims to maximise social impact with both financial resources and the skills and networks of our people. Macquarie people are engaged with many of the grant partner organisations through skilled volunteering, mentoring, career development and employability programs. These organisations include The Opportunity Network in the Americas, Generation Australia in ANZ, NavGurukul in Asia and Social Mobility Foundation in EMEA.\n\n## COVID-19 donation fund fully deployed\n\nIn FY2022, the Foundation fully deployed the COVID-19 donation fund, with grants made in FY2021 and FY2022 to 40 (3) organisations in 32 (4) countries across three focus areas:\n\n- \u00b7 health research : $A2 million allocated to two Australian projects\n- \u00b7 direct relief : $A7.35 million allocated to 29 organisations\n- \u00b7 economic recovery : $A10.65 million allocated to 12 organisations.\n\n## Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award\n\nIn 2019, Macquarie announced five winners of the Macquarie 50th Anniversary Award to each receive $A10 million over a five-year period for bold, social impact projects: Last Mile Health, Monash University's World Mosquito Program, Murdoch Children's Research Institute's World Scabies Program, Social Finance and The Ocean Cleanup.\n\nThroughout FY2022, the five winners continued to make significant progress against social and environmental issues while adapting to pandemic challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about the Macquarie 50th\n\nAnniversary Award, see pages 70 and 71.\n\n## FY2022 contribution amount\n\nTotal Macquarie spend (including matching of staff contributions)\n\nStaff contribution (estimation based on Foundation match funding)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $A31,629,000\n\n$A12,596,000\n\n- (3)  Three organisations received more than one grant.\n- (4) Country total includes both project location and organisation headquarters location where applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Macquarie Sports\n\nWith COVID-19 lockdowns continuing to affect Macquarie Sports' clinics, Macquarie Sports launched the Virtual Ambassador Program, aimed at inspiring children to pursue sports through virtual interactions with Australian sporting identities. More than 900 students from nine primary schools across Australia participated in the pilot program, which gave many remote and regional schools the opportunity to engage with some of Australia's best sportspeople during the pandemic. Participating schools were also sent shipments of sporting equipment to encourage ongoing involvement in sports and physical activity.\n\nIn FY2022, the Macquarie Sports Scholarships aligned with Macquarie's Summer Internship Program. Scholarship recipients benefited from this alignment with an 11-week work placement and greater networking and program opportunities alongside the group-wide summer internship cohort.\n\n## Macquarie Group Collection\n\nThe Macquarie Group Collection's (the Collection's) annual Emerging Artist Prize and Exhibition celebrated its 10 th year. In recognition of this milestone, 10 finalists were selected from a record number of submissions, enabling more emerging artists to be supported. The event was once again held virtually, with strong external engagement following a successful social media campaign.\n\nThe Collection has been supporting emerging Australian artists for over 30 years by acquiring and displaying their works in Macquarie offices around the world. The Collection features art in all media, around the theme The Land and its Psyche , reflecting the diversity of the Australian landscape as seen through the eyes of its artists. Now comprising more than 950 works selected by a volunteer committee of Macquarie employees and a curatorial expert, the Collection is on display in around 41 Macquarie offices worldwide.",

The Board is committed to oversight of Macquarie's performance, risk management, engagement with regulators and culture and to promoting the creation of enduring value by realising opportunities for the benefit of our clients, community, shareholders and our people. Macquarie's robust risk management framework supports the Board in its role. The Board is ultimately responsible for the framework, including oversight of its operation by Management.\n\n## Role of Management\n\nThe Group Heads of the Operating and Central Service Groups are responsible for the implementation of the risk management framework in their groups. They are required semi-annually to attest that key risks have been identified and are adequately controlled in their groups. These management representations support the sign-off of the half-year and the full-year financial statements.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management adopts the 'three lines of defence' model which sets risk ownership responsibilities functionally independent from oversight and assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management Group (RMG) forms the second line of defence and provides independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks\n- \u00b7 primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. The risk owner is the first line of defence. An important part of the role of all staff throughout Macquarie is to ensure they manage risks appropriately\n- \u00b7 Internal Audit, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\n## Overview\n\nMacquarie's risk management framework is the totality of systems, structures, policies, processes and people within Macquarie that identify, measure, monitor, report and control or mitigate internal and external sources of material risk. Material risks are those that could have a material impact, financial or non-financial on Macquarie. Macquarie's material risks include aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social (including climate change), equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks. The risk management framework applies to all Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails about the risks we manage are available at macquarie.com/ris k-management\n\n## Key components\n\n## Core risk management principles\n\nMacquarie's approach to risk management is based on stable and robust core risk management principles. These are:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding worst-case outcomes: Macquarie's risk management approach is based on examining the consequences of worst-case outcomes and determining whether these are acceptable and within Macquarie's risk appetite. This approach is adopted for all material risk types and is often achieved by stress testing. Macquarie operates a number of sophisticated quantitative risk management processes, but the foundation of the approach is the informed consideration of both quantitative and qualitative inputs by highly experienced professionals\n- \u00b7 ownership of risk at the business level: Group Heads are responsible for ownership of material risks that arise in, or because of, the business' operations, including identification, measurement, control and mitigation of these risks. Before taking decisions, clear analysis of the risks is sought to ensure those taken are consistent with the risk appetite and strategy of Macquarie\n- \u00b7 requirement for an independent sign-off by RMG : Macquarie places significant importance on having a strong, independent risk management function charged with signing off all material risk acceptance decisions. It is essential that RMG has the capability to do this effectively. RMG has invested in recruiting skilled professionals from a range of disciplines, including those with trading or advisory and capital markets experience. For all material proposals, RMG's opinion must be sought at an early stage in the decision-making process. The approval document submitted to senior management must include independent input from RMG on risk and return.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management Group\n\nRMG, which forms the second line of defence, is an independent and centralised function responsible for independent and objective review and challenge, oversight, monitoring and reporting in relation to Macquarie's material risks. RMG designs and oversees the implementation of the risk management framework. RMG is structured into specialist functional divisions, depicted below, and employs an integrated approach to risk analysis and management across risk classes. RMG's assessment and monitoring of risks involves a collaborative effort across the divisions to ensure a detailed analysis takes place both at the individual and aggregate risk level.\n\nRMG's oversight of risk is based on the following five principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Centralised risk management : RMG's responsibility covers the whole of Macquarie. It assesses risks from a Macquarie-wide perspective and provides a consistent approach across Macquarie\n- \u00b7 Independence : RMG is independent of Macquarie's Operating and Central Service Groups. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie's CRO, reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the BRiC. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions\n- \u00b7 Approval of all new business activities: The Operating and Central Service Groups may not undertake new businesses or activities, offer new products, enter new markets, or undertake significant projects without first consulting RMG. RMG reviews and assesses risk and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committees and the Board\n- \u00b7 Frequent monitoring and reporting : The risk profile of Macquarie with respect to all material risks is monitored by RMG on an ongoing basis. Centralised systems exist to allow RMG to monitor financial risks daily. For the valuation of trading positions and deals, daily revaluation factors are sourced, where possible, from independent market sources. Reporting on all material risks is provided to senior management and the Board.\n- \u00b7 Continuous assessment : RMG continually reviews risks to account for changes in market circumstances and developments within Macquarie's business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  The Board Risk Committee assists the Board by providing oversight of Macquarie's risk management framework and advising the Board on Macquarie's risk appetite, risk culture and risk management strategy. In addition, the Board Governance and Compliance Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for monitoring the regulatory, legal, compliance and financial crime risk matters for Macquarie, including the conduct risk management framework, and reviews and monitors Macquarie's work health and safety, environmental and social risk management policies and customer and client reporting.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe Internal Audit Division, as the third line, provides independent and objective risk-based assurance to the Board Audit Committee (BAC), other Board Committees and senior management on the compliance with, and effectiveness of, Macquarie's financial and risk management framework, including its governance, systems, structures, policies, processes and people for managing material risks. The Internal Audit Division assesses whether material risks have been properly identified by management and reported to the Board, and whether key internal controls have been properly designed and are operating effectively and sustainably to mitigate those material risks.\n\nThe BAC has primary power of direction over the Internal Audit Division and is accountable for reviewing the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function. The Head of Internal Audit reports functionally to the BAC and is primarily accountable to it. The Head of Internal Audit has unrestricted access to the BAC and its Chair and meets privately with the BAC members regularly during the year. The BAC monitors and reviews the performance, degree of independence and remuneration of the Head of Internal Audit. The BAC also approves any appointment and removal of the Head of Internal Audit. The Head of Internal Audit reports operationally to the CRO for day-to-day management. For audit matters relating to RMG, the role of the CRO will be replaced by the CEO.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\nContinued\n\n## Risk appetite management\n\nMacquarie's risk appetite, being the nature and amount of risk that Macquarie is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan is detailed in the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) . The RAS states transactions must generate returns proportionate to the risks. Accordingly, a risk and return analysis is required for all significant new deals, products and businesses.\n\nThe RAS is accessible to all staff and is referred to in the Code of Conduct . The principles of the RAS are implemented primarily through the following mechanisms:\n\n## Risk tolerances\n\nRisk tolerances have been established to ensure we only accept risks that are consistent with our risk appetite.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nLimits translate risk appetite principles into hard constraints, being the Global Risk Limit that constrains Macquarie's aggregate level of risk as well as granular limits for specific financial risks.\n\nMacquarie sets the Global Risk Limit with reference not only to capital but also to earnings so that in a prolonged, severe downturn, earnings and surplus capital are sufficient to cover losses and maintain market confidence in Macquarie. The Global Risk Limit requires Macquarie to maintain sufficient capital above regulatory minimums throughout a severe but plausible economic downturn, without taking mitigating actions. The potential financial impact of a non-financial risk event is also included in the Global Risk Limit.\n\nMacquarie operates under a strict principle of 'no limits, no dealing'. Compliance with granular limits is monitored by the business and RMG. These granular limits are set to allow the Businesses to achieve their near-term plans while promoting a reassessment of the opportunity and associated risks as the limit is approached.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nMacquarie seeks high standards in addressing non-financial risks. Macquarie monitors and reports on a range of metrics for non-financial risks that provide a measure of our risk profile for these risks.\n\nThese metrics provide a basis for analysis and communication of risk, for forcing explicit consideration of the risk profile, raising awareness of risks and facilitating debate and actions in relation to potential future risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther explanation on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Work Health and Safety risks in particular is set out in the ESG section of this Annual Report.\n\n## Policies\n\nPolicies are key tools for ensuring that risks taken are consistent with Macquarie's risk appetite. They are designed to influence and determine all major decisions and actions, and all activities must take place within the boundaries they set.\n\n## New product and business approval process\n\nAll new businesses, new products, and significant changes to existing businesses, products, processes or systems are subject\n\nto a rigorous, interactive approval process that adheres to the principles stated in the RAS. This results in constructive dialogue on risk matters between RMG and the relevant business.\n\nThis formal process is designed so that the proposed transaction or operation can be managed. All relevant risks are reviewed to ensure they are identified and addressed prior to implementation. These risks are also monitored on an ongoing basis. The approvals of RMG, Financial Management Group, Legal and Governance and other relevant stakeholders within Macquarie are required. RMG also checks that all necessary internal approvals are obtained prior to commencement.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is an integral component of Macquarie's risk management framework and a key input to the capital adequacy assessment process. Stress testing incorporates enterprise-wide scenario analyses in which losses and capital are driven by the chosen economic parameters of a scenario. The scenarios as well as their economic parameters are tailored to Macquarie's portfolio.\n\nStress testing is used to validate that Macquarie's capital targets and associated triggers remain appropriate given the risk profile of the portfolio. It is also used to identify areas of potential concentration in Macquarie's portfolio, as well as being a key measure of aggregate risk appetite, calibrated to Macquarie's ability to withstand severe stress.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture has been integral to Macquarie's risk management framework since inception. Primary responsibility for risk management in Macquarie, including risk culture, is at the business level. The Board, assisted by the BRiC, is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 forming a view on Macquarie's risk culture and the extent to which it supports the ability of Macquarie to operate consistently within its risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 reviewing, endorsing and monitoring Macquarie's approach to risk culture and conduct\n\nMacquarie's approach to maintaining an appropriate risk culture is based on three components:\n\n## Setting behavioural expectations\n\nSenior Management, with oversight from the Board, set behavioural expectations. The way we fulfil Macquarie's purpose is defined by our principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity. Staff are made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are specified in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by Management and cascaded through the organisation.\n\n## Leading and executing\n\nManagement implements behavioural expectations through:\n\n- \u00b7 organisational governance\n- \u00b7 leadership actions and communication\n- \u00b7 incentives and consequence management\n- \u00b7 organisational and individual capability.",

Mechanisms include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Culture team in RMG Behavioural Risk uses a well-developed assessment process, governed by the Risk Culture Framework. The team undertakes independent risk culture reviews across the Operating and Central Service Groups to assess the relative strengths and areas for development within a business or function.\n- \u00b7 reports incorporating behavioural elements (such as policy, limit and training breaches) are prepared by all Operating and Central Service Groups, including reports prepared by RMG, HR and Macquarie's Integrity Office and escalated, where relevant, according to our governance framework. These include regular reports relating to risk culture that are provided to senior management and the Board\n\nThese mechanisms facilitate a feedback loop of sharing good practice and lessons learned to enable cultural alignment.\n\n## Remuneration and consequence management\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework and consequence management process are designed to support its remuneration objectives, including delivering strong company performance over the short and long-term, while prudently managing risk and reinforcing the Code of Conduct and What We Stand For . Effective consequence management is a key component of Macquarie's risk culture. Macquarie aims to apply consequences for non-compliance in a timely manner, and as fairly and consistently as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Remuneration Report for more details on Macquarie's remuneration framework and consequence management process\n\n## Conduct risk\n\nMacquarie defines conduct risk as the risk of behaviour, action or omission by individuals employed by, or on behalf of, Macquarie or taken collectively in representing Macquarie that may have a negative outcome for our clients, counterparties, the communities and markets in which we operate, our staff, or Macquarie.\n\nSuch behaviour, actions or omissions may include:\n\n- \u00b7 disregard for Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For or the Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 breaches of laws or regulations\n- \u00b7 negligence and/or a lack of reasonable care and diligence\n- \u00b7 failure to escalate improper conduct.\n\nConduct risk can arise inadvertently or deliberately in any of Macquarie's Operating and Central Service Groups.\n\nMacquarie's approach to conduct risk management is integrated in our risk management framework and is consistent with our three lines of defence model. Risk-taking must be consistent with Macquarie's principles of What We Stand For : Opportunity, Accountability and Integrity which must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are outlined in the Board approved Code of Conduct .\n\nMacquarie has a range of controls and processes in place to identify and manage conduct risk, including:\n\n- \u00b7 conduct risks that may arise when Macquarie establishes a new business or product, or makes a significant change to an existing business, product, process or system are identified and assessed through the new business and product approval process\n- \u00b7 new and emerging conduct risks are identified through the annual strategy and business planning process\n- \u00b7 independent monitoring and surveillance conducted by RMG, in addition to front line supervisory activities performed by the business\n- \u00b7 where incidents occur, we investigate the underlying contributing behaviours and record where they are the root cause of the incident\n- \u00b7 the Risk and Control Self-assessment incorporates a conduct risk lens, requiring businesses to identify and assess their key conduct risks\n- \u00b7 performance-based remuneration reflects an individual's performance, which is assessed against a range of financial and non-financial factors including approach to risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 a global Staff Hotline for staff who wish to speak up anonymously\n- \u00b7 an Integrity Office that is an independent point of contact for staff to safely raise concerns about misconduct, unethical behaviour or breaches of the Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7 a Customer Advocate Office to promote fair and reasonable customer complaint outcomes and to review and assist with determining escalated customer complaints.",

These are daily profit and loss results that are directly attributable to market based activity from Macquarie's trading desks.\n\nMacquarie's market risk activities continue to be based on earning income from client-facing businesses. The majority of trading income is derived from client activities rather than outright proprietary trading activity.\n\nMacquarie's trading results over time have shown consistent profits and low volatility.

As permitted by AASB 9, prior year comparative information was not restated. AASB 9 contains requirements for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments, hedge accounting requirements and, from a credit provisioning perspective, introduced an expected credit loss methodology, which differed to the incurred loss methodology applied prior to FY2019.\n\nFor AASB 9 disclosures refer to Note 36.1 Credit risk to the financial statements including disclosure of loan asset exposures by stage of credit performance. Note 13 Expected credit losses to the financial statements discloses expected credit losses on loan assets by stage of credit performance. The FY2022 numbers presented below are calculated with reference to this information. Loan assets categorised as stage III in terms of AASB 9 are defined as 'credit impaired'. As noted, AASB 9 did not require the restatement of comparative information, and for that reason the comparative numbers in the graph below have not been restated.\n\nUnderlying credit quality in FY2022, as indicated by Stage I & II provisions and credit losses, has broadly improved compared to FY2021. The level of Stage I & II provisions to loan assets and net credit losses to loans assets is primarily caused by improved market conditions, portfolio growth and recoveries during FY2022 (as disclosed in the Notes to the financial statements).\n\n## Ratio of Provisions and Credit Impaired Loan Assets to Loans Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Stage I & II  Provisions to Loan Assets (Prior year comparatives to FY 1 8: Collective provision to loans, advances and leases) - Balance sheet\n- Net Stage III Loan Assets to Loan Assets (Prior year comparatives to FY 1 8: Impaired assets to loans, advances and leases) - Balance sheet\n- Net Credit Losses to Loan Assets (Prior year comparatives to FY 1 8: Net Credit losses to loans, advances and leases) - Income statement\n\n## Notes to prior year comparatives (3)\n\n- \u00b7 The collective provision is intended to cover losses inherent in the existing overall credit portfolio which are not yet specifically identifiable.\n- \u00b7 Loans, advances and leases excluded securitised mortgages, securitised Macquarie Capital loans/leases, segregated futures funds and receivables in the form of fees.\n- \u00b7 Net impaired assets and net losses excluded investment securities.\n- \u00b7 Net credit losses represented the total P&L impact in the stated period due to additional individual provisions, direct write-offs (net of any writebacks) and change in Stage I & II provisions.\n- (2)  The decrease in the ratio of Net Stage III Loan Assets to Loan Assets during FY2022 is attributable to the growth in the Home Loans portfolio and a reduction in the carrying value of loans within Stage III relative to the prior year.\n- (3)  The information for the financial years ended 31 March 2009-2022 is based on results using the Australian Accounting Standards that were effective and adopted by the Consolidated Entity at the reporting dates.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2022 continued\n\n## Directors' and officers' indemnification and insurance\n\nUnder MGL's Constitution, MGL indemnifies all past and present directors and secretaries of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including at this time the Directors named in this report and the Secretaries), against certain liabilities and costs incurred by them in their respective capacities. The indemnity covers the following liabilities and legal costs (subject to the exclusions described as follows):\n\n- \u00b7 all legal costs incurred in defending or resisting (or otherwise in connection with) proceedings in which the person becomes involved because of their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 every liability incurred by the person in their respective capacity\n- \u00b7 legal costs incurred by the person in good faith in obtaining legal advice on issues relevant to the performance and discharge of their duties as an officer of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, if that has been approved in accordance with MGL policy.\n\nThis indemnity does not apply to the extent that:\n\n- \u00b7 an indemnity by MGL of the person against the liability or legal costs, if given, would be made void by law.\n- \u00b7 MGL is forbidden by law to indemnify the person against the liability or legal costs, or\n\nMGL has also entered into a Deed of Access, Indemnity, Insurance and Disclosure (as amended from time to time) (Deed) with each of the Directors. Under the Deed, MGL agrees to, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 take out and maintain an insurance policy against liabilities incurred by the Director acting as an officer of MGL or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The insurance policy must be for an amount and on terms and conditions appropriate for a reasonably prudent company in MGL's position. Insurance must be maintained for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings)\n- \u00b7 indemnify the Director upon terms broadly consistent with the indemnity contained in MGL's Constitution\n- \u00b7 grant access to the Director to all relevant company papers (including Board papers and other documents) for seven years after the Director ceases to be a Director or until any proceedings commenced during that period have been finally resolved (including any appeal proceedings).\n\nIn addition, MGL made an Indemnity and Insurance Deed Poll on 12 September 2007 (Deed Poll). The benefit of the undertakings made by MGL under the Deed Poll have been given to each of the directors, secretaries, persons involved in the management and certain other persons, of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other companies where the person is acting as such at the specific request of MGL and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Deed Poll provides for broadly the same indemnity and insurance arrangements for those persons with the benefit of the Deed Poll as for the Deed described above. However, the Deed Poll does not provide for access to company documents.\n\nThe indemnities and insurance arrangements provided for under the MGL Constitution, the Deed and the Deed Poll, are broadly consistent with the corresponding indemnities and insurance\n\narrangements provided under the MBL Constitution and deeds entered into by MBL.\n\nMacquarie maintains a Directors' and Officers' insurance policy that provides cover for each person in favour of whom such insurance is required to be taken out under the Deed and the Deed Poll and for MGL in indemnifying such persons pursuant to the Deed and the Deed Poll. Relevant individuals pay the premium attributable to the direct coverage under the policy and MGL pays the premium attributable to the company reimbursement coverage under the policy. The Directors' and Officers' insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the premium payable under the policy and the nature of the liabilities insured.\n\nTo the extent permitted by law, MGL has agreed to reimburse its auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), for any liability (including reasonable legal costs) PwC incurs in connection with any claim by a third party arising from MGL's breach of the letter of engagement dated 22 June 2021.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has policies and procedures in place that are designed to ensure that, where operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, those obligations are identified, appropriately addressed and material breaches notified.\n\nThe Directors have determined that there has not been any material breach of those obligations during the financial year.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nFees paid or payable to PwC, being the auditor of the Consolidated Entity, for non-audit services during the year ended 31 March 2022 total $A12.7 million (2021: $A11.9 million). Further details of amounts paid or payable to PwC and its related practices are disclosed in Note 41 Audit and other services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Financial Report.\n\nThe Voting Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Act for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 the BAC has reviewed a summary of non-audit services provided by PwC, including details of the amounts paid or payable, and has provided written advice to the Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 the operation of the Consolidated Entity's Auditor Independence Policy , restricts the external auditor from providing non-audit services under which the auditor assumes the role of management, becomes an advocate for the Consolidated Entity, audits its own professional expertise, or creates a mutual or conflicting interest between the auditor and the Consolidated Entity. The policy also provides that significant permissible non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditor must be approved in advance by the Board Audit Committee (BAC) or the BAC Chairman, as appropriate\n\nConsistent with the advice of the BAC, the Voting Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services during the year by the auditor and its related practices is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Act.",

We are mindful of the challenges faced by many due to the ongoing impact of the pandemic and amid uncertain geopolitical and market conditions.\n\nWe remain guided by our core principles and purpose of 'empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future'.

        "page_content": "## Review of the remuneration framework\n\nOur longstanding approach to remuneration has been a key driver of our sustained success. Staff are rewarded based on their performance against a range of financial and non-financial considerations, delivering positive outcomes over the long-term for our clients, shareholders, partners and communities. Nevertheless, we continue to review and adjust our approach to ensure that the remuneration framework remains fit for purpose and balances the evolving expectations of all our stakeholders.\n\nDuring the year, the Board reviewed all structural components of the remuneration framework, taking into account a range of perspectives. As economies emerge from the pandemic, we are seeing a highly competitive global market where businesses are struggling to attract and retain key talent. This dynamic is continuing into FY2023. Macquarie has not been immune to this market-wide challenge, which has impacted voluntary turnover levels and our ability to fill open roles. We have also reviewed the remuneration framework against the expectations of shareholders and regulators, including APRA's new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511).\n\nFollowing a comprehensive review, the Board approved several changes to fine-tune our approach. The Board considers that the revised remuneration arrangements remain consistent with our remuneration principles and longstanding approach while responding to a broad range of expectations.\n\nThe key structural changes to be implemented in a phased approach include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes to the release of retained profit share on termination from FY2023. For profit share allocations made to EDs from FY2023, where the Board exercises its discretion to accelerate vesting on termination, the six-month release point post-termination will be removed. Amounts that would have vested after six months will now be released after 12 months and amounts that would have vested after 12 months will now be released after 24 months\n- \u00b7 changes to the malus framework from FY2022 which was last amended in 2015. The group of employees who will be subject to malus is expanded to include all Executive Directors (EDs). The events that may trigger the application of the malus provisions were also expanded and aligned to CPS 511 and the expectations of other global regulators\n- \u00b7 increases to fixed remuneration levels for FY2024. Fixed remuneration will be increased for the CEO and Executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) but will remain low relative to the industry and as a proportion of total remuneration\n- \u00b7 changes to profit share retention and vesting arrangements from FY2024. From FY2024, retention rates and vesting periods will be reduced for certain senior employees. For the CEO and Executive KMP, retention rates will be reduced by up to 10% and vesting periods will be shortened by two years, remaining long enough to appropriately consider the time horizons of risk. Upon retirement from Macquarie or redundancy, unvested retained profit share will no longer be accelerated and released over a two-year period, but instead will continue to vest on its original schedule (up to five years)\n\nFor the CEO and Executive KMP, whilst an increased proportion of remuneration will vest during employment, the above changes will remove the acceleration of unvested retention and extend the release period post-termination (in the case of redundancy or retirement from Macquarie).

For PSUs granted from FY2024 onwards, the vesting period will be extended by a year for the MGL CEO and the MBL CEO, to reflect regulatory expectations and increase the alignment to shareholders.\n\nFurther detail on these changes is provided on pages 99 to 100.\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes for FY2022\n\nThe Board spends considerable time each year assessing performance and determining remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Executive KMP. Mindful of the external focus on overall remuneration levels, and recognising the expectations and perspectives of all stakeholders, the Board has considered a range of factors critical to Macquarie's ongoing success.\n\nIn addition to considering the financial results of Macquarie overall as well as each Operating Group, the Board continues to focus on non-financial considerations to ensure senior management are accountable for their decisions, behaviours and associated risk management, customer and reputational consequences.\n\nThe Board's determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2022 for the CEO and Executive KMP reflect the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the strong leadership of the CEO and the whole Executive Committee demonstrating both an alignment to our purpose and ongoing resilience to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- \u00b7 record profits and strong financial performance while delivering sound customer/client and community outcomes across all four businesses\n- \u00b7 increased cross-collaboration across Macquarie, including strategic initiatives to reflect the evolving environment in climate solutions and energy transition\n- \u00b7 the continued investment in technology and digitalisation\n- \u00b7 continued focus on building a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment\n- \u00b7 role-modelling and encouragement of behaviours that support a strong risk culture\n- \u00b7 progress against the APRA remediation plan to strengthen the voice of the Bank\n- \u00b7 focus on regulatory engagement, in particular commitment to strengthening regulatory relationships, prudential compliance and governance across Macquarie\n- \u00b7 continued focus on Work Health and Safety (WHS) as a key priority to reduce the risk of serious injuries and fatalities across our activities. This priority will continue into FY2023\n- \u00b7 the management of financial and non-financial risks. During the year, there has been a strong focus on enhancements of risk capabilities and risk frameworks. While we have no systemic concerns, there have been risk management issues during the",

Our purpose and principles remain pivotal to our culture and effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward when making decisions that realise opportunities for the benefit of our clients, our shareholders, our people and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe BRC and the Board assess Macquarie's culture in many ways, including through staff survey results, human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture and incident reporting as well as through personal observation of management and staff behaviours and actions.\n\nRisk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand that they are rewarded for their performance, including the identification and management of risk, and that there are consequences for non-compliance with Macquarie's behavioural expectations.\n\nIn FY2022, there were 82 (FY2021: 97) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences including termination of employment or formal warning and a downward adjustment to profit share. Consistent with prior years, further details regarding these matters are disclosed on page 109.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Fees\n\nDuring the year the aggregate MGL and MBL Board member base fees were increased from $A260,000 to $A275,000, and the combined MGL and MBL Board Chair fee was increased from $A890,000 to $A935,000. Board Committee fees were also increased by approximately 5-7%. The fee increases were effective 1 July 2021 and reflect the increasing complexity, time commitment and regulatory focus of both MGL and MBL. Board base fees were last increased in July 2018 and Board Committee fees in October 2015.

The Board recognises that to achieve these objectives, we must attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise, align their interests with shareholders to meet the needs of clients and customers and ensure that the spirit and intent of regulatory requirements are upheld. This broad approach has been in place since Macquarie's inception and is reviewed regularly to ensure the framework continues to meet our remuneration objectives and aligns with the expectations of our stakeholders. As a result of this year's review, agreed changes to the remuneration structure are set out on pages 99 to 100.\n\nOur remuneration approach has been a key driver of our sustained success as an international organisation. Staff are motivated to grow businesses over the medium to long-term, taking accountability for all decisions and their accompanying risk management, customer, economic and reputational consequences.\n\nThis approach has been fundamental in ensuring we can continue to attract, motivate and retain exceptional, entrepreneurial and ethical people across the global markets in which we operate. We hire world-class people in 33 highly competitive markets. These people come from, and compete in, various industry sectors (including hedge funds, private equity firms, global investment banks, fund managers, advisory boutiques, commodity houses and other banks, as well as industries that are not specific to banking or financial services, for example, technology, accounting, and engineering) across many jurisdictions.\n\nThe table below shows the link between our purpose and our remuneration objectives and principles.\n\n## Our purpose:\n\n## Empowering people to innovate and invest for a better future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRemuneration objectives\n\nRemuneration principles\n\nMacquarie's remuneration framework aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 attract, motivate and retain exceptional people with deep industry expertise\n- \u00b7 deliver strong company performance over the short and long-term whilst prudently managing risk\n- \u00b7 align the interests of staff and shareholders to deliver sustained results for our customers, clients and community\n- \u00b7 drive behaviours that reflect our culture and the principles of What We Stand For\n- \u00b7 promote innovation and the building of sustainable businesses\n- \u00b7 foster a diverse and inclusive work environment.\n\nThese objectives are achieved by:\n\n- \u00b7 determining an individual's variable remuneration based on a range of financial and non-financial factors\n- \u00b7 emphasising performance-based remuneration\n- \u00b7 retaining a significant proportion of performance-based remuneration to enable risk outcomes to be considered over a long period\n- \u00b7 remunerating high-performing staff appropriately, relative to global peers\n- \u00b7 delivering retained profit share in equity to ensure the interests of staff and shareholders are aligned over the long-term\n- \u00b7 providing consistent arrangements over time to give staff the confidence to pursue multi-year initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntegrity",

During the year, to address both regulatory requirements under APRA's new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration (CPS 511) and the evolving expectations of our stakeholders, the Board undertook a holistic review of all structural components of the remuneration framework to ensure that they are delivering on a broad range of objectives. As part of this review, the BRC considered diverse perspectives, including those of shareholders and regulators, as well as global peer group benchmarking and increased global competition for talent in many of Macquarie's areas of activity.\n\nThe following changes to the remuneration framework have been approved by the Board and are being implemented in a phased approach from FY2022. The Board believes that the revised arrangements are consistent with our longstanding remuneration principles and allow for ongoing attraction, motivation, retention and accountability of talent,

Outcomes may be adjusted downwards at any level as a result of any risk management, compliance and conduct issues that have been identified during the year.\n\n## Individual profit share allocations\n\nIndividual profit share allocations reflect an employee's performance against their objectives, which are formally assessed annually. Permanent employees are required to have at least one formal Year in Review with their manager each year.

        "page_content": "## Retained profit share: retention and vesting\n\nA percentage of each individual's annual profit share allocation is retained (retained profit share) above certain thresholds. This is invested in a combination of Macquarie ordinary shares under the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP) and Macquarie-managed fund equity notionally invested under the Directors' Profit Share (DPS) Plan. (3) While they are employed, an individual's retained profit share vests and is released over a period that reflects the scope and nature of their role and responsibilities. (4) These arrangements ensure that Macquarie continues to retain high-performing staff, provide significant long-term alignment to shareholders and customers, as well as enabling risk outcomes to be considered over long periods.\n\nRetention and vesting arrangements are determined by the BRC according to prevailing market conditions, remuneration trends, and compliance with regulatory requirements (including under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR)). For each year's allocation, once the vesting period has been determined it remains fixed for that allocation.\n\nThe table below summarises the standard retention and vesting arrangements applicable for FY2022. These vesting periods do not include the performance year but begin following the date remuneration is awarded.\n\n## FY2022 standard profit share retention and vesting arrangements\n\n| Role                                     | Profit share retention (%)   | Vesting and release of profit share   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| CEO                                      | 80                           | One-fifth in each of years 3-7        |\n| MBL CEO                                  | 60                           | One-fifth in each of years 3-7        |\n| Executive Committee members              | 60                           | One-fifth in each of years 3-7        |\n| Designated Executive Directors           | 50                           | One-fifth in each of years 3-7        |\n| Executive Directors                      | 40                           | One-third in each of years 3-5        |\n| Staff other than Executive Directors (6) | 25-60                        | One-third in each of years 2-4        |\n\nThe Board's discretion to change remuneration arrangements, as noted above, includes changes to profit share retention levels provided that the retention percentage is at least 30% for all Executive Directors.\n\n## Investment of retained profit share\n\nAn individual's retained profit share is invested in a combination of Macquarie ordinary shares under the MEREP and Macquarie-managed fund equity notionally invested under the DPS Plan.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nContinued\n\nIn addition to the arrangements set out in the tables above, different arrangements may apply in certain circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 in limited circumstances, retained profit share may be allocated under arrangements other than the DPS Plan or the MEREP. For example, this may include investment in funds or products of a specific business group where there is a need to directly align the interests of staff with those of their clients.\n- \u00b7 retention rates and vesting and release schedules may vary for certain groups of staff who have become employees as a result of an acquisition, or for staff in certain jurisdictions, for example in the UK or European Union (EU), to ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements\n\n## Forfeiture of retained profit share - malus and clawback\n\nThe Board or its delegate has the ability to reduce or eliminate unvested retained profit share for certain senior employees (including all Executive Directors) in certain circumstances (malus), as set out on page 108. For certain employees identified in the UK or EU, the Board also has the ability to recover (in whole or in part) vested profit share (clawback).\n\n## Early vesting and release of retained profit share\n\nThe standard policy is that staff who cease employment with Macquarie will forfeit their unvested retained profit share. The Board may exercise discretion to accelerate the vesting of a departing employee's retained profit share and reduce the retention period including where, for example, their employment ends in the case of retirement from Macquarie, redundancy, death, serious incapacitation, disability, or serious ill-health. The Board's discretion to accelerate the vesting of retained profit share under these circumstances is subject to the conditions of early release as set out below for Executive Directors.\n\nDiscretion may be exercised in certain other limited exceptional circumstances on the grounds of business efficacy, in relation to strategic business objectives, including in connection with the divestment or internalisation of Macquarie businesses, or when an employee resigns to fulfil a public service role in a governmental organisation or agency. Where such discretion is exercised, the Board may impose such other conditions as it considers appropriate. This year, such discretion has been exercised and retained profit share was approved to be released for two executives due to the transfer of their employment to operationally segregated subsidiaries.\n\n## Conditions of early release to departing Executive Directors - Post Employment Events\n\nWhere discretion has been exercised to accelerate the vesting of retained profit share, the Board may reduce or eliminate their retained profit share if it is determined that the Executive Director has, at any time during their employment or the relevant release periods after their employment, committed a Malus Event (as set out on page 108) or:\n\n- (a) taken staff to a competitor of Macquarie or been instrumental in causing staff to go to a competitor, or\n- (b) joined a competitor of Macquarie or otherwise participated in a business that competes with Macquarie.\n\nEach of the above is a Post Employment Event.\n\nIn the case of death or serious incapacitation, the Board will typically accelerate the vesting of retained profit share and immediately release it. In other circumstances, the release will occur over the period from six months to two years after the Executive Director leaves, in accordance with the following table:\n\n|                                                               | First Period                                                    | Second Period                                                                                               | Third Period                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Time post-departure                                           | Six months                                                      | Six months to one year                                                                                      | One year to two years                                                                                                |\n| Unvested retained  profit share released                      | From all but the last two  years of employment                  | From the second year prior to the end  of employment                                                        | From the year prior to the end of  employment                                                                        |\n| Subject to                                                    | No Malus Event or Post  Employment Event as set  out previously | No Malus Event or Post Employment  Event during the First Period, and                                       | No Malus Event or Post Employment Event  during the First Period, and                                                |\n| Subject to                                                    | No Malus Event or Post  Employment Event as set  out previously | No Malus Event or Post Employment  Event (a) above during Second Period                                     | No Malus Event or Post Employment Event  (a) during the Second Period, and                                           |\n| Subject to                                                    | No Malus Event or Post  Employment Event as set  out previously | No Malus Event or Post Employment  Event (a) above during Second Period                                     | No Malus Event during the Third Period                                                                               |\n| Where the release is by  reason of retirement  from Macquarie | As above                                                        | As above and in addition, the release is  subject to no Post Employment Event  (b) during the Second Period | As above and in addition, the release is  subject to no Post Employment Event  (b) during the Second or Third Period |\n\nIn addition to the above, for Accountable Persons, the exercise of discretion for any early release of retained profit share will be subject to Macquarie meeting the minimum deferral periods required under the BEAR.\n\nWhere an Executive Director has a tax liability on termination of employment in respect of any unvested retained profit share, the Board has discretion to release unvested retained profit share up to an amount equal to the Executive Director's tax liability at an earlier time than noted above.",

As such, they provide an additional incentive to Executive Committee members to drive company-wide performance over the long-term and beyond their business group responsibilities. PSU awards are a meaningful incentive but are generally not the major element of an Executive Committee member's total remuneration.\n\nIndividual allocations are based on their role as members of the Executive Committee and their contribution to driving the collective performance of Macquarie, including their collaboration across businesses.\n\nPSUs are granted in August each year, after Macquarie's Annual General Meeting (AGM), in respect of the previous financial year. The number of PSUs to be allocated is calculated by dividing the face value of the award by the price of Macquarie ordinary shares on or around the date of grant.\n\nSince their introduction, PSUs have been structured as DSUs with performance hurdles. Holders have no right to dividend equivalent payments. There is no exercise price for PSUs.\n\n## Performance hurdles\n\nThe following table summarises the key terms of PSUs and the performance hurdles for FY2022:\n\n|                     | EPS CAGR hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | ROE hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Application         | 50% of PSU award                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 50% of PSU award                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Performance measure | Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in EPS over the  vesting period (four years) (9)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Average annual ROE over the vesting period  (four years) (9)  relative to a reference group of global  financial institutions.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nContinued\n\n## Rationale for hurdles\n\nThe PSU hurdles are annually reviewed by the BRC to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC's review includes consideration of the most relevant performance metrics to be used as hurdles as well as the levels at which the hurdles are achieved. The international reference group used for the ROE hurdle is also reviewed to determine whether our comparators remain suitable for Macquarie's diversified business interests and global footprint. The BRC also considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance bodies, shareholders and regulators, as well as market practice. In the FY2022 annual review, both the relative ROE and absolute EPS hurdles were considered to still be appropriate for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 the approach is consistent with that advocated by APRA in not using TSR as a measure\n- \u00b7 ROE and EPS growth drive long-term shareholder value and are appropriate as the Executive Committee can affect outcomes on both measures. In contrast, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is influenced by many external factors over which executives have limited control\n- \u00b7 ROE and EPS can be substantiated using information that is disclosed in Macquarie's annual reports\n- \u00b7 the hurdles are designed to reward sustained strong performance and are relatively well-insulated from short-term fluctuations. The time frame used for PSUs should also be considered in light of the three to seven-year deferral of profit share for members of the Executive Committee\n- \u00b7 a sliding scale diversifies the risk of not achieving the hurdles and provides rewards proportionate to performance for shareholders and is preferable to an all-or-nothing test, which some have argued could promote excessive risk-taking\n- \u00b7 the EPS targets are confirmed as rigorous when market performance is considered, with the EPS threshold hurdle exceeding the performance of most of the ASX 20, global reference group and relevant indices over time\n- \u00b7 the ROE vesting thresholds and sliding scale are in line with the domestic market and are particularly challenging when compared to international practice.\n- \u00b7 for the EPS element to fully vest, Macquarie needs to achieve at least 12% CAGR over the vesting period. Supporting the rigour of the hurdle, cumulative EPS growth of 57% over four years is required to achieve full vesting\n\nThe charts below display Macquarie's historical EPS and ROE PSU outcomes, highlighting that since their introduction in 2009, 55% of the EPS tranches and 50% of the ROE tranches have resulted in either no vesting or partial vesting.\n\n## Historical EPS tranche outcomes\n\n## Historical ROE tranche outcomes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Use of an international reference group\n\nAn international reference group recognises the extent of Macquarie's diversification and internationalisation. As at 31 March 2022, total international income represented approximately 75% of Macquarie's total income, with approximately 54% of Macquarie's staff located outside Australia. The BRC considers an international reference group to be appropriate on the basis that:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie has no comparable Australian-listed peers.\n- \u00b7 the international reference group is currently most representative of Macquarie's business operations and talent pool. These firms broadly operate in the same markets and in similar business segments, and compete for the same people as Macquarie\n\nIn addition, the BRC considers it important to not intervene reactively to remove under-performers or over-performers in any given period. An organisation's period of under-performance is generally followed by a period of over-performance.",

Our purpose and principles effectively guide our staff in balancing risk and reward and making decisions that realise opportunity for the benefit of our clients, shareholders, partners and the communities in which we operate. Staff are continually made aware that these principles must form the basis of all behaviours and actions. These behavioural expectations are outlined in the Board approved Code of Conduct , which is actively promoted by management and cascaded through the organisation through multiple mechanisms. Macquarie invests significant time and effort in communicating and reinforcing Macquarie's culture through communications from senior management, policy reminders, training, and learning and development activities. The Board is able to assess Macquarie's culture in a number of ways including through staff survey results, human capital reporting, strategy presentations, risk culture reports, consequence management reports as well as through personal observation of management, and staff behaviour and actions.\n\nStrong risk management is a fundamental part of everyone's role at Macquarie. Staff understand they are rewarded not just for their contribution to financial results, but also for how those results are achieved. This includes an assessment of an individual's approach to managing risk, and their alignment to the What We Stand For principles. They understand there are potential consequences for non-compliance with the risk management framework and Macquarie's behavioural expectations. Staff training and communications emphasise the link between risk, conduct, policy breaches and consequence management outcomes, including, where appropriate, adjustments to performance-based remuneration.\n\n## Alignment of remuneration with risk outcomes\n\nThe Board considers that the effective alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking is fundamental to its remuneration approach. The consideration of risk is embedded throughout the entire remuneration process including through the determination of individual profit share allocations, business and company-wide profit share pools as well as through the way in which remuneration is structured and delivered.\n\nThe Board is aware of the increasing focus of regulators and shareholders on ensuring risk-related matters that come to light subsequent to remuneration being awarded are appropriately factored into remuneration decisions. Macquarie's retention and vesting arrangements provide a mechanism for the Board to consider risk outcomes over a long period. Furthermore, where an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter that may result in forfeiture or, for senior employees, the application of malus, Macquarie may further defer the payment, vesting and/or release of profit share to allow for the investigation to be completed.",

This includes staff in the UK and EU who are subject to additional malus and clawback provisions under local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe BRC considers whether, and the extent to which, to apply malus, taking into account local employment laws, the nature and circumstances of the event and any other redress that has been or may be applied.",

These processes may result in a downward adjustment to group and/or individual profit share allocations where appropriate.

There are a number of processes in place to ensure consistency (across business groups and staff levels) in the application of consequences and the determination of remuneration outcomes, including the review and challenge by senior management of consequence management outcomes for consistency at year end.\n\nWhere an investigation has commenced into a risk or conduct-related matter, vesting, payment and/or release of profit share (including available and/or retained amounts) to an employee may be deferred to allow for the investigation to be completed.\n\n## Consequence management outcomes\n\nMacquarie's Consequence Management Guideline applies wherever a breach of internal policy or regulatory requirement is identified. Consequences may include further training, removal of delegated authorities or permissions, adjustments to performance-based remuneration, impact on promotion, formal warnings or termination.\n\nWhere an employee has received a formal warning, their performance-based remuneration is subject to further review and in some cases, it will be reduced to zero. Promotion decisions may also be impacted. Impacts may also be applied where a formal warning has not been issued. In each case, judgement is exercised as to the appropriate consequence(s) based on all the relevant circumstances.\n\nIn FY2022, there were 82 (FY2021: 97) matters involving conduct or policy breaches that resulted in formal consequences. These included 38 (FY2021: 45) Code of Conduct or appropriate workplace behaviour related matters and 44 (FY2021: 52) other policy matters including risk management and technology breaches. Of the 82:\n\n- \u00b7 for 53 matters, a formal warning was issued (FY2021: 81). Additional consequences were applied as appropriate including additional training, removal of delegated authorities or permissions, adjustments to profit share and/or impact to promotion (12 have resulted in individuals subsequently leaving Macquarie before year-end outcomes were determined and 40 individuals had their profit share reduced by an average of 44%).\n- \u00b7 for 29 matters, termination of employment was the outcome (FY2021: 16)\n\nThe 82 matters were considered isolated incidents and there was no evidence of broader systemic conduct issues.",

        "page_content": "## Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2022\n\nThis section details the process for determining Executive KMP remuneration outcomes for FY2022 and demonstrates the link between pay and performance.\n\n## Executive KMP fixed remuneration outcomes\n\nIn line with our pay for performance approach to remuneration, fixed remuneration for our Executive KMP in FY2022 comprised approximately 8% of total awarded remuneration, with the balance at risk and explicitly linked to performance.\n\nMr Cassidy and Mr Green were appointed to the Executive Committee during FY2022. To reflect their new roles, their fixed remuneration has been increased, effective 1 April 2022. There are no fixed remuneration increases for other Executive KMP for FY2023, however as noted in the letter from the Chair, fixed remuneration levels will be increased from 1 April 2023.\n\n## Process to determine Executive KMP profit share outcomes\n\nThere is a consistent and comprehensive process for the Board and the BRC to assess the performance of the CEO and each Executive KMP during the year to enable them to determine remuneration outcomes at the end of the year. The Board is always mindful of the external focus on overall remuneration levels and has spent considerable time determining remuneration outcomes. The BRC recognises the range of expectations and has made decisions that take into consideration the perspectives of all stakeholders. Significant judgement is applied to ensure that remuneration outcomes are aligned both with individual and company-wide performance and with outcomes delivered to our shareholders, our clients and the communities in which we operate.\n\nAs part of the Board's annual review of Macquarie's CEO's performance, the CEO meets with the Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) of the Board towards the end of the financial year to consider formal documentation that outlines her views of Macquarie's performance. The presentation includes a broad range of Macquarie's activities covering the following main areas:\n\n- \u00b7 risk management and compliance\n- \u00b7 financial performance\n- \u00b7 business leadership including customer and community outcomes\n- \u00b7 people leadership and professional conduct consistent with the Code of Conduct and the principles of What We Stand For.\n\nOver the course of the year the Board receives regular reports and updates on many of these areas. These are summarised in the CEO's presentation, together with additional information on matters of interest the Board has identified for further discussion as a part of the review process. This year, the NEDs requested that the CEO focus on major strategic, risk and business initiatives as well as the management of prudential and regulatory obligations. The Board then considers the CEO's performance and progress against all of these topics in determining the CEO's remuneration for the year. A similar process is followed for the CEO of Macquarie Bank focussed on MBL-specific measures.\n\nThe Board and the BRC review formal documentation for each Executive KMP, which includes consideration of the same factors as the CEO as set out above.\n\nThe BRC also consider risk-related matters raised in the independent reports from the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit. To ensure all matters are appropriately brought to the BRC's attention and to achieve an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management, there is a joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and the BGCC.\n\nFinally, the BRC considers remuneration levels for organisations that broadly operate in the same markets and compete for the same people as Macquarie.\n\n## FY2022 Executive KMP profit share outcomes\n\nFY2022 remuneration outcomes reflect:\n\n- \u00b7 the recognition that our people are our greatest asset, and the importance of retaining key people to encourage innovation and pursue growth opportunities\n- \u00b7 this year's achievements against a range of financial and non-financial factors, some of which are discussed below\n- \u00b7 an alignment to the outcomes delivered to shareholders\n- \u00b7 risk management, compliance and conduct outcomes.\n\nThe Board's determination of remuneration outcomes for FY2022 for the CEO and Executive KMP reflect the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the strong leadership of the CEO and the whole Executive Committee demonstrating both an alignment to our purpose and ongoing resilience to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic\n- \u00b7 record profits and strong financial performance while delivering sound customer/client and community outcomes across all four businesses\n- \u00b7 increased cross-collaboration across Macquarie, including strategic initiatives to reflect the evolving environment in climate solutions and energy transition\n- \u00b7 the continued investment in technology and digitalisation\n- \u00b7 continued focus on building a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment\n- \u00b7 role-modelling of and encouragement of behaviours that support a strong risk culture\n- \u00b7 progress against the APRA remediation plan to strengthen the voice of the Bank. This incorporates the programs of work across governance, remuneration, risk culture, regulatory reporting, prudential risk management, and group structure\n- \u00b7 focus on regulatory engagement, in particular commitment to strengthening regulatory relationships, prudential compliance and governance across Macquarie\n- \u00b7 continued focus on WHS as a key priority to reduce the risk of serious injuries and fatalities across our activities. This priority will continue into FY2023",

During the year, there has been a strong focus on enhancements of risk capabilities and risk frameworks. While we have no systemic concerns, there have been risk management issues during the year for which we have imposed remuneration impacts to the MGL CEO, the MBL CEO and relevant Executive KMP.\n\nExecutive KMP remuneration outcomes have been considered in the context of the wider workforce. The BRC receives extensive reporting on remuneration outcomes and individually reviews and approves the remuneration of Accountable Persons, staff who hold regulated roles, Designated Executive Directors (generally direct reports of Executive KMP) and other senior staff, and has reviewed overall total remuneration levels across each business to ensure appropriate distribution of remuneration across the organisation. The BRC has also considered the compensation expense to income ratio as a guide as to whether the share of profits distributed to staff and shareholders is reasonable.\n\nAfter careful consideration of all these factors, we believe the following outcomes for the year are appropriate:\n\n- \u00b7 total Executive KMP awarded profit share of $A123.82 million (up 16% on the prior year)\n- \u00b7 CEO awarded profit share has increased 26% on the prior year to $A25.0 million\n- \u00b7 PSU allocations of $A4.0 million for the CEO and ranging from $A1.4 million to $A2.8 million for Executive KMP.\n\n## CEO awarded profit share (21)\n\n## Total Executive KMP awarded profit share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## New Executive Committee member\n\nThe Board recognises that it is vital to secure the best executive talent. In January 2022, we were pleased to welcome Evie Bruce to Macquarie in the role of incoming General Counsel. Ms Bruce was subsequently appointed to the Executive Committee on 2 March 2022.\n\nTo secure Ms Bruce's appointment, the Board determined it was necessary and appropriate to provide competitive remuneration arrangements, with consideration of internal peers and external market comparators. This included awarding minimum profit share allocations of $A0.7 million and $A2.6 million for the performance years ending 31 March 2022 and 2023, respectively. The profit share allocations will be subject to Macquarie's standard remuneration arrangements, including the retention, forfeiture, and release conditions as set out on pages 103 to 104 of the Remuneration Report. Ms Bruce will also receive a minimum PSU allocation of face value $A2.0 million for FY2023, subject to the performance hurdles and other conditions applicable to the PSU allocations awarded to other Executive Committee members.\n\nTo demonstrate the alignment between pay and performance, the following graphs show the multi-year alignment between CEO and total Executive KMP awarded profit share and Macquarie NPAT over a ten-year period.",

The key elements of Macquarie's remuneration governance framework are described below.\n\n## MGL AND MBL BOARDS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Board Remuneration Committee                                                           | Board Risk Committee, Board Audit Committee  & Board Governance and Compliance Committee                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oversees remuneration policies and practices,  and makes recommendations to the Boards | Discuss any relevant matters that may impact remuneration in a  joint meeting with the Board Remuneration Committee |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong Board oversight\n\nThe Board oversees Macquarie's remuneration framework. The Board has a BRC whose objective is to assist the Board and the Board of Macquarie Bank with Macquarie's remuneration policies and practices. The BRC currently comprises four independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs):\n\n## Board Remuneration Committee\n\n| Chair          | Members     |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| J.R. Broadbent | P.M. Coffey |\n|                | M. Roche    |\n|                | P.H. Warne  |\n\nThe BRC members have the required experience and expertise in human resources, remuneration and risk to enable them to achieve effective governance of the remuneration framework. The BRC has a regular meeting cycle and met seven times during FY2022. Attendance at meetings by the BRC members is set out in the Directors' Report. Strict processes are in place to ensure conflicts of interest are appropriately managed.\n\n## BRC responsibilities\n\nThe BRC pays close attention to the design and operation of remuneration practices for all Macquarie staff, not just for the most senior executives. The responsibilities of the BRC are outlined in its Charter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Charter is available at macquarie.com/corporat e-governance\n\nSome of the responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 recommending to the Board the remuneration outcomes for all Executive KMP, Designated Executive Directors and other senior  executives\n- \u00b7 overseeing the process for the annual review by the Board of the CEOs' and other Executive KMPs' performance\n- \u00b7 assessing the effectiveness of the Remuneration Policy to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, as well as to support the alignment of remuneration with prudent risk-taking and professional conduct across the organisation\n- \u00b7 recommending the Remuneration Policy to the Board for approval.\n\n## Alignment to risk\n\nThe BRC liaises with the BRiC, BAC and BGCC to ensure there is effective co-ordination between the Committees to assist in producing an integrated approach to remuneration that reflects prudent and appropriate risk management.\n\nAs set out on page 109, the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit provide the BRC with independent reports detailing significant regulatory and legal matters, significant compliance and operational incidents, internal audit issues and other non-financial risk matters. A joint meeting of the BRC, BRiC, BAC and BGCC is held to discuss these matters, with the CRO and the Head of Internal Audit in attendance. The General Counsel attends as required to provide a further source of independent input, including on matters that might lead to a malus determination.\n\n## Engagement with external stakeholders\n\nThe Chairman of the Board and the BRC Chair undertook a series of meetings with investors and proxy advisors during the year to communicate our remuneration approach and to hear any concerns raised by the investor community.\n\nThey also engaged with APRA during the year as part of the development of Macquarie's implementation plan for the incoming requirements of CPS 511.",

Pay Governance has not made any remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). The BRC is responsible for making decisions within the terms of its Charter. Pay Governance's terms of engagement set out their independence from members of Macquarie's management. This year, Pay Governance:\n\n- \u00b7 considered alignment with shareholder interests\n- \u00b7 provided information on global remuneration and regulatory trends\n- \u00b7 compared individual remuneration for Executive KMP where relevant comparator company information was available\n- \u00b7 considered Macquarie's overall remuneration approach compared to comparator company organisations.\n\nPay Governance's findings included that:\n\n- \u00b7 Macquarie's remuneration components support its remuneration objectives and principles and are largely consistent with practices at other leading global investment banks, including that performance-based remuneration takes risk management into account.\n- \u00b7 the objectives of Macquarie's remuneration framework are similar to those cited by other leading global investment banks",

        "page_content": "## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe Macquarie Board seeks to attract and appoint high-calibre NEDs. Reflecting the Board's role, the remuneration arrangements applicable to NEDs, as outlined in this section, differ significantly from the arrangements applicable to Executives.\n\n## Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nNon-Executive Director fees are set acknowledging the level required to appropriately remunerate highly qualified NEDs who have the relevant skills and experience to govern as a member of the Board.\n\nMacquarie's NED remuneration framework seeks to remunerate high-calibre directors by:\n\n- \u00b7 setting Board and Committee fees to reflect the time commitment required to meet the responsibilities involved in the annual scheduled calendar, taking into account market rates for relevant organisations and market trends\n- \u00b7 setting an overall fee that reflects the scale and complexity of Macquarie, including risk management and regulatory responsibilities and the global financial nature of Macquarie's activities\n- \u00b7 paying separate fees for additional responsibilities that may arise on an ad hoc basis\n- \u00b7 setting a minimum shareholding requirement to align the interest of NEDs with shareholders.\n- \u00b7 delivering these fees in a form that is not contingent on Macquarie's performance\n\nMGL NEDs are also NEDs of MBL and the framework governs the remuneration of NEDs of MGL and MBL. The CEO is not remunerated separately for acting as an Executive Voting Director.\n\nUnlike Macquarie executives, NEDs are not granted equity, nor are they eligible to receive profit share payments. There are no termination payments to NEDs on their retirement from office other than payments relating to their accrued superannuation contributions comprising part of their remuneration.\n\nNEDs may elect to receive their remuneration, in part, in the form of superannuation contributions over and above the minimum level of contribution required under applicable legislation.\n\nMacquarie's NEDs are remunerated for their services from the maximum aggregate amount approved by shareholders for this purpose. Macquarie shareholders approved the current limit ($A5.0 million per annum) at MGL's 2019 AGM. The Board ensures that NED remuneration for MGL NEDs, including any fees for being a member of the MBL Board does not exceed this shareholder approved maximum amount.\n\nBoard and Committee fees are reviewed annually. (28) The Board has reviewed NED remuneration in the context of external market factors, including trend and peer analysis of Australian and international comparator groups. Having regard to this analysis and to address the increasing demands on NEDs given the growth in the scale of Macquarie's operations and regulatory initiatives that have increased the responsibilities and time commitment of NEDs, particularly as regards MBL, the Board determined to increase the aggregate Macquarie and Macquarie Bank Board member base fees from $A260,000 to $A275,000 and increase Board Committee fees by approximately 5-7%. The combined Macquarie and Macquarie Bank annual Board Chairman fee was also increased from $A890,000 to $A935,000. The fee increases were effective from 1 July 2021.\n\nBoard base fees were last increased in July 2018 and Board Committee fees in October 2015. Over the last five-year period from 2016-2017 to 2021-2022, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the average non-Chairman Board member remuneration was about 1.1% pa and the CAGR of the Board Chairman's remuneration was about 1.6% pa.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement for Non-Executive Directors\n\nTo align the interests of the Board with shareholders, the Board has a minimum shareholding requirement for NEDs, who are required to have a meaningful direct shareholding in Macquarie.\n\nThe Board minimum shareholding requirement:\n\n- \u00b7 for the Chairman, is an investment equivalent to one times the annual Chair fee,\n- \u00b7 for NEDs other than the Chairman, is an investment equivalent to one times the average annual NED fee for the financial year ending prior to their appointment\n\nwith the minimum number of shares to be determined using the share price as at the date of a NED's/Chairman's appointment.\n\nThe above requirements apply to NEDs and are to be met within three years from appointment with one third of the requirement to be held after one year, two thirds after two years and in full after three years.\n\nUnder Macquarie's Trading Policy, NEDs may only trade Macquarie securities during designated trading windows and are prohibited from hedging shares held to meet this minimum Macquarie shareholding requirement. Each NED's current holding of Macquarie ordinary shares is included on page 84 of the Directors' Report.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nContinued\n\n## Additional information regarding the statutory remuneration disclosures set out in this Appendix\n\nThe remuneration disclosures set out in this Appendix have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and differ to the additional disclosures set out on pages 117 to 125.\n\nUnder the requirements of AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures, the remuneration disclosures for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 only include remuneration relating to the portion of the relevant periods that each person was an Executive KMP.\n\nThe following information provides more detail regarding some of the column headings in this Appendix:\n\n- (1) Short-term employee benefits:\n- (a) Salary : includes salary, superannuation, any accrual for long service leave and other benefits\n- (b) Performance-related remuneration : this represents the cash portion of each person's profit share allocation for the reporting period as an Executive KMP.\n\n## (2) Long-term employee benefits:\n\n- (a) Restricted profit share: this represents the amount of retained profit share awarded for the current period that is deferred to future periods and held as a notional investment in Macquarie-managed fund equity (DPS Plan)\n- (b) Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share: Profit share amounts retained under the DPS Plan are notionally invested in Macquarie-managed funds, providing Executive Directors with an economic exposure to the underlying investments. Executive Directors are each entitled to amounts equivalent to the investment earnings (dividends/distributions and security price appreciation) on the underlying securities. The notional returns are calculated based on Total Shareholder Return. Where these amounts are positive, they may be paid to Executive Directors and are included in these remuneration disclosures as part of 'Earnings on prior years' restricted profit share'. If there is a notional loss, this loss will be offset against any future notional income until the loss is completely offset and is reported as a negative amount in the same column. These earnings reflect the investment performance of the assets in which prior years' retained amounts have been notionally invested. Their inclusion in the individual remuneration disclosures on the previous pages may, therefore, cause distortions when year-on-year remuneration trends are examined. They do not reflect remuneration review decisions made about the individual's current year performance.\n\n## (3) Share-based payments:\n\n- (a) Equity awards including shares: This represents the current year expense for retained profit share that is invested in Macquarie ordinary shares under the MEREP as described on pages 103 to 104. This is recognised as an expense over the respective vesting periods, or service period if shorter, as described on pages 103 to 104 and includes amounts relating to prior years equity awards that have been previously disclosed. Equity awards in respect of FY2022 performance will be granted during FY2023; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2021. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2022 and the number of equity awards expected to vest. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each equity award when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period\n- (b) PSUs: This represents the current year expense for PSUs that is recognised over the vesting period as described on page 105. This includes amounts relating to prior years' PSU awards. PSU awards in respect of FY2022 will be granted during FY2023; however, Macquarie begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2021. The expense is estimated using the price of MGL ordinary shares as at 31 March 2022 and the number of PSUs expected to vest. The estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 2.91% per annum, expected vesting date of 1 July 2026, and a dividend yield of 3.63% per annum. In the following financial year, Macquarie will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of the accounting fair value for each PSU when granted and will use this validation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. Performance hurdles attached to the PSUs allow for PSUs to become exercisable upon vesting only when the relevant performance hurdles are met. The current year expense is reduced for previously recognised remuneration expense where performance hurdles have not been met, have been partially met or are not expected to be met.",

Grants made to Executive KMP prior to their joining the Executive Committee are not disclosed. PSUs are disclosed in a separate table.\n\nA significant portion of an Executive KMP's retained profit share is invested in Macquarie equity, delivered as RSUs or DSUs. RSUs are units comprising a beneficial interest in Macquarie ordinary shares held in a trust for the staff member. DSUs are structured to provide the holder with the same benefits and risks of RSU holders. For further details, refer to Note 32 Employee equity participation to the financial statements in the Financial Report. There have been no alterations to the terms or conditions of the grants set out below since the grant date. RSU and DSU awards are subject to forfeiture as set out on page 104. The maximum potential value of unvested awards could vary significantly and is dependent on the MGL ordinary share price at the time of vesting. Retention rates, the vesting profiles and service and performance criteria for the current year are set out on pages 103 to 104.

The accounting fair value of such grants is being amortised and disclosed as part of each KMP's remuneration on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The 2021 PSU allocation has been determined based on a face value methodology. The accounting fair value of $A134.04 at this date has been estimated using a discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe following key assumptions were adopted in determining the value of the PSUs granted:\n\n| Interest rate to maturity   | 0.5291% per annum   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Expected vesting dates      | 1 July 2025         |\n| Dividend yield              | 3.73% per annum     |\n\nPSUs have a nil exercise price. PSUs awarded from FY2020 vest in four years as set out on page 105 while PSUs awarded prior to FY2020 vest on a pro-rata basis as set out on page 105, footnote 9. For the 2021 grant, it will vest on 1 July 2025. The PSUs expire on 3 August 2030.",

Consequently, this Financial Report is compliant with IFRS.\n\n## (ii) Basis of measurement\n\nThis Financial Report has been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the following items, as disclosed in the respective accounting policy:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets and liabilities that are otherwise measured on an amortised cost basis but adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged in qualifying fair value hedge relationships\n- \u00b7 financial instruments (including derivatives) required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments that have been designated as FVTPL (DFVTPL)\n- \u00b7 non-current assets and disposal groups that have been classified as held for sale and where a disposal group has been impaired to its fair value less costs to sell\n- \u00b7 certain other non-financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, such as investment property.\n- \u00b7 commodity inventories that are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption\n\n## (iii) Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of this Financial Report in compliance with Australian Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The notes to the financial statements set out areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated Financial Report such as:\n\n- \u00b7 determining the appropriate business model for a group of financial assets which includes determining the level at which the business model condition is applied and whether past or expected sales activity is consistent with a held to collect business model (Note 44(vii))\n\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the cash flows generated by a financial asset constitute solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) may require the application of judgement, particularly for certain subordinated or non-recourse positions, and in the determination of whether compensation for early termination of a contract is reasonable (Note 44(vii))\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures and investment in subsidiaries, including the reversal thereof (Note 44(i), Note 44(xxii), Note 14 and Note 17)\n- \u00b7 choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of Expected Credit Loss, including the determination of significant increase in credit risk (SICR), forecasts of economic conditions and the weightings assigned thereto (Note 44(xxii) and Note 13)\n- \u00b7 timing and amount of impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and, where applicable, the reversal thereof (Note 44(xxii) and Note 16)\n- \u00b7 distinguishing between whether assets or a business is acquired under a business combination, particularly the determination of whether a substantive process exists that, together with an integrated set of activities and assets, significantly contributes to the ability to create an output (Note 44(ii))\n- \u00b7 fair value of assets and liabilities including the determination of non-recurring fair values and accounting for day 1 profits or losses for financial instruments (Note 44(vii), Note 44(x) and Note 38)\n- \u00b7 determination of significant influence over associates, joint control over arrangements and control over subsidiaries, including the assessment of whether certain rights are protective or substantive in nature, whether these rights are held in the capacity as agent or principal, and whether the level of involvement in an investee's relevant activities is sufficient to significantly affect the returns generated (Note 44(i))\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of certain revenue streams including performance fees from Macquarie-managed funds and other capital market investments and transactions (Note 44(iv))\n- \u00b7 recoverability of tax receivables, deferred tax assets and measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities can require significant judgement, particularly where the recoverability of such tax balances relies on the estimation of future taxable profits and management's determination of the likelihood that uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority (Note 44(vi), Note 4 and Note 18)\n- \u00b7 recognition and measurement of provisions related to actual and potential claims, determination of contingent liabilities (Note 44(iv), Note 44(xvii) and Note 33)\n- \u00b7 timing of derecognition of assets and liabilities following the disposal of an investment, including the measurement of the associated gain or loss (Note 44(i)).\n- \u00b7 application of hedge accounting principles, including the assessment that a forecast transaction is highly probable (Note 44(x) and Note 35)\n\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including reasonable expectations of future events.",

Actual results in the future may differ from those reported and it is therefore reasonably possible, on the basis of existing knowledge, that outcomes within the next financial year that are different from management's assumptions and estimates could require an adjustment to the carrying amounts of the reported assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\n## (iv) Coronavirus (COVID-19) impact\n\nThe Novel Coronavirus has had significant impacts on global economies and equity, debt and commodity markets, led to several changes in the economy and resulted in several support actions by financial markets, governments and regulators. The impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve and, where applicable, has been incorporated into the determination of the Consolidated Entity's results of operations and measurement of its assets and liabilities at the reporting date.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's processes to determine the impact of COVID-19 for these financial statements is consistent with the processes disclosed and applied in its 31 March 2021 and 30 September 2021 financial statements. Those processes identified that expected credit losses (Note 13) required continued judgement as a result of the impact of COVID-19.\n\nAs there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty associated with these assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ to those forecasted which may impact the accounting estimates included in these financial statements. Other than adjusting events that provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period, the impact of events that arise after the reporting period will be accounted for in future reporting periods.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity drew down an additional $9.5 billion from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) under the Term Funding Facility (TFF) during the reporting period. As at 31 March 2022, the Consolidated Entity had drawn $11.3 billion under the TFF which is in the form of repurchase agreements, is collateralised with issued loan notes in the Consolidated Entity's home loans' securitisation vehicles. The objective of the TFF is to reduce interest rates for borrowers and support businesses during this period through lending.\n\n## (v) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and interpretations that are either effective in the current financial year or have been early adopted\n\nThe amendments made to existing standards that were mandatorily effective or have been early adopted for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 April 2021 did not result in a material impact on this Financial Report. There were no new Australian accounting standards that were mandatorily effective or have been early adopted for the Financial Report.\n\n## (vi) Other developments\n\n## IBOR reform: Transition from inter-bank offered rates (IBOR) to alternative reference rates (ARRs)\n\nIBOR interest rate benchmarks, that are used in a wide variety of financial instruments such as derivatives and lending arrangements, are undergoing reforms. Examples of IBOR include 'LIBOR' (the London Inter-bank Offered Rate), 'EURIBOR' (the Euro Inter-bank Offered Rate), 'CDOR' (the Canadian dollar offered rate) and 'BBSW' (the Australian Bank Bill Swap Rate). The nature of the reforms varies across different jurisdictions. For example, in Australia the existing IBOR benchmark (BBSW) has undergone reform and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future alongside the nominated ARR for AUD which is 'AONIA' (AUD Overnight Index Average). In Canada, the Canadian Alternate Reference Rate Working Group (CARR) has recommended to Refinitiv Benchmark Services UK Limited (Refinitiv), the administrator of CDOR, to cease publication of all of CDOR's remaining tenors after 30 June 2024. Refinitiv is yet to make a decision on the future of CDOR but expects to make an announcement in Q2 2022.\n\nAfter 31 December 2021, 24 of 35 LIBOR currency-tenor pairings were discontinued, 6 LIBOR switched to a modified calculation methodology (known as 'synthetic' LIBORs) and 5 USD LIBOR tenors are expected to cease publication after 30 June 2023. Aside from the ongoing exceptional use of USD LIBOR, the use of LIBOR in new contracts ceased by the end of 2021.\n\nIndustry working groups have worked with authorities and consulted with market participants to develop market practices that may be used to transition existing LIBOR-linked contracts for derivatives, loans, bonds and other financial instruments that mature beyond their respective LIBOR cessation dates, to ARRs. Amongst the issues considered were the key differences between LIBOR and ARRs. LIBOR are term rates which are quoted at the beginning of that period (for example, one-, three-, six-or twelve-month periods) and include a component of bank credit risk. ARRs on the other hand are overnight rates with little or no credit risk. To facilitate the transition of contracts from LIBOR to ARRs on an economically equivalent basis, adjustments for term and credit differences needs to be applied.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1\n\nBasis of preparation continued\n\n## (vi) Other developments continued\n\nAs a diversified financial services group with a variety of global products and services, IBOR reforms, including the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, are important changes for the Consolidated Entity.\n\n## Impacts on financial reporting\n\nAASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards Interest Rate Benchmark Reform , issued in October 2019, amended AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (AASB 7) and AASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) to provide certain relief from applying specific accounting requirements to hedge accounting relationships directly affected by IBOR reform. The relief enables the continuation of hedge accounting for impacted hedge relationships during the period of uncertainty prior to IBOR transition. The Consolidated Entity early adopted these amendments for the year ended 31 March 2020.\n\nIn August 2020, AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 amended standards including AASB 7, AASB 9 and AASB 16 Leases (AASB 16) to address accounting issues following the transition to ARR. The amendments provide certain relief from applying specific requirements related to hedge accounting and the modification of financial assets and financial liabilities if certain criteria are met.\n\nWhere modifications to a contract, or changes in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows under a contract, are necessitated as a direct consequence of IBOR reform and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis, the relief allows an entity to reset the yield applied to such an exposure on a prospective basis. Thus, at the time of modification, where the relief applies, there is no impact to the income statement. The relief requires continuation of hedge accounting in circumstances when changes to hedged items and hedging instruments arise as a result of changes required by the IBOR reform.\n\nThe amendments, which were mandatorily effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021, also require additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The Consolidated Entity early adopted these amendments for the year ended 31 March 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3 Segment reporting\n\n## (i) Operating segments\n\nAASB 8 Operating Segments requires the 'management approach' to disclosing information about the Consolidated Entity's reportable segments. The financial information is reported on the same basis as used internally by Senior Management for evaluating Operating Segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to Operating Segments. Such information may be produced using different measures to that used in preparing the statutory income statement.\n\nFor internal reporting, performance measurement and risk management purposes, the Consolidated Entity is divided into four Operating Groups and a Corporate segment (reportable segments).\n\nThe financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\nThese segments have been set up based on the different core products and services offered. The Operating Groups comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 BFS provides a diverse range of personal banking, wealth management, and business banking products and services to retail clients, advisers, brokers and business clients\n- \u00b7 MAM provides investment solutions to clients across a range of capabilities in Private Markets and Public Investments, including infrastructure, green investments, agriculture and natural assets, real estate, private credit, asset finance, equities, fixed income and multi-asset solutions\n- \u00b7 CGM is a global business offering capital and financing, risk management, market access, physical execution and logistics solutions to its diverse client base across Commodities, Financial Markets and Asset Finance\n- \u00b7 Macquarie Capital has global capability in advisory and capital raising services, investing alongside partners and clients across the capital structure, providing clients with specialist expertise, advice and flexible capital solutions across a range of sectors. It also has global capability in development and investment in infrastructure and energy projects and companies, with a focus on transport, digital and social infrastructure. Macquarie Capital's Equities brokerage business provides clients with access to equity research, sales, execution capabilities and corporate access.\n\nEffective 1 April 2022, the Green Investment Group (GIG) has transferred from Macquarie Capital and is operating as part of MAM, bringing together Macquarie's specialist capabilities to provide clients with greater access to green investment opportunities.\n\nThe Corporate segment, which is not considered an Operating Group, comprises head office and Central Service Groups, including Group Treasury, and holds certain legacy and strategic investments, assets and businesses that are not allocated to any of the Operating Groups.\n\nItems of income and expense within the Corporate segment include the net result of managing Macquarie's liquidity and funding requirements, earnings on capital and the residual accounting volatility relating to economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is applied, as well as accounting volatility for other economically hedged positions where hedge accounting is not applicable.\n\nOther items of income and expenses within the Corporate segment include earnings from investments, changes in central overlays to impairments or valuation of assets, unallocated head office costs and costs of Central Service Groups, the Consolidated Entity's performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense, income tax expense and certain distributions attributable to certain non-controlling interests.\n\nBelow is a selection of key policies applied in determining the Operating Segment results.\n\n## Internal funding arrangements\n\nGroup Treasury has the responsibility for managing funding for the Consolidated Entity, and Operating Groups obtain their funding from Group Treasury. The interest rates charged by Group Treasury are determined by the currency and term of the funding. Break costs may be charged to Operating Groups for the early repayment of term funding.\n\nGenerally, Operating Groups may only source funding directly from external sources where the funding is secured by the Operating Group's assets. In such cases the Operating Group bears the funding costs directly and Group Treasury may levy additional charges where appropriate.\n\nDeposits are a funding source for the Bank Group. The value of deposits that the Bank Group generates is recognised within Net interest and trading income for segment reporting purposes.\n\n## Transactions between Operating Segments\n\nOperating Segments that enter into arrangements with other Operating Segments must do so on commercial terms or as agreed by the Consolidated Entity's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer.\n\nInternal transactions are recognised in each of the relevant categories of income and expense and eliminated on consolidation as appropriate.",

Changes in fair value are presented in net trading income and gives rise to income statement volatility unless designated in a hedge accounting relationship, in which case the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk to reduce volatility in the income statement. If designated in a cash flow hedge accounting relationship, the effective portion of the derivative's fair value gains or losses is deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve as part of Other comprehensive income (OCI), and subsequently recognised in the income statement at the time at which the hedged item affects the income statement for the hedged risk. For segment reporting purposes, derivatives are accounted for on an accrual basis in the results of the Operating Groups to the extent that the Corporate segment manages the derivative volatility, either through the application of hedge accounting or where the derivative volatility may offset the volatility of other positions managed within the Corporate segment.\n\n## Central Service Groups\n\nThe Central Service Groups provide a range of functions supporting MGL's Operating Groups, ensuring they have the appropriate workplace support and systems to operate effectively and the necessary resources to meet their regulatory, compliance, financial reporting, legal and risk management requirements.\n\nCentral Service Groups recover their costs from Operating Groups generally on either a time and effort allocation basis or a fee for service basis. Central Service Groups include the Corporate Operations Group (COG), Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk Management Group (RMG), Legal and Governance Group (LGG) and Central Executive.\n\n## Performance-related profit share and share-based payments expense\n\nPerformance-related profit share and share-based payments expense relating to the Macquarie Group Employee Retained Equity Plan (MEREP) are recognised in the Corporate segment and are not allocated to Operating Groups.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense and benefits are recognised in the Corporate segment and are not allocated to the Operating Groups. However, to recognise an Operating Group's contribution to permanent income tax differences, the internal management revenue/ charges category is used.\n\nThis internal management revenue/charges category, which is primarily used for permanent income tax differences generated by the Operating Groups, are offset by an equal and opposite amount recognised in the Corporate segment such that they are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Presentation of segment income statements\n\nThe income statements on the following pages for each of the reported segments are in some cases summarised by grouping non-material balances together. Where appropriate, all material or key balances have been reported separately to provide users with information relevant to the understanding of the Consolidated Entity's financial performance. The financial information disclosed relates to the Consolidated Entity's ordinary activities.\n\n## Reportable segment assets\n\nSegment assets are the external operating assets that are employed by a segment in its operating activities.",

The DRP is optional and offers ordinary shareholders in Australia and New Zealand the opportunity to acquire fully paid ordinary shares without transaction costs. A shareholder can elect to participate in or terminate their involvement in the DRP at any time. Equity Shares issued by the Consolidated Entity in the current year and prior year were allocated as fully paid ordinary shares pursuant to the DRP, details of which are included in Note 27 Contributed equity.\n\n## (ii) Dividends not recognised at the end of the financial year\n\nSince the end of the financial year, the Directors have resolved to pay a final dividend of $3.50 per fully paid ordinary share, 40% franked based on tax paid at 30%. The aggregate amount of the proposed dividend expected to be paid on 4 July 2022 from retained profits, but not recognised as a liability at the end of the financial year is $1,341 million. This amount has been estimated based on the number of shares and MEREP awards eligible to participate as at 31 March 2022.\n\n|                                                                                                                   |   CONSOLIDATED |   CONSOLIDATED |   COMPANY |   COMPANY |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                                                                   |        2022    |         2021   |   2022    |    2021   |\n| Cash dividend (distribution of current year profits) ($ per share)                                                |           6.22 |            4.7 |      6.22 |       4.7 |\n| Franking credits available for the subsequent financial year at a corporate  tax rate of 30% (2021: 30%) ($m) (2) |         457    |          426   |    457    |     426   |",

This includes entering into margining and collateralisation arrangements and enforceable master netting arrangements (MNA) with counterparties, particularly in respect of derivatives and maintaining the risk within agreed risk limits as described in Note 36.3 Market risk . The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.

These models incorporate a range of components notably that of Exposure at Default (EAD), Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) ('credit inputs') as well as Forward-Looking Information (FLI).\n\nFor retail portfolios, behavioural variables are also considered in the determination of inputs for ECL modelling.\n\nThe key model inputs used in measuring the ECL include:\n\n- \u00b7 probability of default (PD): The calculation of PDs for retail and wholesale exposures is generally performed at a facility level. Retail exposures are segmented based on product type and shared characteristics that are highly correlated to credit risk such as region, product, counterparty groupings, loan-to-value ratio and other similar criteria. Portfolio PDs are a function of industry type, internal credit ratings and transition matrices used to determine a point in time PD estimate. PD estimates for both retail and wholesale portfolios are also adjusted for FLI\n- \u00b7 exposure at default (EAD): The EAD represents the estimated exposure in the event of a default\n- \u00b7 loss given default (LGD): The LGD associated with the PD used is the magnitude of the ECL in a default event. The LGD is estimated using historical loss rates considering relevant factors for individual exposures or portfolios.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically assesses exposures to determine whether there has been a SICR, which may be evidenced by either qualitative or quantitative factors. Qualitative factors include, but are not limited to material change in internal credit rating, whether an exposure has been identified and placed on CreditWatch, an internal credit monitoring mechanism supervised by the credit watch management committee to closely monitor exposures showing signs of stress. All exposures on CreditWatch are classified as stage II or, if defaulted, as stage III.\n\nSICR thresholds, which require judgement, are used to determine whether an exposure's credit risk has increased significantly. The SICR methodology is based on a relative credit risk approach which considers changes in an underlying exposure's credit risk since origination. This may result in exposures being classified in stage II\n\nthat are of a higher credit quality than other similar exposures that are classified as stage I. Accordingly, while similar increases in the quantum of stage II exposures will suggest a relative deterioration of credit quality, it should not necessarily be inferred that the assets are of a lower credit quality.\n\n## Retail exposures\n\nExposures are assigned a behavioural score which considers the exposures' lifetime PD on initial recognition. This behavioural score is periodically assessed and updated to reflect changes in the underlying exposures' credit behaviour.\n\nSICR movement thresholds between origination and reporting date of behavioural score movements have been established that, where exceeded, result in the exposure being categorised as stage II.\n\n## Wholesale exposures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity assigns an internal credit rating to each exposure at origination based on information available at that date. These internal ratings are broadly aligned to external credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's.\n\nWhere an exposures' assigned credit rating deteriorates beyond pre-defined thresholds per credit rating at origination, the exposure is categorised as stage II. The methodology has been calibrated so that a larger change in rating is required for higher quality credit rated exposures than for lower quality credit rated exposures to be classified as stage II.\n\nFor both retail and wholesale portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 for material retail portfolios, the credit risk for an exposure or portfolio is generally deemed to have increased significantly if the exposure is more than 30 days past due, unless there are product specific characteristics that indicate that this threshold should be rebutted.\n- \u00b7 the AASB 9 'low credit risk' exemption is not applied by the Consolidated Entity to material portfolios\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's definition of default determines the reference point for the calculation of the ECL components, and in particular the PD. Default is generally defined as the point when the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations in full, without recourse by the Consolidated Entity to actions such as realisation of available security; or the borrower is 90 days or more past due on an obligation to the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity periodically monitors its exposures for potential indicators of default such as significant financial difficulty of the borrower including breaches of lending covenants; it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties; or the purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit losses.",

The predicted relationships between these key indicators and the key model components (EAD, PD and LGD) in measuring the ECL have been developed by analysing historical data as part of the development of internal models, calibration and validation process.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies its professional judgement in determining whether there are any inherent risks in the models' predictive outcomes. The overlays primarily reflect management's assessment of the current economic and credit environment relative to the FLI credit cycle model. These overlays account for the risk that underlying credit risk events have occurred, but observable modelled inputs are yet to reflect those events, as well as risks that are specific to regions, counterparties or industries which are difficult to account for within the modelled outcomes. Over time the credit models are recalibrated to enhance the predictive capability. At the reporting date this overlay was approximately $450 million (2021: $450 million). These judgements are reviewed by FMG and RMG at each reporting date.\n\nRMG is responsible for the FLI including the development of scenarios and recommending the range of probability weights to apply to those scenarios. For this purpose, four possible economic scenarios have been developed for this period, being an upside, downside, severe downside and baseline scenario. In calculating the ECL, each of the scenarios is probability weighted and then applied to the exposures' PDs and LGDs.\n\nThe scenarios have been developed using a combination of publicly available data, internal forecasts and third-party information to form the initial baseline. Internal specialists within the Consolidated Entity are consulted to assist in refining and challenging the baseline and the alternate scenarios. For the current reporting period, the Consolidated Entity has generated three alternate scenarios in addition to the baseline scenario, where the alternate scenarios are anchored relative to the baseline scenario.\n\nRefinement of the scenarios includes benchmarking to external data from reputable sources. These sources includes, forecasts published from a range of market economists and official data sources, including major central banks, where available.\n\nWhere there are limited official data sources against which to benchmark key economic indicators on a forward-looking basis, management exercises judgement when determining the duration, severity and impact of the macroeconomic scenarios used by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nAssigning probabilities to these scenarios requires professional judgement. This judgement draws on internal risk and economics specialist input, comparison to general market outlooks and publicly available market commentary.\n\nThe scenarios and the associated probabilities are ultimately approved by senior risk and finance executives.\n\nThe scenarios for each of the key regions where Macquarie's ECL is derived have been set out on the following pages. Noting the diversity of possible scenarios and macroeconomic outcomes, and the continuing uncertainty regarding the implications of events in Ukraine and broader inflationary pressures, these scenarios represent plausible forward-looking views as at the reporting date.\n\nThese scenarios impact the modelled ECL provisioning levels through determination of probabilities of default and level of losses that may be incurred should a default occur. The ability of borrowers to service their obligations through personal or business income is generally estimated using unemployment rates, GDP, commodity prices and interest rates. The losses that the Consolidated Entity may incur in the event of a default, and the collateral utilised is generally estimated through property price and share price index outlooks.\n\nFuture economic conditions may differ to the scenarios outlined, the impact of which will be accounted for in future reporting periods.",

MIC currently owns and operates an energy company that processes and distributes gas and provides related services.\n\nDuring the financial year, MIC realised one of its infrastructure businesses. Proceeds were distributed to shareholders with the Consolidated Entity receiving its proportionate share. Indicators of impairment reversal have been identified which resulted in the Consolidated Entity calculating the investment's recoverable amount. The recoverable amount has been determined using management's estimate of the future risk-adjusted cash flows with significant inputs including net proceeds on realisation of the remaining portfolio businesses. Both the investment's fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and value-in-use (VIU) resulted in a $114 million impairment reversal, which was recognised in the income statement as part of net other impairment charges.",

An assessment of impairment indicators on an aircraft-by-aircraft basis was undertaken by MAF. For each aircraft with impairment indicators, recoverable value, being the higher of its VIU and its fair value less costs of disposal, was determined and compared to its book value. The cash flows included in the VIU assessment considered the circumstances of the lessee and its impact on contracted lease revenue, unleased aircraft, the probability of leases being extended, the time that an aircraft is off-lease, future lease rates and disposal proceeds. The fair value less costs of disposal was determined with reference to independent appraisal values for each aircraft. MAF recognised an impairment for aircraft with impairment indicators where the recoverable value was less than carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable value of the Consolidated Entity's investment in MAF, after accounting for the above-mentioned equity-accounted loss, was also considered. The investment's VIU was determined using the income approach where significant inputs included forecasts over the timing and amount of distributions, and the terminal value of the investment beyond the forecast period. The investment's fair value less costs of disposal was determined with reference to the current market value of the net assets of MAF.\n\nChanges in the carrying value of the investment during the year as a result of the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the United States dollar are accounted for in the Consolidated Entity's foreign currency translation and net investment hedge reserve, together with applicable hedges.",

The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.

Internally, the Consolidated Entity has developed an Economic Capital Adequacy Model (ECAM) that is used to quantify the Consolidated Entity's aggregate level of risk. The economic capital framework complements the management of specific risk types such as equity, credit, market and operational risk by providing an aggregate view of the Consolidated Entity's risk profile. The economic capital model is used to support business decision-making and has three main applications:\n\n- \u00b7 risk appetite setting\n- \u00b7 capital adequacy assessment\n- \u00b7 risk-adjusted performance measurement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is subject to minimum capital requirements externally imposed by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nA wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, MBL, is accredited by APRA to apply the Basel III Foundation Internal Ratings Based Approach for credit risk, the Advanced Measurement Approach for operational risk, the internal model approach for market risk and the internal model approach for interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nRegulatory capital requirements are measured at three levels of consolidation within the Consolidated Entity. MBL and certain subsidiaries which meet the APRA definition of Extended Licensed Entities are reported as Level 1. Level 2 consists of MBL, its subsidiaries and its immediate parent less certain subsidiaries of MBL which are deconsolidated for APRA reporting purposes. These include entities conducting insurance, funds management and non-financial operations. Level 3 consists of the Level 2 group, other bank entities excluded from Level 2 plus the Non-Bank Group. In determining the capital requirements, transactions internal to the Consolidated Entity are eliminated.\n\nAs an APRA authorised and regulated Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC), the Company is required to maintain minimum regulatory capital calculated as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the Non-Bank Group capital requirement, using the Consolidated Entity's ECAM.\n- \u00b7 MBL's minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, based on a percentage of RWA plus Tier 1 deductions using prevailing APRA ADI Prudential Standards\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Level 3 eligible capital consists of ordinary equity, certain reserves and hybrid instruments. The overall Level 3 capital position is reported as an excess over the regulatory imposed minimum capital adequacy requirement.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has satisfied all internally and externally imposed capital requirements at Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 throughout the financial year.",

comprises of agreements between the Consolidated Entity and its lenders that provide that, in the event of liquidation, entitlement of such lenders to repayment of the principal sum and interest thereon is and shall at all times be and remain subordinated to the rights of all other present and future creditors of the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has also issued subordinated

A MEREP participant holding a DSU has no right or interest in any share until the DSU is exercised. The Company may issue shares to the Trustee or direct the Trustee to acquire shares on-market, or via a share acquisition arrangement for potential future allocations to holders of DSUs.\n\nGenerally, where permitted by law, DSUs will provide for cash payments in lieu of dividends paid on MGL ordinary shares before the DSU is exercised. Further, the number of shares underlying a DSU will be adjusted upon any bonus issue or other capital reconstruction of the Company in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules, so that the holder of a DSU does not receive a benefit that holders of the Company's shares do not generally receive. These provisions are intended to provide the holders of DSUs, as far as possible, with the same benefits and risks as holders of RSUs. However, holders of DSUs will have no voting rights with respect to any underlying MGL ordinary shares.\n\nDSUs will only be offered in jurisdictions where legal or tax rules make the grant of RSUs impractical, or where PSUs are structured as DSUs (see PSUs). DSUs have been granted with an expiry period of up to nine years.\n\n|                                                      | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   | NUMBER OF DSU AWARDS   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                      | 2022                   | 2021                   |\n| DSUs on issue at the beginning of the financial year | 3,512,371              | 3,177,680              |\n| Granted during the financial year                    | 1,053,253              | 1,082,878              |\n| Exercised during the financial year                  | (878,592)              | (687,073)              |\n| Forfeited during the financial year                  | (215,197)              | (61,114)               |\n| DSUs on issue at the end of the financial year       | 3,471,835              | 3,512,371              |\n| DSUs exercisable at the end of the financial year    | 1,104,797              | 1,057,957              |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of the DSU awards granted during the financial year was $147.15 (2021: $117.53).",

Only members of the MGL and MBL Executive Committees are eligible to receive PSUs. For the PSUs allocated to Executive Committee Members, two performance hurdles have been determined and each will apply individually to 50% of the total number of PSUs awarded. Hurdles are periodically reviewed by the Board Remuneration Committee (BRC) to ensure they continue to align the interests of staff and shareholders and provide a challenging but meaningful incentive to Executive Committee members. The BRC considers historical and forecast market data, the views of corporate governance bodies, shareholders and regulators as well as market practice. No change has been made to the hurdles for this financial year.\n\nThe hurdles are outlined below.\n\n## Performance hurdle 1\n\n| Hurdle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Reference group                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 50% of the PSUs based solely on the relative average annual return on  ordinary equity (ROE) over the vesting period compared to a reference  group of global financial institutions. A sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable above the 50 th percentile and 100% vesting at the 75 th  percentile. | The current reference group comprises Bank of America Corporation,  Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman  Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Lazard Limited, Morgan  Stanley and UBS AG. |\n\n## Performance hurdle 2\n\n| Hurdle                                                                 | Required result                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 50% of the PSUs based solely on the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) | A sliding scale applies with 50% becoming exercisable at EPS CAGR of                                                         |\n| in earnings per share (EPS) over the vesting period.                   | 7.5% and 100% at EPS CAGR of 12%. For example, if EPS CAGR were  9.75%, 75% of the relevant awards would become exercisable. |\n\nUnder both performance hurdles, the objective is examined once only. Testing occurs annually on 30 June immediately before vesting on 1 July, based on the most recent financial year-end results available. To the extent that a condition is not met when examined, the PSUs due to vest will not be exercisable upon vesting, resulting in no benefit to Executive Committee members.\n\n## Assumptions used to determine fair value of MEREP awards\n\nRSUs and DSUs are measured at their grant dates based on their fair value (1) and for each PSU, the awards expected to vest are measured on the basis of the assumptions below. This amount is recognised as an expense evenly over the respective vesting periods.\n\nRSUs, DSUs and PSUs relating to the MEREP plan for Executive Committee members have been granted in the current financial year in respect of the 2021 performance. The accounting fair value of each of these grants is estimated using the Company's share price on the date of grant and for each PSU also incorporates a discounted cash flow method using the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 expected vesting dates of PSUs: 1 July 2025\n- \u00b7 interest rate to maturity: 0.5291% per annum\n- \u00b7 dividend yield: 3.73% per annum.\n\nWhile RSUs DSUs, and PSUs (for Executive Committee members) for FY2022 will be granted during the FY2023, the Company begins recognising an expense for these awards (based on an initial estimate) from 1 April 2021 related to these future grants. The expense is estimated using the estimated MEREP retention for FY2022 and applying the amortisation profile to the retained amount.\n\nFor PSUs, the estimate also incorporates an interest rate to maturity of 2.91% per annum, expected vesting dates of PSUs of 1 July 2026, and a dividend yield of 3.63% per annum. In the following financial year, the Consolidated Entity will adjust the accumulated expense recognised for the final determination of fair value for each RSU, DSU and PSU when granted and will use this valuation for recognising the expense over the remaining vesting period. The Consolidated Entity annually reviews its estimates of the number of awards (including those delivered through MEREP) that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the employment expenses in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity (for equity settled awards), or a corresponding adjustment to liabilities (for cash settled awards).",

In all other respects, shares allocated rank equally with all other fully paid ordinary shares then on issue.\n\nThe latest offer under the ESP was made during November 2021. A total of 1,888 (2021: 1,902) staff participated in this offer.\n\nOn 2 December 2021, the participants were each allocated 4 (2021: 7) fully paid ordinary shares based on the offer amount of $1,000 and the average market share price of $202.00 (2021: $139.70); resulting in a total of 7,552 (2021: 13,314) shares being allocated. The shares were allocated to staff for no cash consideration. The aggregate value of the shares allocated was deducted from staff profit share and commissions.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2022, compensation expense relating to the ESP totalled $1,526 thousand (2021: $1,860 thousand).\n\n## Historical Share and Option Plans\n\nShares are no longer being issued under the Staff Share Acquisition Plan or the Non-Executive Director Share Acquisition plan. However, employees and Non-Executive Directors still hold shares issued in previous years.\n\nOptions over fully paid unissued ordinary shares are no longer granted under the Macquarie Group Employee Share Option Plan and no options are outstanding.\n\n## Other plans\n\nThe Consolidated Entity operates other local share-based compensation plans, none of which, individually or in aggregate are material.\n\n## Shares issued/purchased on-market for the purpose of an employee incentive scheme\n\nDuring the financial year ended 31 March 2022, the Consolidated Entity issued 4,108,915 shares (2021: issued 5,163,874 shares) for MEREP. A further 7,552 shares were issued for the ESP (2021: 13,314 shares were issued). The average price of all shares issued during the financial year was $151.82 (2021: $112.22 for shares issued) and the average price of the purchases made on-market was $Nil (2021: $Nil)",

SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well-defined objectives. SEs are classified as subsidiaries and are consolidated when control exists.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages with SEs for securitisation, asset backed financing and Structured Financing arrangements in order to diversify its sources of funding for asset origination and capital efficiency purposes. The Consolidated Entity's involvement with SEs is primarily of the following nature:\n\n| Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Securitisations involve transferring assets into a vehicle that sells beneficial interests to investors through the issue  of debt and equity notes with varying levels of subordination.

In certain cases the Consolidated Entity invests alongside its own managed funds to demonstrate further alignment with investors. The carrying value of the Consolidated Entity's investments in funds is disclosed in Note 14 Interests in associates and joint ventures . Interests in the nature of receivables, contract assets and undrawn commitments are disclosed in Note 30 Related party information and Note 11 Held for sale and other assets.\n\nThe Assets under Management (AUM) of $775 billion (2021: $563.5 billion) represent the indicative size of these funds and is measured as the proportional ownership interest in the underlying assets of funds and mandated assets that Macquarie actively manages or advises on.\n\nIn respect of the Consolidated Entity's loan assets' exposure in securitisation, asset backed financing entities and structured financing, the total size of the unconsolidated SEs is $54,951 million (2021: $34,241 million). Size represents either the total assets of the SE (measured either at amortised cost excluding impairments or fair values if readily available); outstanding notional of issued notes or the principal amount of liabilities if there is nominal equity. Size is based on the latest available information with the Consolidated Entity.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's exposure to securitisation entities in the nature of trading assets, margin money, derivatives and financial investments are acquired for the purpose of trading and liquidity management. These exposures are typically managed under market risk limits described in Note 36.3 Market risk . For these reasons, information on the size and structure for these SEs is not considered meaningful for understanding the related risks, and have not been presented in the table above.",

The Consolidated Entity's objective is to reduce the risk of volatility in earnings, within pre-defined thresholds. This volatility is managed through hedge accounting application and use of natural offsetting position of the hedges.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\nDetail on hedging instruments, the nature of hedged risks, as well as the notional and the carrying amount of derivative financial instruments and, in the case of net investment hedges, the notional of foreign currency denominated debt issued, for each type of hedge relationship, is shown in the respective sections. The maturity profile for the hedging instruments' notional amounts are reported based on their contractual maturity. Where a cross currency swap has been dual designated in both a cash flow and a fair value hedge, the notional is shown more than once. Increases in notional profiles of hedging instruments are presented as negative figures, with decreases and maturities presented as positive figures.\n\n## Hedging ineffectiveness\n\nIn the case of a fair value hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument differ to that of the hedged item for the hedged risk. In the case of a cash flow hedge, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. In the case of net investment hedge relationships, hedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the change in the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated debt and foreign exchange contracts attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds, in absolute terms, that of the hedged item. Sources of hedge ineffectiveness primarily arise from basis and timing differences between the hedged items and hedging instruments, and designating existing derivatives with a non-zero fair value as hedging instruments. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported in net trading income in the income statement.\n\n## IBOR reform\n\nDuring the period, the Consolidated Entity completed the transition of all remaining hedging relationships subject to mandatory IBOR reform, and certain non-mandatory transition of hedge accounting relationships to alternate reference rates (ARRs) as described in Note 1 Basis of preparation and Note 36 Financial risk management. The Consolidated Entity has made use of the relief provided by AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 2 relief) to amend the formal designation of these hedging relationships.\n\nAs all hedge relationships subject to mandatory IBOR reform have been transitioned, no uncertainty remains, and the Consolidated Entity is no longer utilising the relief provided under AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Phase 1 relief). Accordingly, the disclosure required under Phase 1 is no longer required.",

Changes in this reserve are reported in the Consolidated Entity's statements of comprehensive income. The cumulative gains and losses remaining in the cash flow hedge reserve for hedging relationships that have ceased, but for which the hedged cash flows are still expected to occur is $1 million gain (2021: $1 million loss). This amount will be transferred to the income statement when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                                     |                  | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   | MATURITY ANALYSIS PER NOTIONAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Instrument type                     | Risk category    | Less than  3 months $m           | 3 to 12 months $m                | 1 to 5  years $m                 | Over 5  years $m                 | Total $m                         |\n|                                     |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  | CONSOLIDATED 2022                | CONSOLIDATED 2022                |\n| Derivative assets                   |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                | Foreign exchange | (14)                             | 308                              | 1,043                            | 574                              | 1,911                            |\n| Interest rate swaps and options     | Interest rate    | 211                              | 1,231                            | 2,055                            | 452                              | 3,949                            |\n| Derivative liabilities              |                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Cross currency swaps                | Foreign exchange | -

The risk of changes in the NIFO for movements in foreign exchange rates is hedged by the Consolidated Entity through the use of a combination of derivatives and foreign denominated borrowings. Refer to Note 36 Financial risk management non-traded risk for further information on the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy.\n\nIn order to reflect the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy, hedge accounting is applied where changes in the derivatives and foreign denominated borrowings are recognised, together with the related foreign currency translation reserve, in the Consolidated Entity's other comprehensive income and is subsequently released to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. Hedge ineffectiveness, if any is recognised in the income statement. Given that the Consolidated Entity's NIFO frequently changes, the hedge designations are reviewed on a monthly basis or more frequently where required.\n\n|                                          |                  | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   | CONSOLIDATED CARRYING AMOUNT   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                          |                  | ASSET                          | ASSET                          | LIABILITY                      | LIABILITY                      |\n| Hedging instrument                       | Risk category    | 2022 $m                        | 2021 $m                        | 2022 $m                        | 2021 $m                        |\n| Foreign exchange contracts               | Foreign exchange | 153                            | 51                             | 55                             | 223                            |\n| Foreign currency denominated issued debt | Foreign exchange | -                              | -                              | 18,371                         | 16,322                         |\n\n|                                          |                  | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   | CONSOLIDATED NOTIONAL   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                          |                  | ASSET                   | ASSET                   | LIABILITY               | LIABILITY               |\n|                                          | Risk category    | 2022 $m                 | 2021 $m                 | 2022 $m                 | 2021 $m                 |\n| Hedging instrument                       |                  |                         |                         |                         |                         |\n| Foreign exchange contracts (1)           | Foreign exchange | 4,148                   | 2,211                   | 1,913                   | 4,877                   |\n| Foreign currency denominated issued debt | Foreign exchange | -                       | -                       | 18,512                  | 16,244                  |\n\nIn order to hedge the currency exposure of certain net investments in foreign operations, the Consolidated Entity jointly designates both foreign exchange derivative contracts (from the currency of the underlying foreign operation to USD) and foreign denominated debt issued (from USD to AUD). As a result, the notional value of hedging instruments presented in the table above of $24,573 million (2021: $23,332 million) represents the notional of both the derivative hedging instrument and the foreign denominated debt issued and hence exceeds the $18,543 million (2021: $16,683 million) notional of the underlying hedged component of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness is the extent to which the absolute change in either the fair value of the derivative or the carrying amount of foreign currency denominated debt issued attributable to the change in exchange rates exceeds that of the hedged item. There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement by the Consolidated Entity in the current year (2021: $Nil).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 March 2022 continued\n\n## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management\n\n## Risk Management Group (RMG)\n\nRisk is an integral part of the Consolidated Entity's businesses. The material risks faced by the Consolidated Entity include aggregate, asset, conduct, credit, environmental and social (including climate change), equity, financial crime, legal, liquidity, market, operational (including cyber and information security), regulatory and compliance, reputational, strategic, tax, and work health and safety risks.\n\nThe primary responsibility for risk management lies with the business. An important part of the role of all staff throughout Macquarie is to ensure they manage risks appropriately.\n\nRMG is independent of other areas of the Consolidated Entity. RMG approval is required for all material risk acceptance decisions. RMG reviews and assesses risks and sets limits. Where appropriate, these limits are approved by the Executive Committee and the Board. The Head of RMG, as Macquarie's CRO, is a member of the Executive Committee of MGL and MBL and reports directly to the CEO with a secondary reporting line to the Board Risk Committee. Further details on the Risk Management Framework in the Consolidated Entity can be found in the Risk Management Report of this Annual Report.\n\n## Note 36.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to complete its contractual obligations when they fall due. The consequential loss is the amount of the financial obligation not paid back, or the loss incurred in replicating a trading contract with a new counterparty.\n\n## Credit risk assessment and approval\n\nExercise of credit authority within Macquarie is undertaken under authority delegated by the MGL and MBL Boards directly. Credit risk assessment includes a comprehensive review of the creditworthiness of the counterparty and related entities, key risk and mitigants, and that the downside risk is properly understood and acceptable.\n\nAfter this analysis is undertaken, limits are set for an acceptable level of potential exposure. All wholesale limits and ratings are reviewed at least once a year or more frequently if required.\n\nRetail credit exposures are monitored by the business units and overseen by RMG Credit on a portfolio basis.\n\nAll credit exposures are monitored regularly against limits. For limit monitoring, credit exposures for loan assets are reported at amortised cost. Derivative exposures are measured using high confidence potential future underlying asset prices.\n\nTo mitigate credit risk, where appropriate, the Consolidated Entity makes use of margining and other forms of collateral or credit enhancement techniques (including guarantees, letters of credit and the purchase of credit default swaps).\n\n## Ratings and reviews\n\nRefer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for details regarding the manner in which the Consolidated Entity has adopted and applied AASB 9's expected credit loss impairment requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the credit risk associated with assets on the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9, the following methodology has been adopted:\n\n## Wholesale rating\n\nMacquarie wholesale ratings broadly correspond to Standard & Poor's credit ratings as follows:\n\n| Credit Profile       | Internal Rating   | Standard & Poor's  Equivalent   |\n|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Investment grade     | MQ1 to MQ8        | AAA to BBB-                     |\n| Non-investment grade | MQ9 to MQ16       | BB+ to C                        |\n| Default              | MQ99              | Default                         |\n\n## Retail rating\n\nRetail pools are mapped to the credit quality grades based on their PDs.\n\nMapping retail portfolios to the credit grades has been done for comparability of the overall portfolio presentation and does not reflect the way that the retail portfolio is segmented for management purposes. Management reviews a range of information, including past due status for the portfolio, to assess the credit quality of these assets.\n\n## Due from subsidiaries\n\nBalances with subsidiaries are mapped to the rating grades assigned internally to these counterparties for the pricing of internal funding arrangements on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Portfolio and country risk\n\nA review of the credit portfolio analysing credit concentrations by counterparty, geography, risk type, industry and credit quality is carried out quarterly and reported to the Board semi-annually. Policies are in place to regulate large exposures to single counterparties or groups of counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has a country risk management framework which covers the assessment of country risk and the approval of country risk limits. Where appropriate the country risk is mitigated by political risk insurance.",

These arrangements includes:\n\n- \u00b7 securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash, for which the fair value of the securities and commodities borrowed is equal to or less than the cash deposited with the counterparty\n- \u00b7 securities received as collateral in return for the transfer of other securities; and\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase agreements (collateralised financing arrangements), for which the fair value of the securities and commodities received as collateral is generally in excess of the principal amount\n- \u00b7 securities borrowed on an unsecured basis in return for a fee.",

The Consolidated Entity is permitted to sell or repledge the securities and commodities received. In the absence of default by the counterparty, the Consolidated Entity has an obligation to return the non-cash collateral received to the counterparty.\n\nFor securities and commodities borrowed in return for cash and reverse repurchase arrangements, the fair value of non-cash collateral received is $51,818 million (2021: $37,149 million) of which the fair value of non cash collateral re-pledged is $7,673 million (2021: $8,796 million).\n\nFor securities borrowed in return for other securities, the fair value of the securities received is $8,936 million (2021: $10,260 million).\n\nFor securities borrowed on an unsecured basis, the fair value of the securities received is $6,199 million (2021: $3,904 million) of which the fair value of securities repledged is $6,051 million (2021: $3,444 million).\n\nThe fair value attributed to non-cash collateral held is judgemental and measured with reference to quoted prices in active markets where available (for example listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair value are estimated using pricing models or other recognised valuation techniques that maximise the use of quoted prices and observable market inputs.\n\n## Loan assets\n\n## Home loans\n\nMacquarie purchases risk protection for its Home Loans portfolio. Prior to 2017 this was in the form of Lenders Mortgage Insurance from a well rated Australian LMI provider. Since then Macquarie has diversified its risk protection coverage to a global panel of reinsurers with diverse lines of business coverage and ratings ranging from AA to A- from external rating agencies. The length of risk protection cover is up to 10 years from the year of origination with the type of cover including excess of loss and quota share.\n\nThe following table provides information on the loan to collateral value ratio as determined using loan carrying values and the most recent valuation of the home loan collateral.\n\n|                       | 2022         | 2022    | 2022     | 2021         | 2021    | 2021         |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------|----------|--------------|---------|--------------|\n|                       | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m | Australia $m | EMEA $m | Total $m     |\n|                       |              |         |          |              |         | CONSOLIDATED |\n| <=25%                 | 2,982        | 5       | 2,987    | 2,182        | 5       | 2,187        |\n| >25% to 50%           | 19,074       | 36      | 19,110   | 13,360       | 56      | 13,416       |\n| >50% to 70%           | 39,930       | 153     | 40,083   | 29,576       | 176     | 29,752       |\n| >70% to 80%           | 29,248       | 72      | 29,320   | 22,199       | 65      | 22,264       |\n| >80% to 90%           | 3,176        | 10      | 3,186    | 3,656        | 14      | 3,670        |\n| >90% to 100%          | 549          | 1       | 550      | 676          | 5       | 681          |\n| Partly collateralised | 34           | 2       | 36       | 30           | 1       | 31           |\n| Total home loans      | 94,993       | 279     | 95,272   | 71,679       | 322     | 72,001       |",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management continued\n\n## Note 36.1 Credit risk continued\n\n## Asset financing\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases assets and provides asset-related financing, to corporate and retail clients. Titles to the underlying assets are held by the Consolidated Entity as collateral. Of the asset finance portfolio of $10,046 million (2021: $13,354 million), the credit exposure after considering the depreciated value of collateral is $4,355 million (2021: $5,921 million).\n\n## Corporate, commercial and other lending\n\nCollateral held against corporate, commercial and other lending consists of secured positions over assets of the counterparty, often in the form of corporate assets. Of the term lending of $29,426 million (2021: $19,670 million), the credit exposure after considering the estimated value of collateral and credit enhancements is $4,860 million (2021: $5,382 million).\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are referred to as Over the Counter (OTC) derivatives. The Consolidated Entity's and Company's OTC derivatives are cleared and settled either through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), or bilateral contracts between two counterparties.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's approach to financial risk management includes entering into margining and collateralisation arrangements and enforceable master netting arrangements (MNA) with counterparties. The MNAs allow for net settlement with counterparties in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement.\n\nRefer Note 39 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities for impact of master netting arrangements and margins and other financial collateral held against the positions as at balance date.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nDebt securities held by the Consolidated Entity carrying a credit risk are primarily in the nature of bonds, NCDs, floating rate notes (FRN), commercial paper and other debt securities for liquidity management purposes and other securities for short-term gains.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity utilises Credit Default Swaps, guarantees, other forms of credit enhancements or collateral in order to minimise the exposure to this credit risk.\n\n## Settlement assets\n\nSecurity and commodity settlements of $6,287 million (2021: $7,253 million) and $4,802 million (2021: $2,292 million) respectively presented under margin money and settlement assets, represent amounts owed by an exchange (or a client) for equities, commodities and other securities sold. These assets are collateralised with the underlying securities, commodities or cash held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement. The period between trade and settlement date varies as per regional regulatory and business norms.\n\n## Other financial assets\n\nCommodity related receivables under other financial assets are normally collateralised with underlying commodity held by the Consolidated Entity until the date of settlement.\n\n## Credit commitments\n\nUndrawn facilities and lending securities commitments of $6,823 million (2021: $7,210 million) are secured through collateral and credit enhancement out of the total undrawn facilities and lending securities commitments of $15,647 million (2021: $13,695 million).\n\n## Additional collateral\n\nApart from collateral details disclosed above, the Consolidated Entity also holds other types of collateral, such as unsupported guarantees. While such mitigants have value as a credit risk mitigant often providing rights in insolvency, their assignable values are uncertain and therefore are assigned no value for disclosure purposes.\n\nFor all collaterals, in the event of default realised collateral values may be lower than the value of collateral as at the reporting date.\n\n## Repossessed collateral\n\nIn the event of a customer default, the Consolidated Entity may either take possession of the underlying collateral held as security and/or exercise its right to dispose of the customer's asset. At the reporting date the Consolidated Entity did not have any material amounts of such collateral recognised in its Statements of financial position.",

Macquarie's liquidity policy is approved by the MGL and MBL Boards after endorsement by the ALCO and liquidity reporting is provided to the Boards on a regular basis. The ALCO includes the MGL CEO, MBL CEO, CFO, CRO, Co-Heads of Group Treasury and Operating Group Heads.\n\nRMG provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management, including ownership of liquidity policies and key limits and approval of material liquidity scenario assumptions.\n\n## Liquidity policy and risk appetite\n\nThe MGL and MBL liquidity policies are designed so that each of Macquarie, the Bank Group and the Non-Bank Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due. The MBL Liquidity Policy outlines the standalone framework for the Bank Group and its principles are consistent with the MGL Liquidity Policy. Macquarie's liquidity risk appetite is intended to ensure that Macquarie is able to meet all of its liquidity obligations during a period of liquidity stress: a twelve month period with constrained access to funding markets for MBL, no access to funding markets for MGL and with only a limited reduction in Macquarie's franchise businesses.\n\nReflecting the longer-term nature of the Non-Bank Group asset profile, MGL is funded predominantly with a mixture of capital and long-term wholesale funding. MBL is an authorised deposit-taking institution and is funded mainly with capital, long-term liabilities and deposits.\n\n## Liquidity contingency plan\n\nGroup Treasury maintains a Liquidity Contingency Plan, which outlines how a liquidity crisis would be managed. The plan defines roles and responsibilities and actions to be taken in a liquidity event, including identifying key information requirements and appropriate communication plans with both internal and external parties.\n\nSpecifically, the plan details:\n\n- \u00b7 the officers responsible for enacting the plan\n- \u00b7 factors that may constitute a crisis\n- \u00b7 a committee of senior executives responsible for managing a crisis\n- \u00b7 a communications strategy\n- \u00b7 the information required to effectively manage a crisis\n- \u00b7 a high level checklist of possible actions to conserve or raise additional liquidity\n- \u00b7 contact lists to facilitate prompt communication with all key internal and external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition, Macquarie monitors a range of early warning indicators on a daily basis that might assist in identifying emerging risks in Macquarie's liquidity position. These indicators are reviewed by Senior Management and are used to inform any decisions regarding invoking the plan.\n\nThe Liquidity Contingency Plan is subject to regular review by both Group Treasury and RMG. It is submitted annually to the ALCO and the MGL and MBL Boards for approval.\n\nMacquarie is a global financial institution, with branches and subsidiaries in a variety of countries. Regulations in certain countries may require some branches or subsidiaries to have specific local contingency plans. Where that is the case, the Liquidity Contingency Plan contains either a supplement or a reference to a separate document providing the specific information required for those branches or subsidiaries.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nMacquarie prepares a Funding Strategy for both MGL and MBL on an annual basis and monitors progress against the strategy throughout the year.\n\nThe Funding Strategy aims to maintain Macquarie's diversity of funding sources for MGL and MBL, ensure ongoing compliance with all liquidity requirements and facilitate forecast asset growth.\n\nThe Funding Strategy is reviewed by the ALCO and approved by the respective Boards.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nScenario analysis is central to Macquarie's liquidity risk management framework. In addition to regulatory defined scenarios, Group Treasury models additional liquidity scenarios covering both market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crises.\n\nThese scenarios use a range of assumptions, which Macquarie intends to be conservative, regarding the level of access to capital markets, deposit outflows, contingent funding requirements and asset sales.\n\nAs an example, one internal scenario projects the expected cash and liquid asset position during a combined market-wide and Macquarie name-specific crisis over a twelve month time frame. This scenario assumes no access to wholesale funding markets, a significant loss of customer deposits and contingent funding outflows resulting from undrawn commitments, market moves impacting derivatives and other margined positions combined with a multiple notch credit rating downgrade. Macquarie's cash and liquid asset portfolio must exceed the minimum requirement as calculated in this scenario at all times.",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\nFinancial risk management continued\n\nNote 36.2 Liquidity risk\n\n## continued\n\n## Liquid asset holdings\n\nGroup Treasury centrally maintains a portfolio of highly liquid unencumbered assets which are intended to ensure adequate liquidity is available under a range of market conditions. The minimum level of cash and liquid assets is calculated with reference to internal scenario analysis and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe cash and liquid asset portfolio contains only unencumbered assets that can be relied on to maintain their liquidity in a crisis scenario. Specifically, cash and liquid assets held to meet minimum internal and regulatory requirements must be cash balances (including central bank reserves and overnight lending to financial institutions), qualifying High Quality Liquid Assets, other external Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) repo eligible securities or Australian assets internally securitised by Macquarie and held as contingent collateral in the RBA's facilities such as the Committed Liquidity Facility - so called 'Alternative Liquid Assets' (ALA). Composition constraints are also applied to ensure appropriate diversity and quality of the assets in the portfolio. The cash and liquid asset portfolio is held in a range of currencies consistent with the distribution of liquidity needs by currency, allowing for an acceptable level of currency mismatches.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nAn internal funds transfer pricing framework is in place that has been designed to produce appropriate incentives for business decision-making by reflecting the funding costs arising from business actions and the separate funding tasks and liquidity requirements of the Bank and Non-Bank Groups. Under this framework, each business is allocated the full cost of the funding required to support its products and business lines, recognising the actual and contingent funding-related exposures their activities create. Businesses that raise funding are compensated at a level that is appropriate for the liquidity benefit provided by the funding.\n\n## Contractual undiscounted cash flows\n\nThe following tables summarise the maturity profile of the Consolidated Entity's financial liabilities as at 31 March based on a contractual undiscounted repayment basis and hence would vary from the carrying value as reported in the Statements of financial position at the balance date. Repayments subject to notice are treated as if notice were given immediately. This does not reflect the behaviour of the expected cash flows as indicated by the Consolidated Entity's deposit retention history since the Consolidated Entity expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Consolidated Entity could be required to pay.",

Liquidity risk on these items is not managed on the basis of contractual maturity, as they are frequently settled in the short-term at fair value.\n- (3)  Where multiple derivatives are combined in order to form a single hedge instrument designated in a hedge accounting relationship, each derivative is considered independently for the purposes of assessing liquidity risk and for the disclosures requirements.\n\n- (5)  Includes $9,994 million payables to SE note holders disclosed on a contractual maturity basis. The expected maturity of the notes is dependent on the repayment of the underlying loans included in the loan assets.\n- (6) Includes securities with conditional repayment obligations. The cash outflow on the principal component on these securities is disclosed using the earliest optional exchange dates and the cash outflow of the interest component is disclosed using coupon dates instead of the contractual maturity. For contractual maturity of these securities refer to Note 26 Loan capital, further these instruments may be converted into ordinary shares on the occurrence of an other exchange event, and this may impact their maturity profile.\n- (7) Cash flows on contingent liabilities and commitments are dependent on the occurrence of various future events and conditions and may or may not result in an outflow of resources. These are reported in the '0 to 3 months' unless they are payable on demand or the contractual terms specify a longer dated cash flow.\n\nStatements",

The Consolidated Entity is exposed to the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 volatility: The risk of loss due to changes in the volatility of a risk factor\n- \u00b7 price: The risk of loss due to changes in price of a risk factor (interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities etc.)\n- \u00b7 basis: Risk of imperfect correlation between offsetting investments in a hedging strategy\n- \u00b7 illiquid market: Risk of inability to sell assets or close out positions in thinly-traded markets at close to the last market prices\n- \u00b7 correlation: Risk that the actual correlation between two assets or variables is different from the assumed correlation\n- \u00b7 concentration: Risk of over concentration of trading exposures in certain markets and products\n- \u00b7 valuation adjustments: Risk of actual valuation adjustments to derivative positions; specifically Credit Valuation Adjustment, Debit Valuation Adjustment and Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA).\n\nIt is recognised that all trading activities contain calculated elements of risk taking. The Consolidated Entity is prepared to accept such risks provided they are within agreed limits, independently and correctly identified, calculated and monitored by RMG, and reported to Senior Management on a regular basis. RMG monitors positions within the Consolidated Entity according to a limit structure which sets limits for all exposures in all markets.\n\nLimits are for both individual trading desks and divisions as well as in aggregate.\n\nRMG sets three complementary limit structures:\n\n- \u00b7 position limits: Volume, maturity and open position limits are set on a large number of market instruments and securities in order to constrain concentration risk and to avoid the accumulation of risky, illiquid positions\n- \u00b7 contingent loss limits: Worst case scenarios that shock prices and volatilities by more than that which has occurred historically. Multiple scenarios are set for each market to capture the non-linearity and complexity of exposures arising from derivatives. A wide range of assumptions about the correlations between markets is applied\n- \u00b7 Value-at-Risk (VaR) limits: A statistical measure based on a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level, as stipulated by the APRA capital adequacy standard. The model is validated daily by back testing a one-day VaR against hypothetical and actual daily trading profit or loss.",

The following factors can limit the effectiveness of  VaR in predicting future price moves:\n\n- \u00b7 VaR focuses on unexceptional price moves so that it does not account for losses that could occur beyond the 99% level of confidence.\n- \u00b7 the use of historical data means that the current model parameters may not reflect future market conditions especially when entering a period of heightened volatility. The model utilises exponential weighting to place emphasis on the most recent market movements to more accurately reflect current conditions\n\nFor capital adequacy purposes, debt-specific risk is measured using APRA's standard method, whilst all other exposures are captured by the VaR model. This combined approach has been approved by APRA and is subject to periodic review.\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has exposure to non-traded market risks arising from transactions entered into during its normal course of business and as a result of its investments in foreign operations. These risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange: Changes in the spot exchange rates.\n- \u00b7 interest rate: Changes in the level, shape and volatility of yield curves, and/or client behaviour given these changes\n\nThe Consolidated Entity has limited appetite for non-traded market risks. Where commercially feasible, these risks are transferred into the trading books of CGM and Group Treasury and governed within the traded market risk framework described above. Responsibility for managing exposures rests with individual businesses, with additional central monitoring from FMG for foreign exchange risks. Any residual non-traded market risks are subject to independent limits approved by RMG and reported regularly to Senior Management.\n\nWhere foreign exchange exposures arise as a result of investments in foreign operations, a key objective of the Consolidated Entity's Non-traded market risk policy is to reduce the sensitivity of regulatory capital ratios to foreign currency movements. This is achieved by leaving specific investments in core foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements and captured in the foreign currency translation reserve, a component of regulatory capital. This aligns the currency of capital supply with capital requirements.\n\nAs a result of this policy, the Consolidated Entity is therefore partially exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of its net investment in foreign operations to Australian dollars. Apart from this there is no material non-trading foreign exchange risk.\n\n## Accounting considerations arising from hedging activities\n\nThe use of derivative and other financial instruments to hedge non-traded positions potentially gives rise to income statement volatility due to difference in accounting treatments. The Consolidated Entity manages this through hedge accounting as set out in Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities and Note 35 Hedge accounting.",

        "page_content": "## Note 36\n\n## Financial risk management continued\n\n## Note 36.3 Market risk continued\n\n## Interest rate risk- Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR)\n\nDuring 2018, the Consolidated Entity initiated a group-wide project, sponsored by its Chief Financial Officer (CFO), to manage the impacts of IBOR reform, including overseeing the transition from LIBOR to ARRs. A group-wide steering committee was established with its key responsibility being the governance of the project and comprised of senior executives from the Consolidated Entity's Operating Groups, Financial Management Group (FMG), Risk Management Group (RMG), Corporate Operations Group (COG) and Legal and Governance.\n\nIn addition to the project's progress outlined in Consolidated Entity's annual and interim financial statements for previous periods, the project achieved several important milestones for the period ended 31 March 2022 including that the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 is transacting across a broad range of ARR currencies and products, supported by changes to key systems and processes.\n- \u00b7 has successfully transitioned all contracts referencing LIBORs that ceased publication on 31 December 2021. Some so called 'tough legacy' contracts (retail mortgages) continue to reference synthetic GBP LIBOR. The use of synthetic LIBOR is expected to be temporary and transition efforts to cease using synthetic GBP LIBOR will continue in 2022\n- \u00b7 ceased using USD LIBOR in new contracts after 31 December 2021 aside from exceptional use cases\n- \u00b7 has transitioned all hedge accounting relationships impacted by IBOR cessation except for a small number of USD LIBOR positions which will mature prior to cessation.\n- \u00b7 transitioned its internal USD LIBOR, EURIBOR and CDOR funding to Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR), Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR) and Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (CORRA) respectively, and re-hedged external funding exposures to the relevant currency ARR, given sufficient liquidity in the relevant markets\n\nGiven progress in recent years, including the recent achievements outlined above, there has been a significant reduction in the remaining LIBOR transition effort and risks. The key remaining task is to work with clients and counterparties to transition legacy USD LIBOR contracts, or ensure these contracts contain robust fallbacks, to ARRs before USD LIBOR publication ceases on 30 June 2023. Whilst the transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts exposes the Consolidated Entity to risks, including those outlined below, from 1 April 2022, the Consolidated Entity's IBOR transition governance model was decentralised, under which central oversight reduced and parameters were established for the operating groups to deliver appropriate outcomes for the remainder of the LIBOR transition effort and risks.\n\nMacquarie has identified the following four inherent risks arising from transition of legacy USD LIBOR contracts:\n\n- \u00b7 financial risk: This includes (i) value transfers during transition to ARRs, or triggering of fallback terms and default interest payment terms, (ii) basis risk from products and currencies moving at different times, (iii) change in accounting treatment impacts including hedge accounting, capital, tax and reported earnings, and (iv) loss in revenue/market share from not being ready to participate in ARR markets\n- \u00b7 legal risk: This includes (i) client disputes over amendment terms, (ii) litigation from clients and counterparties (including potential class actions) due to inappropriate/unenforceable contractual terms or losses from transition\n- \u00b7 conduct risk: This includes (i) real or perceived benefit of information asymmetry between financial institutions and clients during transition, (ii) real or perceived unfair treatment of clients during transition, and (iii) market participants attempt to influence ARRs during transition or misconduct in markets where there is insufficient liquidity\n- \u00b7 operational risk: This includes (i) infrastructure and processes that result in errors upon transition, and (ii) reduced model accuracy due to lack of historical data.\n\nWhilst IBOR reforms, including the transition from LIBOR to ARRs, are important changes for the Consolidated Entity, they have not resulted in changes to the Consolidated Entity's risk management strategy and these risks are managed within the existing risk management framework.\n\nExposure yet to be transitioned to ARRs: Notional value information relating to the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments which are yet to transition to ARRs as at the reporting date includes:\n\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial assets: Non-Derivative financial assets exposure of $8,762 million in USD LIBOR and $432 million in other currencies. The exposure at 31 March 2021 was in USD LIBOR ($5,234 million), GBP LIBOR ($904 million) and other currencies ($48 million)\n- \u00b7 derivatives: Derivatives exposure of $71,853 million in USD LIBOR and $79 million in other currencies. The exposure at 31 March 2021 was in USD LIBOR ($51,057 million), GBP LIBOR ($25,857 million), JPY LIBOR ($728 million) and other currencies ($129 million)\n- \u00b7 non-derivative financial liabilities: Non-Derivative financial liabilities exposure of $11,277 million in USD LIBOR. The exposure at 31 March 2021 was in USD LIBOR, ($13,839 million) and GBP LIBOR ($1,882 million).",

Only exposures with contractual maturities extending beyond the replacement date have been included\n- \u00b7 for contracts that reference more than one benchmark, such as a cross currency swap, the exposure includes both benchmarks to reflect the absolute exposure to different reference rates\n- \u00b7 derivative contracts of $13,419 million designated in hedge accounting relationships have synthetically transitioned from USD LIBOR to SOFR and have been excluded.\n- \u00b7 exposures to benchmarks which are not subject to mandatory replacement such as BBSW (Australia), EURIBOR (Euro) and certain tenors of CDOR (Canada), will be considered in scope when the Consolidated Entity makes a determination that the client and counterparty exposures in such benchmarks are required to be transitioned to ARR as a consequence of IBOR reform. This determination is primarily impacted by market demand and the level of liquidity in respective benchmarks and products.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is active in various currencies globally. The net investment in foreign operations generates capital requirements in foreign currencies and results in sensitivity of the capital ratio to movements in the Australian dollar rate against various foreign currencies. The Consolidated Entity hedges this exposure by leaving specific investments in foreign operations exposed to foreign currency translation movements, which aligns the currency of capital supply with capital requirements. Refer to Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities and Note 35 Hedge accounting for details regarding the application of hedge accounting to the Consolidated Entity's net investment in foreign operations.\n\nThe sensitivity of the Consolidated Entity net investment in foreign operations to the most material currencies after considering related hedges is presented in the table below.\n\n|                      | 2022                          | 2022                                                     | 2021                          | 2021                                                     |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                      | Movement in  exchange rates % | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive  income after tax $m | Movement in  exchange rates % | Sensitivity of other  comprehensive  income after tax $m |\n| United States dollar | +10                           | (877)                                                    | +10                           | (633)                                                    |\n| Pound sterling       | +10                           | (125)                                                    | +10                           | (91)                                                     |\n| Euro                 | +10                           | (67)                                                     | +10                           | (49)                                                     |\n| Canadian dollar      | +10                           | (15)                                                     | +10                           | (18)                                                     |\n| Total                |                               | (1,084)                                                  |                               | (791)                                                    |\n| United States dollar | -10                           | 1,071                                                    | -10                           | 773                                                      |\n| Pound sterling       | -10                           | 154                                                      | -10                           | 112                                                      |\n| Euro                 | -10                           | 81                                                       | -10                           | 60                                                       |\n| Canadian dollar      | -10                           | 18                                                       | -10                           | 22                                                       |\n| Total                |                               | 1,324                                                    |                               | 967                                                      |",

If the market for a financial instrument is not active, fair values are estimated using present value or other valuation techniques, using inputs based on market conditions prevailing at the measurement date.\n\nThe values derived from applying these techniques are affected by the choice of valuation model used and the underlying assumptions made regarding inputs such as timing and amounts of future cash flows, discount rates, credit risk, volatility and correlation.\n\nItems measured at fair value are categorised in their entirety, in accordance with the levels of the fair value hierarchy as outlined below:\n\n| Level 1   | unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities                                                                                                      |\n|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Level 2   | inputs other than quoted prices included within  Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived  from prices) |\n| Level 3   | inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs).                                                                               |\n\nThe appropriate fair value hierarchy level for an item is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires the use of the price within the bid-offer spread that is most representative of fair value.\n\nValuation systems will typically generate mid-market prices. The bid-offer adjustment reflects the extent to which bid-offer costs would be incurred if substantially all of the residual net exposure to market risks were closed, on a portfolio basis, using available hedging instruments.\n\nThe fair values calculated for financial instruments which are carried in the Statements of financial position at amortised cost (as disclosed in Note 37 Measurement categories of financial instruments) are for disclosure purposes only. The following methods and assumptions applied to derive these fair values can require significant judgement by management and therefore may not necessarily be comparable to other financial institutions nor may it be the price at which the asset is sold for a liability repurchased in a market-based transaction:\n\n- \u00b7 the fair values of liquid assets and other instruments maturing within three months are approximate to their carrying amounts. This assumption is applied to liquid assets and the short-term portion of all other financial assets and financial liabilities\n\n- \u00b7 the fair value of demand deposits with no fixed maturity approximates their carrying amount as they are short-term in nature or are payable on demand\n- \u00b7 the fair values of all loan assets, term deposits and debt liabilities carried at amortised cost, is determined with reference to changes in interest rates and credit spreads\n- \u00b7 the fair values of variable rate financial instruments, including cash collateral on lending and borrowing and repurchase agreements approximates their carrying amounts\n- \u00b7 the fair value of fixed rate loans and debt investments carried at amortised cost is estimated by reference to current market rates offered on similar loans and the creditworthiness of the borrower\n- \u00b7 substantially all of the Consolidated Entity's commitments to extend credit are at variable rates. As such, there is no significant exposure to fair value fluctuations resulting from interest rate movements relating to these commitments.\n- \u00b7 the fair value of issued debt securities and loan capital, where carried at amortised cost, is based on quoted prices in active markets where available. Where quoted prices are not available the fair value is based on discounted cash flows using rates appropriate to the term and incorporates changes in the Consolidated Entity's own credit spread\n\nThe following methods and significant assumptions have been applied in determining the fair values of following items:\n\n- \u00b7 repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, being collateralised financing arrangements, are measured at fair value with reference to the securities which are held or provided as the collateral for the financing agreement\n- \u00b7 trading assets including commodities and commodity contracts, trading liabilities, derivative financial instruments and other transactions undertaken for trading purposes are measured at fair value by reference to quoted prices in active markets where available (for example listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not available, then fair values are estimated on the basis of other recognised valuation techniques\n- \u00b7 financial investments classified as FVTPL or FVOCI are measured at fair value by reference to quoted prices in active markets where available (for example listed securities). If quoted prices in active markets are not available, the fair values are estimated on the basis of other recognised valuation techniques that maximise the use of quoted prices and observable market inputs\n- \u00b7 investment property are measured at fair value based on the discounted future cash flows unless market valuation is available based on recent transactions or current market prices\n- \u00b7 fair values of variable rate loans classified as FVOCI is equal to its carrying value on the basis that the interest rates are reflective of market rates offered on similar loans",

Where exposures are managed on a portfolio basis then the adjustment is calculated on a counterparty basis for those exposures\n- \u00b7 the Consolidated Entity has incorporated the market implied funding costs for uncollateralised derivative positions as a Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA). FVA is determined by calculating the net expected exposures at a counterparty level and applying the Consolidated Entity's internal Treasury lending rates as an input into the calculation. The approach takes into account the PD of each counterparty, as well as any mandatory break clauses.\n\nWhere valuation techniques are used to determine fair values, they are validated and periodically reviewed by qualified personnel independent of the area that created them. All models are reviewed before they are used. Models are calibrated periodically to test the outputs and reflect the prices from observable current market transactions in same instrument or other available observable market data.\n\nTo the extent possible, models use only observable market data (for example OTC derivatives), however management is required to make assumptions for certain inputs that are not supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument such as volatility and correlation",

Transfers out of Level 3 were principally due to valuation inputs becoming observable during the financial year. Financial assets reclassified into/out of the fair value hierarchy disclosure due to recognition and measurement category changes, or where there have been changes in significant influence or control but some form of interests in the assets are still retained, are also presented as transfers into/out of Level 3.\n\n## Unrecognised gains or losses\n\nThe best evidence of fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only data from observable markets. Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the asset or liability is recognised ('day 1 profit or loss'). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in the income statement over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nThe table below summarises the deferral and recognition of profit or loss where a valuation technique has been applied for which significant unobservable inputs are used:\n\n|                                                          | CONSOLIDATED   | CONSOLIDATED   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                          | 2022 $m        | 2021 $m        |\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year           | 87             | 179            |\n| Deferred gains on new transactions and other adjustments | 51             | 6              |\n| Foreign exchange movements                               | 1              | (23)           |\n| Recognised in net trading income during the year         | (63)           | (75)           |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year                 | 76             | 87             |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of valuations using unobservable inputs\n\nThe table below shows the sensitivity to reasonably possible alternative assumptions, for Level 3 assets and liabilities whose fair values are determined in whole or in part using unobservable inputs. The impact of the sensitivity of instruments which hedge the Level 3 positions but are classified as Level 1 or 2 is not included in the table below:\n\n|                                   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | FAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   | UNFAVOURABLE CHANGES   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | Profit or loss $m    | OCI $m               | Profit or loss $m      | OCI $m                 |\n|                                   |                      |                      | CONSOLIDATED 2022      | CONSOLIDATED 2022      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 134                  | -                    | (137)                  | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 101                  | -                    | (96)                   | -                      |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 94                   | -                    | (83)                   | -                      |\n| Total                             | 329                  | -                    | (316)                  | -                      |\n|                                   |                      |                      | CONSOLIDATED 2021      | CONSOLIDATED 2021      |\n| Product type                      |                      |                      |                        |                        |\n| Commodities                       | 113                  | -                    | (73)                   | -                      |\n| Interest rate and other products  | 58                   | 3                    | (69)                   | (4)                    |\n| Equity and equity-linked products | 108                  | -                    | (116)                  | -                      |\n| Total                             | 279                  | 3                    | (258)                  | (4)                    |\n\nThe favourable and unfavourable changes from using reasonable possible alternative assumptions for the valuation of above product types have been calculated by recalibrating the valuation model using stressed significant unobservable inputs of the Consolidated Entity's range of reasonably possible estimates.",

Correlation is a key input into the valuation of derivatives with more than one underlying and is generally used to value hybrid and exotic instruments.\n\n## Volatility\n\nVolatility is a measure of the variability or uncertainty in returns for a given derivative underlying. It represents an estimate of the amount a particular underlying instrument, parameter or index will change in value over time. Volatility is an input into the valuation of derivatives containing optionality. Volatility and skew are impacted by the underlying risk, term and strike price of a derivative.\n\nCorrelations and volatilities are derived through the extrapolation of observable volatilities, recent transaction prices, quotes from other market participants, data from consensus pricing services and historical data adjusted for current conditions.\n\n## Inputs for equity and equity-linked products\n\nUnlisted equity securities are generally valued based on earnings or revenue multiples, referencing market transactions for comparable companies adjusted as appropriate for current economic conditions. Other significant unobservable inputs may include NAV and discount rates determined using inputs specific to the underlying investment and forecast cash flows and earnings/revenues of investee entities.\n\n## Inputs for interest rate products (discount rate)\n\nLoans are generally valued using discount rates. Significant unobservable inputs may include interest rates and credit spreads of counterparties and original issue discounts on primary debt issuances.\n\n- (1) The range of inputs related to NAV is not disclosed as the diverse nature of the underlying investments results in a wide range of inputs.",

The following tables provide information on the impact of offsetting of financial instruments in the Statements of financial position, as well as amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements that do not meet all the criteria for offsetting and therefore presented gross in the Statements of financial position. Enforceable netting arrangements may allow for net settlement of specified contracts with a counterparty only in the event of default or other pre-determined events, such that their potential effects on the Consolidated Entity and the Company's financial position in that circumstance is to settle these contracts as one arrangement. The Consolidated Entity uses a variety of credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral arrangements, therefore amounts presented in this note are not intended to represent the credit risk exposure of the entity, refer to Note 36.1 Credit risk for information on credit risk management.\n\n|                                                                     | AMOUNT SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE NETTING ARRANGEMENTS             | AMOUNT SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE NETTING ARRANGEMENTS             | AMOUNT SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE NETTING ARRANGEMENTS             | AMOUNT SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE NETTING ARRANGEMENTS   | AMOUNT SUBJECT TO ENFORCEABLE NETTING ARRANGEMENTS   |                |                                                               |                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                     | SUBJECT TO OFFSETTING IN THE  STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION | SUBJECT TO OFFSETTING IN THE  STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION | SUBJECT TO OFFSETTING IN THE  STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION | RELATED AMOUNT  NOT OFFSET (1)                       | RELATED AMOUNT  NOT OFFSET (1)                       |                |                                                               |                                             |\n|                                                                     | Gross  amount $m                                               | Amount  offset $m                                              | Net amount  presented $m                                       | Other  recognised  financial  instruments (2) $m     | Cash and  other  financial  collateral (3) $m        | Net  amount $m | Amount not  subject to  enforceable  netting  arrangements $m | Statements  of financial position  total $m |\n|                                                                     |                                                                |                                                                |                                                                |                                                      |                                                      |                | CONSOLIDATED 2022                                             | CONSOLIDATED 2022                           |\n| Cash collateralised lending  and reverse repurchase  agreements (4) | 47,594                                                         | (1,346)                                                        | 46,248                                                         | (28)                                                 | (46,057)                                             | 163            | 4,949                                                         | 51,197                                      |\n| Settlement assets (4),(5)                                           | 13,076                                                         | (8,903)                                                        | 4,173                                                          | (43)                                                 | -

Depending on the criteria discussed in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments, the Consolidated Entity may be unable to derecognise the transferred asset, be able to derecognise the transferred assets in full or continue to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are derecognised\n\nWhen financial assets are derecognised, some continuing involvement may be retained in the assets in the form of liquidity support, financial guarantees, certain derivatives or retention of part of securitisation interests. For the financial years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, there were no material transfers of financial assets where the Consolidated Entity has had continuing involvement.\n\n## Transferred financial assets that are not derecognised\n\nThe Consolidated Entity did not derecognise any financial assets to the extent of continuing involvement in the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021. The following transactions typically result in the transferred assets continuing to be recognised in full.\n\n## Repurchase and securities lending agreements\n\nSecurities and commodities sold under an agreement to repurchase and securities subject to lending agreements continue to be recognised in the Statements of financial position and an associated liability is recognised for the consideration received.\n\nWhere securities are transferred in return for the loan of other securities or on an unsecured basis in return for a fee, the transferred asset continues to be recognised in full. There is no associated liability as the securities received are not recognised on the balance sheet. The Consolidated entity is unable to use, sell or pledge the transferred assets for the duration of the transaction and remains exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk on these assets.\n\nIn certain arrangements the transferee cannot otherwise sell or pledge the transferred securities, however, the assets may be substituted if the required collateral is maintained.\n\n## Financial investment-Total return swap\n\nFinancial assets sold, while concurrently entering into a total return swap with the counterparty, continue to be recognised along with an associated liability for the consideration received. The Consolidated Entity does not have legal rights to these assets but has full economic exposure to them. The transferred assets cannot otherwise be pledged or sold by the transferee.\n\n## Other financial transfers\n\nIncludes loans and leases sold or lent to an external funder but the Consolidated Entity still has full economic exposure to them. In such instances, the Consolidated Entity has a right to receive cash from the lessee and an obligations to pay those cash flows to the external funder.",

('Waddell and Reed'), a publicly traded US asset manager providing wealth management and asset management services, for a consideration of $1,657 million (net of $356 million received on the sale of the wealth management business to LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and net of certain other liabilities acquired, which were settled immediately after the acquisition). On acquisition, goodwill and other intangible assets of $1,223 million were recognised net of the related deferred tax liability. Post-acquisition of Waddell and Reed, the Consolidated entity's net operating income for the year ended 31 March 2022 increased by $822 million and profit before income tax after acquisition-related costs, amortisation of intangible assets and integration costs, decreased by $44 million. Had the Consolidated Entity acquired control of Waddell and Reed on 1 April 2021, the Consolidated Entity's net operating income for the year ended 31 March 2022, excluding the sold wealth management business, would have increased by $79 million and profit before income tax by $25 million.\n\nThe subsidiaries and businesses where control was acquired during the current and previous financial year were not individually significant.\n\nSubsidiaries and businesses acquired or consolidated during the current financial year due to the acquisition of control were: AMP Capital (GEFI), Central Park Group LLC, Gana Energy Ltd., Procentrix, Inc., Radzyn Clearn Energy Poland Sp.

Subsidiaries are all those entities (including structured entities) which the Consolidated Entity controls. The Consolidated Entity controls an entity where it has:\n\n- \u00b7 exposure, or rights, to variable returns, and\n- \u00b7 power to direct the relevant activities\n- \u00b7 the ability to utilise power to affect the entity's returns.\n\nThe determination of control is based on current facts and circumstances and is continuously assessed. The Consolidated Entity has power over an entity when it has existing substantive rights that provide it with the current ability to direct the entity's relevant activities, being those activities that significantly affect the entity's returns. The Consolidated Entity also considers the entity's purpose and design. If the Consolidated Entity determines that it has power over an entity, the Consolidated Entity then evaluates its exposure, or rights, to variable returns by considering the magnitude and variability associated with its economic interests.\n\nAll variable returns are considered in making that assessment including, but not limited to, returns from debt or equity investments, guarantees, liquidity arrangements, variable fees and certain derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Consolidated Entity has determined that it controls entities that it has less than half of the voting rights on the basis of its ability to direct the relevant activities of those entities.\n\n## Structured entities\n\nStructured Entities (SEs) are those entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities of the SE are directed by means of contractual arrangements. When assessing whether the Consolidated Entity controls (and therefore consolidates) a SE, judgement is required as to whether the Consolidated Entity has power over the relevant activities as well as exposure, or rights, to variable returns of the SE.\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity has power over the SE's relevant activities, has assessed that its exposure to variable returns (through the residual risk associated with its involvement in SEs) is sufficient, and is able to affect its returns, the underlying assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of these SEs are reported in the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 34 Structured entities for further information related to both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe effects of all transactions between subsidiaries in the Consolidated Entity are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same manner as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated Statements of financial position and are determined on the basis of the Consolidated Entity's present ownership interest in the entity.\n\nWhere control of an entity was obtained during the financial year, its results are included in the consolidated income statement from the date on which control was obtained. Where control of an entity ceased during the financial year, its results are included for that part of the financial year during which control existed.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining control (i.e. acquisition date) and losing control (i.e. disposal date) of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to direct the relevant activities and the extent of the Consolidated Entity's exposure to the entity's variable returns. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\n\nSubsidiaries held by the Company are carried in its financial statements at cost less accumulated impairment.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (i) Principles of consolidation continued\n\n## Interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are entities over which the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control. Existing ownership interests (including in substance ownership interests) in associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method. In-substance ownership interests are interests that are substantially similar to an investee's ordinary shares. Equity accounting of the ownership interests is applied from the date that the Consolidated Entity has significant influence or joint control and ceases when the Consolidated Entity no longer has significant influence or joint control.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity determines the dates of obtaining or losing significant influence or joint control of another entity based on an assessment of all pertinent facts and circumstances that affect the ability to significantly influence the financial and operating policies or jointly control the relevant activities of that entity. Facts and circumstances that have the most impact include the contractual arrangements agreed with the counterparty, the manner in which those arrangements are expected to operate in practice, and whether regulatory approval is required (including the nature of such approval). The acquisition or disposal date does not necessarily occur when the transaction is closed or finalised under law.\n\nThe equity method of accounting is applied in the consolidated Financial Report and requires the recognition of the Consolidated Entity's share of its associates' and joint ventures' post acquisition profits or loss (including impairments of the associates' or joint ventures' assets) in the consolidated income statement, and the share of the post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Transactions reported directly in equity (besides those reflected in other comprehensive income) are accounted for by the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the substance of the transaction and whether the transaction is dilutive to the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest. Where the transaction is dilutive, the impact is recorded as part of the Consolidated Entity's share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\nEquity accounting of losses is restricted to the Consolidated Entity's interests in its associate or joint venture, unless the Consolidated Entity has an obligation or has made payment on behalf of the entity.\n\nLong-term interests in an associate or joint venture, to which the equity method is not applied but in-substance form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture, are accounted for in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' accounting policies, which includes accounting for expected credit losses, where applicable. Subsequently, the loss allocation and impairment requirements in AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures are applied to long-term interests.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, management reviews the Consolidated Entity's investments in associates and joint ventures for indicators of impairment. Where there is an indicator of impairment, the carrying amount of the investment is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying value. Impairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A reversal of a previously recognised impairment loss is recognised only to the extent that the investment's carrying value does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (including consideration of any equity accounted losses) if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale when the Consolidated Entity determines that the interest will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Equity accounting is suspended when the interest is classified as held for sale.\n\nOn disposal of an investment in an associate or a joint venture, the difference between the sales consideration, any retained interest and the carrying value is recognised as a gain or loss in investment income as part of other operating income and charges together with any gains and losses in OCI that related to the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Changes in ownership interests\n\nWhen acquiring additional interests:\n\n- \u00b7 in an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a subsidiary), where the underlying entity constitutes a business,\n- \u00b7 of a financial asset (such that it becomes an associate, joint venture or subsidiary), or\n\npreviously held interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part other operating income and charges.\n\nSimilarly, when selling ownership interests of a subsidiary (such that control is lost), or an investment in an associate or joint venture (such that it becomes a financial asset), retained ownership interests are revalued to their fair value and any gain or loss is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges. Retained ownership interests are not revalued where the sale represents a contribution to an associate or joint venture.\n\nIncreases and decreases in the Consolidated Entity's interest in a subsidiary (that do not result in the loss of control) are accounted for directly within equity. Increases in the Consolidated Entity's ownership interest in an associate or joint venture are accounted for as an increase in the carrying value of the interest in associate or joint venture. The difference between the reduction in the Consolidated Entity's interest in an associate or joint venture that remains an associate or joint venture and the fair value of consideration received is accounted for as a gain or loss within investment income as part of other operating income and charges. A proportionate amount of associated OCI is reclassified to profit or loss, or reclassified within equity, as would otherwise be required on disposal of the underlying position.",

The Consolidated Entity identifies a business where an acquired integrated set of activities and assets includes an economic resource (input) and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to provide goods or services to customers, generate investment income or other income from ordinary activities (outputs).\n\nOn a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Consolidated Entity may use a practical expedient to determine that an acquired set of activities is not a business. Under this assessment, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration exchanged is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred. Transaction costs of a business combination are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement as part of other operating expenses.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. The Consolidated Entity elects, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, to initially measure NCI either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration exchanged, recognised NCI, and the fair value of previously held equity interests over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired and is recognised as part of intangible assets in the Statements of financial position. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.\n\nIf the consideration is less than the Consolidated Entity's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\nContingent consideration that is dependent on any subsequent event is measured at fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present values as at the acquisition date. The discount rate used is the Consolidated Entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of each entity (including branches) in the Consolidated Entity is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The Consolidated Entity and the Company's financial statements are presented in Australian dollars (the presentation currency), which is also the Company's functional currency.\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nAt initial recognition, a foreign currency transaction is translated into the entity's functional currency using the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period:\n\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items (including equity) measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency remain translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction, and\n- \u00b7 foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date that the fair value was measured.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement or translation of monetary items, or non-monetary items measured at fair value are recognised in net trading income, with one exception. Where such monetary items are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying cash flow hedge or net investment hedge relationships, the foreign exchange gains and losses may be deferred in OCI to the extent the hedge is effective (refer to Note 35 Hedge accounting and Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities ) .\n\n## Subsidiaries and other entities\n\nThe results and financial position of all entities that have a functional currency other than Australian dollars are translated into Australian dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 income and expenses for each income statement are translated at actual or average exchange rates at the dates of the transactions\n- \u00b7 assets and liabilities for each Statements of financial position presented are translated at the closing exchange rate at the date of that Statements of financial position. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and are translated at the closing exchange rate\n- \u00b7 all resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI within a separate component of reserves, being the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR).",

        "page_content": "## Note 44\n\nSignificant accounting policies\n\ncontinued\n\n## (iii) Foreign currency translation continued\n\nForeign currency gains and losses on intragroup loans are recognised in the income statement except where the loan is in substance part of the Consolidated Entity's net investment in the foreign operation, in which case the foreign currency gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Entity's FCTR.\n\nThe exchange gains or losses recognised in FCTR are reclassified to the income statement or reattributed within equity as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is an associate or joint arrangement, without loss of significant influence or joint control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reclassified to investment income\n- \u00b7 if there is a disposal of a foreign operation, then the accumulated FCTR is reclassified from OCI to investment income within other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 if there is a partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary, without loss of control, then a proportionate share of the accumulated FCTR is reattributed within equity to non-controlling interests.\n\n## (iv) Revenue and expense recognition\n\n## Net interest income\n\nInterest income and interest expense (with the exception of borrowing costs that are capitalised on a qualifying asset which is not measured at fair value) are recognised using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost, and debt financial assets classified as at fair value through OCI. The EIR method calculates the amortised cost of a financial instrument at a rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. The calculation of the EIR does not include ECL. Fees and transaction costs that are integral to the lending arrangement are recognised in interest income or interest expense, as applicable, over the expected life (or, when appropriate, a shorter period) of the instrument in accordance with the EIR method.\n\nWhen the estimates of payments or receipts of a financial instrument are subsequently revised, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect the actual or revised cash flows with the remeasurement recognised as part of interest income (financial assets) or interest expense (financial liabilities).\n\nInterest income on financial assets that are not credit impaired is determined by applying the financial asset's EIR to the financial asset's gross carrying amount. Interest income on financial assets that are subsequently classified as credit-impaired (stage III), is recognised by applying the EIR to the amortised cost carrying value (being the gross carrying value after deducting the impairment loss).\n\nInterest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities that are classified as FVTPL is accounted for on a contractual rate basis.\n\n## Fee and commission income\n\nRevenue earned by the Consolidated Entity from its contracts with customers primarily consists of the following categories of fee and commission income:\n\nBase and other asset management fees, and performance fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns base and other asset management and performance fees for providing asset management services for listed and unlisted funds, managed accounts and co-investments arrangements. It has been determined that the provision of asset management services is typically a single performance obligation.\n\nBase management fees are recognised over the life of the contract as the asset management services are provided. Any associated performance fees are deemed to be a variable component of the same asset management service and are recognised only when it is highly probable that the performance hurdles are met, and a significant reversal of cumulative fees recognised to date will not occur. Determining the amount and timing of performance fees to be recognised involves judgement, the use of estimates (including management estimates of underlying asset values) and consideration of a number of criteria relating to both the fund or managed account in which the asset(s) are held, as well as the underlying asset(s), such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the proportion of assets realised and returns on those assets\n- \u00b7 the extent to which performance fee liabilities have been accrued by the fund or managed account to date or consideration of the current valuation case of the assets in relation to the related performance fee hurdle rate\n- \u00b7 nature of remaining underlying fund or managed account's assets and potential downside valuation risks on each\n- \u00b7 consideration of the ability to dispose of the asset, including any barriers to divest.\n- \u00b7 time remaining until realisation of the assets and the fund's life or asset management services' timeline\n\nMergers and acquisitions, advisory and underwriting fees\n\nThe Consolidated Entity earns revenue through its role as advisor on corporate transactions as well as through its role as manager and underwriter of equity and debt issuances. The revenue from these arrangements is recognised at a point in time, and when it has been established that the customer has received the benefit of the service such that the performance obligation is satisfied. For advisory services this is typically at the time of closing the transaction.\n\nWhere mandates contain rights to invoice upon reaching certain milestones, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether distinct services have been transferred at these milestones and accordingly recognises revenue. If not, the fee recognition will be deferred until such time as the performance obligation has been completed. Management of capital raisings and underwriting of debt or equity capital raisings are each considered distinct performance obligations that are typically satisfied on the allocation date of the underwritten securities.",

The brokerage and commission income related to this service is recognised on trade date and is presented net of any rebates.\n\n## Other fee and commission income\n\nOther fee and commission income includes fees earned on a range of banking products and services platforms, wealth services, credit cards, structuring fees, lending services, stock borrow and lending activities and income on structured products which is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied.\n\n## Net operating lease income\n\nOperating lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is presented net of the related depreciation expense.\n\n## Other operating income and charges\n\nOther operating income and charges includes investment income, and other income.\n\nInvestment income includes gains and losses arising from subsequent changes in the fair values of equity and debt investment securities that are classified as FVTPL and dividends or distributions on these securities which represent the return on such investments. Impairment losses/reversal of impairment losses on these financial assets are not reported separately.\n\nGains or losses on the change of control, joint control and/or significant influence and reclassifications to/from held for sale also forms part of investment income. Refer to Note 44(i) Principles of consolidation for details on the timing of recognition of such gains or losses.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends or distributions are recognised when the right to receive a dividend or distribution is established, it is probable the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company and/ or Consolidated Entity and the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\nDividends or distributions from HFT assets are recognised in net trading income, as investment income as part of other operating income and charges for other financial assets measured at FVTPL or FVOCI, or as a reduction to the carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures in the Consolidated Entity's Statements of financial position. Where associates and joint ventures are classified as held for sale, dividends or distributions are recognised within other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nJudgement is applied in determining whether distributions from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are to be recognised as dividend income or as a return of capital. Distributions that represent a return of capital are accounted for by the Company as a reduction to the cost of its investment and are otherwise\n\nrecognised by the Company within investment income as part of other operating income and charges when the recognition criteria are met.\n\n## Expenses\n\nExpenses are recognised in the income statement as and when the provision of services is received.\n\n## (v) Segment reporting\n\nOperating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports to Senior Management about components of the Consolidated Entity that are regularly reviewed by Senior Management who have been identified as the chief operating decision makers, in order to allocate resources to the segment and to assess its performance. Information reported to Senior Management for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance is specifically focused on core products and services offered, comprising five reportable segments as disclosed in Note 3 Segment reporting.\n\nInformation about products and services is based on the financial information used to produce the Consolidated Entity's financial statements. Information about geographical segments is based on the jurisdiction of the respective entities.\n\n## (vi) Taxation\n\nThe balance sheet approach to tax effect accounting has been adopted whereby the income tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and unused tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised when temporary differences arise between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective carrying amounts which give rise to a future tax benefit, or when a benefit arises due to unused tax losses. In both cases, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available against which to utilise those temporary differences or tax losses.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised when such temporary differences give rise to taxable amounts that are payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered, or the liabilities are settled under enacted or substantively enacted tax law.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset and an intention to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes attributable to amounts recognised in OCI are also recognised in OCI.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether deferred tax assets, particularly in relation to tax losses, are probable of recovery.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (vi) Taxation continued\n\nFactors considered include the ability to offset tax losses within the tax consolidated group in Australia or groups of entities in overseas jurisdictions, the nature of the tax loss, the length of time that tax losses are eligible for carry forward to offset against future taxable profits and whether future taxable profits are expected to be sufficient to allow recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity undertakes transactions in the ordinary course of business where the income tax treatment requires the exercise of judgement. The Consolidated Entity estimates the amount expected to be paid to/(recovered from) tax authorities based on its understanding and interpretation of the law. Uncertain tax positions are presented as current or deferred tax assets or liabilities with reference to the nature of the underlying uncertainty.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity's Australian tax liabilities are determined according to tax consolidation legislation.\n\nThe Company, together with all eligible Australian resident wholly owned subsidiaries, comprise a tax consolidated group (TCG) with the Company as the head entity. As a consequence, the relevant subsidiaries are not liable to make income tax payments and do not recognise any current tax balances or any deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or credits.\n\nThe TCG recognises its current and deferred taxes using the 'group allocation approach' detailed in AASB UIG Interpretation 1052 Tax Consolidation Accounting. Under the terms and conditions of a tax funding agreement, the Company charges each subsidiary for all current tax liabilities incurred in respect of their activities and reimburses each subsidiary for any tax assets arising from unused tax losses.\n\nShould the Company be in default of its tax payment obligations, or a default is probable, the current tax balances of its subsidiaries will be determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of a tax sharing agreement between the Company and entities in the TCG.\n\n## Goods and Services tax (GST)\n\nWhere GST (or other value added tax) is not recoverable from global tax authorities, it is either capitalised to the Statements of financial position as part of the cost of the related asset or is recognised as part of other operating expenses. Where GST (or other value added tax) is recoverable from or payable to global tax authorities, the amount is recorded as a separate asset or liability in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## (vii) Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are recognised when the Consolidated Entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nA financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value and is adjusted (in the case of instruments not classified at FVTPL) for transaction costs that are incremental and directly attributable to\n\nthe acquisition or issuance of the financial instrument, and fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs and fees paid or received relating to financial instruments carried at FVTPL are recorded in the income statement.\n\nThe best evidence of a financial instruments' fair value at initial recognition is its transaction price, unless its fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique for which variables include only inputs from observable markets. Where such alternative evidence exists, the Consolidated Entity recognises profit or loss immediately when the instrument is recognised ('day 1 profit or loss'). When significant unobservable inputs are used to determine fair value, the day 1 profit or loss is deferred and is recognised in net trading income over the life of the transaction or when the inputs become observable.\n\nFinancial instruments arising in multiple transactions are accounted for as a single arrangement if this best reflects the substance of the arrangement. Factors considered in this assessment include whether the financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 have the same counterparty\n- \u00b7 are entered into at the same time and in contemplation of one another\n- \u00b7 relate to the same risk\n- \u00b7 whether each of the financial instruments has its own terms and conditions and may be transferred or settled separately.\n- \u00b7 there is no apparent economic need or substantive business purpose for structuring the transactions separately that could not also have been accomplished in a single transaction, or\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised from the Statements of financial position when:\n\n- \u00b7 the Consolidated Entity has transferred the financial asset such that it has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset.\n- \u00b7 the rights to cash flows have expired, or\n\nA financial asset is transferred if, and only if, the Consolidated Entity i) transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, or ii) retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in an arrangement where the Consolidated Entity is:\n\n- \u00b7 prohibited from selling or pledging the original asset other than as security to the eventual recipients, and\n- \u00b7 not obligated to pay amounts to the eventual recipients unless it collects equivalent amounts from the original asset\n- \u00b7 obligated to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the eventual recipients without material delay.\n\nIn transactions where the Consolidated Entity neither retains nor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a financial asset, the asset is derecognised if control over the asset is lost. Any interest in the transferred and derecognised financial asset that is created or retained by the Consolidated Entity is recognised as a separate asset or liability.",

The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n- \u00b7 the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under AASB 9, or\n\n## Modification of financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is modified when its original contractual cash flows are renegotiated or modified. A financial asset that is renegotiated is derecognised if the rights to receive cash flows from the existing agreement have expired, either through replacement by a new agreement or the existing terms are modified to that effect. A financial liability that is renegotiated is derecognised if the existing agreement is cancelled and a new agreement is made on substantially different terms or if the existing terms are modified such that the renegotiated financial instrument is a substantially different financial instrument. Where the modification results in derecognition of the original financial instrument, the new financial instrument is recorded initially at its fair value and the resulting difference is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the nature of the financial instrument as described in the derecognition of financial instruments policy.\n\nFor financial instruments measured at amortised cost, and for debt financial assets measured at FVOCI, when the modification does not result in derecognition, a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the nature of the financial instrument as described in the derecognition of financial instruments policy.\n\nThe gain or loss is measured as the adjustment of the gross carrying amount to reflect the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the instrument's original EIR.\n\n## Classification and subsequent measurement\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified based on the business model within which the asset is held and on the basis of the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics.\n\n## Business model assessment\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses judgement in determining the business model at the level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed and its intention with respect to its financial assets. In determining the business model, all relevant evidence that is available at the date of the assessment is used including:\n\n- \u00b7 the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and, in particular, the way in which those risks are managed, and\n- \u00b7 how the performance of the financial assets held within that business model is evaluated and reported to the Consolidated Entity's Senior Management personnel and senior executives\n- \u00b7 how managers of the business are compensated (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected).\n\n## Solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI)\n\nThe contractual cash flows of a financial asset are assessed to determine whether these represent SPPI on the principal amount outstanding consistent with a basic lending arrangement. This includes an assessment of whether the cash flows primarily reflect consideration for the time value of money and credit risk of the principal outstanding. Interest may also include consideration for other basic lending risks and costs.\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method where:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.\n\nInterest income is determined in accordance with the EIR method and recognised as part of interest and similar income.\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at FVOCI if the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that meet the SPPI requirements\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to both collect contractual cash flows and to sell the financial asset\n- \u00b7 the financial asset has not been classified as DFVTPL.",

When debt financial assets classified as at FVOCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from OCI to investment income in respect of debt financial investments and loans to associates, or to other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges for all other financial assets.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets that do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI are subsequently measured at FVTPL.\n\nFor the purposes of the Consolidated Entity's financial statements, the FVTPL classification consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets in a business model whose objective is achieved by managing the financial assets on a fair value basis in order to realise gains and losses as opposed to a business model in which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows (FVTPL)\n- \u00b7 financial assets that are held for active trading (held for trading (HFT)). This classification includes all derivative financial assets, except those that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL\n- \u00b7 financial assets that fail the SPPI test (FVTPL), and\n- \u00b7 financial assets that have been designated to be measured at fair value through profit or loss to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch (DFVTPL).\n\nEquity financial assets that are not held for active trading are measured at FVTPL. Subsequent changes in fair value are recognised as investment income within other operating income and charges.\n\nSubsequent changes in the fair value of debt financial assets measured at FVTPL are presented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of debt financial investments and loans to associates and joint ventures that fail SPPI are recognised in investment income as part of other operating income and charges\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial assets that are classified as HFT and financial assets managed on a fair value basis are recognised in net trading income\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of all other FVTPL and DFVTPL financial assets are recognised as part of other income and charges within other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial assets is recognised as interest and similar income.\n\n## Reclassification of financial instruments\n\nThe Consolidated Entity reclassifies debt financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes. Financial assets that are reclassified are subsequently measured based on the financial asset's new measurement category.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity does not reclassify financial liabilities after initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, unless they are either HFT, or have been designated to be measured at FVTPL (DFVTPL). A financial liability may be DFVTPL if:\n\n- \u00b7 a group of financial liabilities, or financial assets and financial liabilities, is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy, or\n- \u00b7 such a designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise have arisen\n- \u00b7 the liability contains embedded derivatives which must otherwise be separated and carried at fair value.\n\nAll derivative financial liabilities are classified as HFT, except those that are designated as hedging instruments in qualifying hedge relationships and are classified as FVTPL. Refer to Note 44(x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities for the detailed hedge accounting policy.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial liabilities that are not classified as HFT, with the exception of changes in fair value relating to changes in the Consolidated Entity's own credit risk that are presented separately in OCI and are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss, are recognised in other income and charges as part of other operating income and charges.\n\nWhere applicable, the interest component of these financial liabilities is recognised as interest and similar expense.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount reported in the Statements of financial position, when there is a current legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and either there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the financial asset and settle the financial liability simultaneously.",

The underlying that is subject to the arrangement is not derecognised from the Statements of financial position of the relevant parties, as the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the initial holder.\n\nThese transactions include:\n\n- \u00b7 repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity sells an underlying under an agreement to repurchase.\n- \u00b7 reverse repurchase transactions, where the Consolidated Entity purchases an underlying under an agreement to resell\n\nThe Consolidated Entity continually reviews the fair values of the underlying on which the above transactions are based and where appropriate, requests or provides additional collateral to support the transactions, in accordance with the terms of the respective agreements.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements are measured as follows by the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 agreements that are held within the Consolidated Entity's cash and liquid assets portfolio are measured at FVOCI as they are held in a business model to both collect contractual cash flows and with the intention to sell\n- \u00b7 agreements that are collateralised with commodities are measured at amortised cost when they are held in a business model to collect contractual cash flows and AASB 9's SPPI criteria are met\n- \u00b7 all other reverse repurchase agreements are measured at FVTPL to reflect the Consolidated Entity's business model to realise fair value gains and losses as opposed to a business model in which the objective is to collect contractual cash flows.\n\nAlso refer to Note 37 Measurement categories of financial instruments.\n\nRepurchase agreements are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except where they are DFVTPL to eliminate an accounting mismatch created by managing the agreements together with the associated reverse repurchase agreements that are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## (ix) Trading assets and liabilities\n\nThe Consolidated Entity uses trade date accounting when recording regular way purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities that are classified as HFT. At the date a purchase transaction is entered into (trade date), the Consolidated Entity recognises the resulting financial asset or liability and any subsequent unrealised gain or loss arising from revaluing that contract to fair value as part of net trading income, except for interest income on HFT debt financial assets which is recognised in interest income. Refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\nTrading assets (long positions) comprise financial instruments such as debt and equity securities, bank bills, treasury notes, and loans, commodity contracts and commodities purchased with the intent of being actively traded either individually or as part of a portfolio.\n\nTrading liabilities comprise obligations to deliver assets (short positions) across the same trading categories and which the Consolidated Entity intends to actively trade.\n\nCommodity inventory is recognised when the Consolidated Entity controls the commodity, the determination of which includes consideration of price risk, and is measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption, on the basis that such assets are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity becomes party to a sale contract, and the derecognition criteria are met (refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments) , it derecognises the trading asset or liability and recognises a trade receivable or trade payable from trade date until settlement date.\n\n## (x) Derivative instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivative instruments entered into by the Consolidated Entity include futures, forwards and forward rate agreements, swaps and options in the interest rate, foreign exchange, commodity, credit and equity markets. These derivative instruments are principally used by the Consolidated Entity for the purposes of risk management of existing financial assets and liabilities and forecast transactions and are also entered into for client trading purposes.\n\nDerivatives are recognised in the Statements of financial position as an asset where they have a positive fair value at the reporting date or as a liability where they have a negative fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDerivatives that may have both positive or negative values must meet both the asset and liability derecognition tests before being derecognised from the Statements of financial position.\n\nFair values are obtained from quoted prices in active markets where available, or valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, as appropriate. The accounting for derivatives is subject to the application of the day 1 profit or loss policy as described in Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity applies trade date accounting to the recognition and derecognition of derivative financial instruments.",

Margin monies primarily represent deposits placed with clearing houses in relation to futures trading and other derivatives transactions. The balance includes both initial and variance margin which varies based on trading activities. The balance also includes client margin calls which are funded by the Consolidated Entity. Settlement balances represent outstanding trade timing balances as at the reporting date due to the timing difference between trade and settlement date. Balances are carried at amortised cost except for certain margin money balances that are held in money market funds and certain settlement balances which are carried at FVTPL.\n\n## (xii) Financial investments\n\nInvestment securities in this category include investments in equity or debt securities which are not actively traded by the Consolidated Entity.\n\nDebt investment securities in this category comprise bonds, negotiable certificates of deposits (NCD), floating rate notes (FRN), commercial paper and other debt securities.\n\nFinancial investments are initially recognised on trade date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for debt investments subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\n## (xiii) Loan Assets\n\nThis category includes loans that are not held for trading purposes and typically includes the Consolidated Entity's lending activities to its customers.\n\nLoan assets are initially recognised on settlement date at fair value (adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs for loan assets subsequently measured at amortised cost or FVOCI) and subsequently measured in accordance with Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\nCertain finance lease receivables are also presented as part of asset financing within loan assets. For the detailed policy on financial instruments, including treatment of derecognition, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\n## (xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost (which includes, where applicable, directly attributable borrowing costs and expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset) less, accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, accumulated impairment losses.\n\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets are initially measured at cost and comprise of the amount that corresponds to the amount recognised for the lease liability on initial recognition together with any lease payments made at or before the commencement date (less any lease incentives received), initial direct costs and restoration-related costs. Subsequently, it is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and, where applicable, impairment losses, and adjusted for remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets includes assets leased out under operating leases.\n\nDepreciation is the process to allocate the difference between cost and residual values over the estimated useful life. Where the residual value exceeds the carrying value, no depreciation is charged. Depreciation is calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 unit of production method for certain infrastructure assets\n- \u00b7 diminishing balance method for aviation assets\n- \u00b7 straight-line basis for all other assets.\n\nA ROU asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term.\n\nAnnual depreciation rates are summarised below:\n\n| Property, plant and equipment                      | Depreciation rates   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Buildings                                          | 2 to 3.3%            |\n| Furniture, fittings and leasehold improvements (1) | 10 to 20%            |\n| Equipment                                          | 33 to 50%            |\n| Infrastructure assets (2)                          | 1 to 33%             |\n| Aviation (3)                                       | 2 to 8%              |\n| Meters                                             | 5 to 15%             |\n| Telecommunications                                 | 24.5 to 41.4%        |\n| Other operating lease assets                       | 2 to 25%             |\n\nUseful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed annually and reassessed in the light of commercial and technological developments. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing the proceeds with the asset's carrying amount and are recognised in other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\n(2)\n\nIncludes infrastructure assets, for which depreciation is calculated on a unit of production basis.\n\n(3)  Includes aircraft, for which depreciation is calculated on a diminishing value basis.",

Goodwill arising from business combinations is included in intangible assets in the Statements of financial position.\n\n## Other acquired identifiable intangible assets\n\nAt the time at which the Consolidated Entity determines that it has acquired a business, the Consolidated Entity identifies intangible assets that are required to be initially recognised at fair value. An intangible asset is considered to have an indefinite useful life where it is expected to contribute to the Consolidated Entity's net cash inflows indefinitely.\n\nThe following intangible assets are typically identified and recognised by the Consolidated Entity:\n\n- \u00b7 management rights: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Certain management right intangible assets, which have indefinite useful lives as the underlying income stream is related to the management of funds that have no defined end date and are expected to operate perpetually, are not amortised. For management rights that have a finite useful life, amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of management rights over the estimated useful life usually being a period not exceeding 20 years\n- \u00b7 licences and trading rights: generally carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. Where no contractual or legal limitation exists, these assets are not amortised because they are considered to have an indefinite useful life\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts acquired with a finite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Amortisation is calculated over the period for which the customer relationship is expected to exist\n- \u00b7 customer and servicing contracts with an indefinite useful life: carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss.\n\nCertain other intangible assets held for trading, including emission certificates, are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker-trader exemption (on the basis that such assets are acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price or broker traders' margin).\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets held by trading related business is recorded in net trading income and for others is recognised in other operating expenses. Impairments (reversal of impairments) of intangible assets are recognised in other impairment charges/reversal.\n\n## Software\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring and developing certain computer software programmes are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life, usually a period of three to seven years on a straight-line basis. The capitalised software asset is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis.\n\nCosts incurred on the maintenance of software is expensed as incurred and recognised in other operating expenses.\n\n## (xvi) Deposits\n\nDeposits include customer deposits, business banking and home loan related deposits, deposits from financial institutions and other balances such as client monies. These deposits are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (xvii) Other assets and liabilities\n\n## Contract assets, contract liabilities and capitalised expenses\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity provides services to clients and the consideration is unconditional, a receivable is recognised. Where the consideration is conditional on something other than the passage of time, such as performance fees, these are recorded as contract assets. Both receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with AASB 9.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity, as permitted by AASB 15, has applied the practical expedient that allows for costs incurred to obtain a contract to be expensed as incurred where the amortisation period for any asset recognised would be less than 12 months. The Consolidated Entity also applies the practical expedient not to adjust consideration for the effects of a significant financing component, where the period between transferring a good or service and when the customer pays for that good or service is expected to be one year or less.\n\nContract liabilities relate to prepayments received from customers where the Consolidated Entity is yet to satisfy its performance obligation.",

This includes assets and liabilities of businesses and subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, other assets and liabilities, and subsidiaries that are acquired exclusively with a view to sell or distribute.\n\nThese assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale when they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale or distribution is highly probable, including that the sale or distribution is expected to occur within 12 months. Where there is a planned partial disposal of a subsidiary resulting in loss of control, but the Consolidated Entity retains an interest in the disposed subsidiary, the entire carrying value of the subsidiary's assets and liabilities is classified as held for sale.\n\nNon-current assets and liabilities of disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Equity accounting, depreciation and amortisation is suspended when the held for sale criteria are met.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write down of the asset to fair value less costs to sell and is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell, limited to the cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of sale is recognised at the date of sale.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale are measured in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's financial instruments' policies.\n\n## Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised when it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle a present legal or constructive obligation that has arisen as a result of past events and for which a reliable estimate can be made.\n\nContingent liabilities, which generally include letters of credit, indemnities, performance-related contingents and guarantees (other than financial guarantees) are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements unless they are considered remote.\n\n## Employee benefit provisions\n\nEmployee benefit provisions are recognised by the Consolidated Entity as and when the service has been rendered after deducting amounts already paid. Liabilities for unpaid salaries, salary-related costs and provisions for annual leave are recorded in the Statements of financial position at the salary rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Provisions for long service leave and other long-term benefits are recognised at the present value of expected future payments to be made.\n\nIn determining this amount, consideration is given to expected future salary levels and employee service histories. Expected future payments are discounted to their net present value using discount rates on high quality corporate bonds, except where there is no deep market, in which case rates on Government securities are used. Such discount rates have terms that match as closely as possible the expected future cash flows.\n\nProvisions for unpaid employee benefits are derecognised when the benefit is settled or is transferred to another entity and the Company and Consolidated Entity are legally released from the obligation and do not retain a constructive obligation.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWhere a dividend is determined or resolved by the Company's Board of Directors, consideration is given to the record date when determining the date on which the provision for the dividend is recognised in the Statements of financial position as a liability, with a corresponding reduction in retained earnings.\n\n## (xviii) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings include loans and other payables due to banks and financial institutions. These balances are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (xix) Due to/from subsidiaries\n\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries principally arise from the provision of lending arrangements and acceptance of funds on deposit, intercompany services and transactions and the provision of financial guarantees, and are accounted for in accordance with Note 44(iv) Revenue and expense recognition and Note 44(vii) Financial instruments. Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net where the offsetting requirements are met (Note 44(vii)), such that the net amount is reported in the Statements of financial position.",

        "page_content": "## Note 44\n\nSignificant accounting policies\n\n## continued\n\n## (xx) Debt issued\n\nDebt issued includes debt securities issued by the Consolidated Entity. These balances are subsequently measured at either amortised cost or are DFVTPL and measured at fair value in accordance with the Consolidated Entity's accounting policy for financial instruments, refer to Note 44(vii) Financial instruments.\n\n## (xxi) Loan capital\n\nLoan capital represents issued debt with terms and conditions that qualify for inclusion as capital under Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) Standards.\n\nCapital instruments are first assessed to determine whether the Consolidated Entity is required to deliver cash or another financial asset on the occurrence of a contingent event that is considered genuine and is beyond the control of both the issuer and the holder (such as Common Equity Tier 1 Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events). Where such a contingent event exists, the Consolidated Entity does not have the unconditional right to avoid delivering cash or another financial asset and the capital instrument is classified as a financial liability. The financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and is subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nFor compound instruments that have both equity and liability features, the liability component is initially measured at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs (and is thereafter measured at amortised cost using the EIR method), with the residual being accounted for within the Consolidated Entity's equity.\n\n## (xxii) Impairment\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nThe ECL requirements apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, lease receivables, amounts receivable from contracts with customers, loan commitments, certain letters of credit and financial guarantee contracts issued that are not DFVTPL. The Consolidated Entity applies a three-stage approach to measuring the ECL based on changes in the financial asset's underlying credit risk and includes forward looking information (FLI).\n\nThe calculation of ECL requires judgement and the choice of inputs, estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 13 Expected credit losses for further information. Outcomes within the next financial period that are different from management's assumptions and estimates could result in changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised.\n\nThe ECL is determined with reference to the following stages:\n\n## (i) Stage I-12 month ECL\n\nAt initial recognition, and for financial assets for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, ECL is determined based on the probability of default (PD) over the next 12 months and the lifetime losses associated with such PD, adjusted for FLI. Stage I also includes financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from stage II.\n\n## (ii) Stage II-Not credit-impaired\n\nWhen there has been a SICR since initial recognition, the ECL is determined with reference to the financial asset's lifetime PD and the lifetime losses associated with that PD, adjusted for FLI. The Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in determining whether there has been a SICR since initial recognition based on qualitative, quantitative, and reasonable and supportable information that includes FLI. Detail on the Consolidated Entity's process to determine whether there has been a SICR is provided in Note 13 Expected credit losses.\n\nUse of alternative criteria could result in significant changes to the timing and amount of ECL to be recognised. Lifetime ECL is generally determined based upon the contractual maturity adjusted, where appropriate, for prepayments, extension, call and similar options, of the financial asset. For revolving facilities, the Consolidated Entity exercises judgement based on the behavioural, rather than contractual characteristics of the facility type. Stage II may include financial assets where the credit risk has improved and has been reclassified from stage III.\n\n## (iii) Stage III-Credit-impaired\n\nFinancial assets are classified as stage III where they are determined to be credit impaired, which generally matches the APRA definition of default. This includes exposures that are at least 90 days past due and where the obligor is unlikely to pay without recourse against available collateral.\n\nThe ECL for credit impaired financial assets is generally measured as the difference between the contractual and expected cash flows from the individual exposure, discounted using the EIR for that exposure. For credit-impaired exposures that are modelled collectively for portfolios of exposures, ECL is measured as the product of the lifetime PD, the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD), adjusted for FLI.",

The carrying amount of the asset is not adjusted as it is measured at fair value\n- \u00b7 loan assets, loans to related body corporate entities and subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 lease receivables, contract receivables and other assets measured at amortised cost - as a deduction to the gross carrying amount\n- \u00b7 undrawn credit commitments and financial guarantees (not measured at FVTPL) - as a provision included in other liabilities.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity concludes that there is no reasonable expectation of recovering cash flows from the financial asset, and all possible collateral has been realised, the financial asset is written off, either partially or in full, against the related provision. Recoveries of loans previously written off are recorded based on the cash received.\n\n## Impairment of interests in associates and joint ventures\n\nThe Consolidated Entity performs an assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that its interests in associates and joint ventures are impaired. The main indicators of impairment are significant changes in the market, economic or legal environment and a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost.\n\nIn making this judgement, the Consolidated Entity evaluates, among other factors, the normal volatility in share price and the period of time for which fair value has been below cost. If there is an indication that an investment in an associate or joint venture may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in the associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, with its carrying amount.\n\nImpairment losses recognised in the income statement for investments in associates and joint ventures are subsequently reversed through the income statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. The impairment losses (reversal of impairments) on investments in associates and joint ventures are recognised in the income statement as part of other impairment charges/reversal.\n\nFair value less costs to sell is estimated using market-based approaches using revenues, earnings and assets under management and multiples based on companies deemed comparable as well as other publicly available information relevant to the business.\n\nValue-in-use is calculated using pre-tax cashflow projections of operating revenue and expenses. Forecasts are extrapolated using a growth rate and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate incorporating market risk determinants, adjusted for specific risks related to the cash generating units, if any, and the environment in which it operates.\n\n## Impairment of investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries in the Company's financial statements are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment is recognised in other impairment charges/reversal, for the amount by which the investment's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. At each reporting date, investments in subsidiaries that have been impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment. The amount of any reversal of impairment recognised must not cause the investment's carrying value to exceed its original cost.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives (goodwill and certain intangible assets) are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nFor intangible assets that have a finite useful life and property, plant and equipment and ROU assets, an assessment is made at each reporting date for indications of impairment.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in other impairment charges as part of other operating income and charges for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.\n\nFor the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Intangible assets (other than goodwill) for which an impairment loss has been recognised are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. A reversal is recognised only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nIn relation to businesses acquired and held for disposal, the individual business is treated as a cash generating unit. Assets associated with strategic business acquisitions are allocated to each of the operating segments (refer to Note 3 Segment reporting ) and assessed for impairment.",

Information relating to these schemes is set out in Note 32 Employee equity participation.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity accounts for its share-based payments as follows:\n\nEquity settled awards: The awards are measured at their grant date fair value and based on the number of equity instruments expected to vest. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with a corresponding increase in equity with reference to the vesting period of those awards. Performance hurdles attached to Performance Share Units (PSUs) under the MEREP are not taken into account when determining the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date. Instead, these vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest. On vesting, the amount recognised in the share-based payments reserve is transferred to contributed equity. For the Company, the accounting is dependent on whether the Company is compensated for its obligations under the MEREP award. To the extent that employing subsidiaries compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees, a recharge liability due to subsidiaries is recognised by the Company at grant date representing the payment received in advance of the award being settled. This liability reduces over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. MEREP liabilities are recognised and disclosed in Note 30 Related party information. To the extent that employing subsidiaries do not compensate the Company for the MEREP offered to their employees', the Company reflects the provision of the equity settled award as a contribution to its subsidiary and as a result increases its investment in the subsidiary with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve. On vesting, amounts recognised in the share-based payments reserve are transferred to contributed equity.\n\nCash settled awards: The award liability is measured with reference to the number of awards and the fair value of those awards at each reporting date. Expenses are recognised as part of employment expenses with reference to the vesting period of those awards. Changes in the value of the liability are recognised in employment expenses.\n\n## Profit share remuneration\n\nThe Consolidated Entity recognises a liability and an expense for profit share remuneration to be paid in cash with reference to the performance period to which the profit share relates.\n\n## (xxiv) Leases\n\nAt the inception of a contract, the Consolidated Entity assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. At inception, or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Consolidated Entity allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component unless an election is made to account for the lease and non lease components as a single lease component.\n\n## (i) Accounting where the Consolidated Entity is the lessee\n\nThe Consolidated Entity leases corporate buildings, commodity storage facilities, technology and other equipment for which contracts are typically entered into for fixed periods of 12 months to 33 years and may include extension options. Leases are recognised as an ROU asset (as explained in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets ) and a corresponding liability at the commencement date, being the date the leased asset is available for use by the Consolidated Entity.\n\n## Lease liability\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (or if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate). Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest expense. Interest expense is, unless capitalised on a qualifying asset which is not measured at fair value, recognised as part of interest and similar expense over the lease period on the remaining lease liability balance for each period. Any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are also recognised as net operating lease income in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in lease term, an assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset, an index or rate, or a change in the estimated amount payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying value of the ROU asset, or, as net operating lease income, where the carrying value of the ROU asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n## Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Entity presents ROU assets in Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets (refer to Note 15) and lease liabilities in other liabilities (refer to Note 23) in the Statements of financial position.",

All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n## Finance lease\n\nWhere finance leases are granted to third parties, the present value of the minimum lease payments plus an estimate of the value of any unguaranteed residual value is recognised as a receivable and included in loan assets.\n\nThe difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is unearned interest income. Lease receipts are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. Interest income is recognised over the term of the lease using the EIR method, which reflects a constant rate of return. Finance lease income is presented within interest and similar income in the income statement.\n\n## Operating lease\n\nWhere the Consolidated Entity is the lessor under an operating lease, the underlying asset is carried at cost and depreciated over its useful life in accordance with the rates specified in Note 44(xiv) Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. Operating lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate. Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and right of-use assets.\n\nWhen the Consolidated Entity is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub lease separately. The lease classification of the sublease is determined with reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (xxv) Contributed equity\n\nOrdinary shares and other similar instruments are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are recorded in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the issue proceeds.\n\n## (xxvi) Fiduciary assets and client money\n\nThe Consolidated Entity engages in trust, fund or other fiduciary activities as well as certain brokerage and other trading-related activities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of third parties. Where such assets are controlled, and future economic benefits are expected to be realised by the Consolidated Entity, such assets and the income thereon are reflected in the Statements of financial position and income statement respectively. Where this is not the case, these assets and the income thereon are excluded from the Consolidated Entity's financial statements as they are not the assets of the Consolidated Entity. Fee income earned by the Consolidated Entity relating to its responsibilities from fiduciary and brokerage and other trading-related activities is included as part of fee and commission income.\n\n## (xxvii) Cash and bank balances\n\nCash and bank balances includes currency on hand, demand deposits and short-term balances with Central and other banks including unallocated precious metal balances. These balances are subsequently measured at amortised cost except unallocated precious metals which are held at FVTPL.\n\n## (xxviii) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash and bank balances (except unallocated precious metal balances) as well as certain liquid financial investments and non trading reverse repurchase agreements that have a contractual maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and are available to meet the Consolidated Entity's short-term cash commitments. Cash and cash equivalents exclude margin money balances, trading assets and certain client-related balances which are segregated from the Consolidated Entity's own funds and are thus restricted from use.\n\n## (xxix) Investment property\n\nInvestment properties are initially recognised at cost and subsequently stated at fair value at each reporting date. Any change in fair value, in addition to any lease income generated, is recognised in other income as part of other operating income and charges.\n\n## (xxx) Comparatives\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been re-presented to conform to changes in presentation in the current year.\n\n## (xxxi) Rounding of amounts\n\nIn accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 , amounts in the Directors' Report and Financial Report have been rounded off to the nearest million Australian dollars unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## (xxxii) New Australian Accounting Standards and amendments to Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that are not yet effective for the financial year\n\n## (i) AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts, amends the accounting for insurance contracts and will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts , AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts .

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Company and the Consolidated Entity in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our audit approach for the Consolidated Entity\n\nAn audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Consolidated Entity, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is structured into four operating groups and a corporate segment.

These component audit teams, in consultation with the group audit team, established an audit strategy tailored for each operating group and the corporate segment.\n- \u00b7 Our audit focused on where the Consolidated Entity made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events. To identify these subjective judgements, we considered the inherent risks facing the Consolidated Entity, including those arising from its respective business operations, and how the Consolidated Entity manages these risks. We also considered a number of other factors including the design and implementation of the Consolidated Entity's control environment relevant to the audit, the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial report and the risk of management override of controls.\n- \u00b7 Given the extent of the overseas operations of the Consolidated Entity, the component audit teams instructed a number of other member firms of the PwC global network to perform audit procedures. The group audit team determined the level of supervision and direction it needed to have over the audit work performed by the component audit teams, including over the component audit teams' review and supervision of the overseas audit teams they, in turn, instructed.\n- \u00b7 The work performed by the component audit teams and the overseas audit teams, together with additional audit procedures performed by the group audit team such as procedures over the Consolidated Entity's consolidation and the financial report disclosures, provided us with the information we needed for our opinion on the Consolidated Entity's financial report as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate only to the audit of the Consolidated Entity, unless otherwise noted. We communicated the key audit matters to the Board Audit Committee.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nProvision for expected credit losses on loan assets (Refer to Note 13)\n\nUnder the credit impairment model required by AASB 9: Financial Instruments (AASB 9), losses are recognised on an Expected Credit Loss (ECL) basis. ECLs are required to incorporate forward-looking information, reflecting the Consolidated Entity's view of potential future economic scenarios.\n\nThe global economic outlook remains uncertain given the current situation in Europe and the resulting market volatility, as well as the continued impact of COVID 19 on certain industries. As a result, significant judgement was required to be exercised by the Consolidated Entity in calculating the ECL. Specifically, this includes judgements around the determination and use of forward-looking information, including developing macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightings and the use of post model adjustments in the calculation of the ECL. In order to meet the ECL requirements of AASB 9, the Consolidated Entity has developed models that involve judgement including determining assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR). The ECL models of the Consolidated Entity rely on numerous data elements and certain post model adjustments are applied based on the Consolidated Entity's judgement.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved, we consider this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain controls supporting the Consolidated Entity's estimate of the ECL including controls relating to:\n\n- \u00b7 review, challenge and approval of certain forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings\n- \u00b7 monitoring the effectiveness of models used to support ECL estimates, and the validation and implementation of revised models\n- \u00b7 assessment of the credit quality of counterparties\n- \u00b7 review and challenge forums to assess the ECL output and post model adjustments.\n- \u00b7 accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL models, and\n\nIn addition to controls testing, we performed substantive procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing the appropriateness of conclusions reached by the Consolidated Entity from model monitoring performed on key models. This included assessing key model components such as SICR and reperformance of certain tests performed as part of the model monitoring\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, testing the appropriateness of a selection of changes to key models\n- \u00b7 together with PwC credit modelling experts, assessing whether the list of critical data elements identified by the Consolidated Entity was appropriate for key models\n- \u00b7 together with PwC economics experts, assessing the appropriateness of macroeconomic scenarios and certain forward-looking economic data developed by the Consolidated Entity\n- \u00b7 testing the completeness and accuracy of certain critical data elements used in key ECL models\n- \u00b7 assessing a selection of post model adjustments identified by the Consolidated Entity, including obtaining an understanding of the methodology used for overlay derivation and testing the underlying datasets used for the calculations\n- \u00b7 considering the impacts on the ECL of events occurring subsequent to balance date.\n\nFor credit impaired (stage III) loan provisions, we examined a sample of individual loan exposures to consider the appropriateness of provisions adopted.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",

If indicators of impairment, or reversal of impairment exist, the recoverable amount for each asset needs to be estimated. These assessments involve significant judgements such as estimating future cash flows and the rate at which they are discounted and in evaluating fair value less costs to sell.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved in light of the continued impact and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial significance of impairments and impairment reversals recognised, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe evaluated the Consolidated Entity's valuation methodologies used to estimate the recoverable amount of material interests in associates and joint ventures and the process by which they were developed. For selected interests in associates and joint ventures, our procedures, assisted in some aspects by PwC Valuation experts, included:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Consolidated Entity's assessments of whether there were any indicators of impairment or whether impairment losses recognised in prior periods should be reversed\n- \u00b7 evaluating the appropriateness of the impairment assessment methodology and significant assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 comparing previous cashflow forecasts to actual results or comparing previous net asset values to underlying investment values to assess the ability of the Consolidated Entity to forecast accurately\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of discount rates used in valuations\n- \u00b7 assessing the competence, capability and objectivity of the external appraisers, where relevant\n- \u00b7 assessing certain underlying data used in determining the carrying value and recoverable amount, and\n- \u00b7 testing the mathematical accuracy of the Consolidated Entity's discounted cashflow models which were used to determine the recoverable amount of the asset.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 financial instruments) (Refer to Note 38)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity exercises judgement in valuing certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value where there are significant unobservable inputs for the valuation of these assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are known as Level 3 financial instruments.\n\nFor the Consolidated Entity, these Level 3 financial instruments predominantly consist of trading assets, financial investments, loan assets and derivative financial instruments. Judgement is required in determining the appropriate models and inputs to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved in valuing these Level 3 financial instruments, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included assessing the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain controls relating to the valuation of Level 3 financial instruments, including controls over:\n\n- \u00b7 approval and validation of the models adopted\n- \u00b7 the price verification process performed by the Consolidated Entity using prices and model inputs sourced from third parties\n- \u00b7 accuracy of inputs to models\n- \u00b7 calculation and approval of key valuation adjustments, and\n- \u00b7 governance, review and challenge forums.\n\nTogether with PwC valuation experts, we assessed the valuation of a sample of derivative financial instruments and trading assets, including level 3 instruments. We considered a sample of collateral disputes, gains and losses on disposals and other events to help assess the appropriateness of the valuations. We also evaluated the methodology and underlying assumptions used to determine valuation adjustments. We tested a sample of valuation adjustments as at the period-end.\n\nFor a sample of financial investments and loan assets, we assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies applied, as well as the appropriateness of the inputs used.\n\nWe performed tests of the allocation of financial instruments to the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Consolidated Entity's controls over IT systems include:\n\n- \u00b7 the framework of governance over IT systems\n- \u00b7 controls over access to programs, data and IT operations, and\n- \u00b7 controls over program development and changes\n- \u00b7 governance over generic and privileged user accounts.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter given the:\n\n- \u00b7 financial reporting processes of the Consolidated Entity are heavily reliant on IT systems,\n- \u00b7 underlying IT controls over business processes are significant to the financial reporting process, and\n- \u00b7 data migration activities which occurred during the year impacted the key IT processes, systems and controls relevant to the financial reporting process.\n\n## Valuation of tax payable and tax receivable relating to tax uncertainties (Refer to Note 11 and Note 23)\n\nThe Consolidated Entity is subject to taxation in a number of jurisdictions. The assessment of the amounts expected to be paid to and received from tax authorities is considered initially by the Consolidated Entity in each local territory and then reviewed centrally, with consideration given to particular tax positions in certain jurisdictions. In some cases, the treatment of tax positions requires judgement to estimate the ultimate amounts of tax that will be paid and received.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved, we consider this to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Income recognition (Refer to Note 2)\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required by the Consolidated Entity in relation to the timing of recognition and measurement of fee income, income from disposal of assets and performance fees. Further, the determination of performance fees recognition involves judgements relating to the timing and amount of variable consideration to be recognised.\n\nGiven the extent of judgement involved, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included evaluating the analysis conducted by the Consolidated Entity which sets out the basis for judgements made in respect of the ultimate amounts expected to be paid to and received from tax authorities.\n\nAssisted by PwC tax experts in the relevant jurisdictions, we read a risk focused selection of correspondence with tax authorities and external advice obtained by the Consolidated Entity and used our understanding of the business to assess the completeness and quantum of the provision for tax and tax receivable. We considered the likelihood of additional tax exposures occurring based on our knowledge of tax legislation, applicable precedent and industry developments, noting the level of judgement involved.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nOur audit procedures included evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of relevant controls relating to the recognition and measurement of fee income, income from disposal of assets and performance fees.\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the recognition of fee income and performance fees, we recalculated revenue for a sample of fees based on relevant information in supporting documents including contracts, fund constitutions and management agreements. Specifically for performance fees, we also considered the nature of the underlying fund assets, the proportion of assets already realised, the returns on the assets realised to date and the potential for volatility in the valuation of the remaining unrealised assets.\n\nWe performed testing over the timing of income recognition from the disposal of assets in respect of certain transactions where sale agreements were in place at year end but the transaction had not yet been fully completed to assess the appropriateness of the recognition of income from the disposal of assets.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the Consolidated Entity's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur procedures included evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain controls over the continued integrity of the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of system functionality that was key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWe considered the key risks of the system implementation and data migration activities applicable to the financial reporting process and tested a sample of relevant controls, as well as testing the completeness and accuracy of the data migration.\n\nWhere we identified design and operating effectiveness matters relating to IT systems or application controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative audit procedures. We also considered mitigating controls in order to respond to the impact on our overall audit approach.",

Given the quantum of the investment and the impairment reversal, and the judgement involved in determining the recoverable amount, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Company's assessment of whether there were any indicators of impairment or whether impairment losses recognised in prior periods should be reversed\n- \u00b7 evaluating the appropriateness of the impairment assessment methodology and significant assumptions applied in calculating the recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 comparing previous cashflow forecasts to actual results to assess the ability of the Company to forecast accurately\n- \u00b7 together with PwC valuation experts, assessing the appropriateness of key inputs in determining the recoverable amount including applicable valuation multiples\n- \u00b7 assessing certain underlying data used in determining the carrying value and recoverable amount, and\n- \u00b7 testing the mathematical accuracy of the Company's valuation model which was used to determine the recoverable amount of the subsidiary.\n\nWe assessed the reasonableness of the Company's disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2022, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company and the Consolidated Entity to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Company or the Consolidated Entity or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/ content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf.

The financial reporting periods may hence not be fully comparable with one another as a result of changes in accounting standards' requirements.\n\n| Financial years ended 31 March                                                    | 2022         | 2021    | 2020     | 2019    | 2018       | 2017      | 2016      | 2015    | 2014    | 2013    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income statement ($ million)                                                      |              |         |          |         |            |           |           |         |         |         |\n| Net operating income                                                              | 17,324       | 12,774  | 12,325   | 12,754  | 10,920     | 10,364    | 10,158    | 9,262   | 8,132   | 6,657   |\n| Total operating expenses                                                          | (10,785)     | (8,867) | (8,871)  | (8,887) | (7,456)    | (7,260)   | (7,143)   | (6,740) | (6,026) | (5,252) |\n| Operating profit before income tax                                                | 6,539        | 3,907   | 3,454    | 3,867   | 3,464      | 3,104     | 3,015     | 2,522   | 2,106   | 1,405   |\n| Income tax expense                                                                | (1,586)      | (899)   | (728)    | (879)   | (883)      | (868)     | (927)     | (899)   | (827)   | (533)   |\n| Profit after income tax                                                           | 4,953        | 3,008   | 2,726    | 2,988   | 2,581      | 2,236     | 2,088     | 1,623   | 1,279   | 872     |\n| Macquarie income securities  distributions                                        | -
