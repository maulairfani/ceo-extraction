The Group leverages its real estate management platform to enhance returns through property development and funds management.\n\nListed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) since 1971, today The GPT Group is a constituent of the S&P/ASX 50 Index with a substantial investor base of more than 32,000 securityholders.\n\n## Our vision\n\n## Our purpose\n\nTo be the most respected property company in Australia in the eyes of our investors, people, customers and communities.\n\nTo create value for investors by providing high quality real estate spaces that enable people to excel and our customers and communities to prosper in a sustainable way.\n\n## Our values\n\nEach day, our core values guide our employees as they work to deliver on our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety First Everyone, Always\n\nWe care about people above everything else.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Raise the Bar\n\nWe think big, take initiative, share ideas and challenge the status quo.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Deliver Today, Create Tomorrow\n\nWe focus on the present and the future to deliver consistent, dependable performance.\n\n## Value Differences, Play as a Team\n\nWe embrace our diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, working together for the best outcome.\n\n## A proud history and an exciting future\n\nAs Australia's first real estate investment trust (A-REIT), units in The General Property Trust first traded on the Sydney Stock Exchanges on 28 April, 1971. The Trust's 6 million units were held by approximately 2,300 unitholders and provided everyday 'mum and dad' investors with the opportunity to invest in commercial property and share in its consistent returns.\n\nThe portfolio was valued at $6.1 million at 30 June 1971 and consisted of Penrith Plaza shopping centre (still 50 per cent owned by GPT today and now named Westfield Penrith) and residential apartments in the Sydney suburbs of Gladesville and Homebush.\n\nWhile the diversity and composition of our property portfolio has changed over the years, the foundations have remained the same - to deliver growing and predictable returns for investors of all sizes and to do so in a way that creates value for all stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Speak Up\n\nWe are courageous and speak up about things that matter.",

        "page_content": "## Letter to Securityholders\n\n## 2021 Annual Result\n\n2021 was another year punctuated by the impacts of the global pandemic and the measures implemented to protect the health and safety of the community. Its effects have been far reaching, taking a toll on our people, our customers and the community. The resilience and commitment of our teams to support our customers and communities has been remarkable and is to be commended. Despite the Omicron variant of COVID-19 now causing further disruption, the successful implementation of the national vaccination program provides a level of optimism that there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThe Group delivered Funds From Operations (FFO) of $554.5 million for the 12 months ended 31 December 2021, in line with the prior year. FFO per security increased 1.2 per cent to 28.82 cents, reflecting the reduction in securities due to the on-market buy back. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group bought back 32.3 million securities (1.7 per cent of securities issued) for a total consideration of $146.8 million, an average price of $4.54 per security.\n\nOur Statutory Net Profit After Tax was $1,422.8 million compared to a loss of $213.2 million in the prior year, predominantly due to favourable investment property valuation movements of $924.3 million. The Group's Total Return for the year increased to 14.1 per cent due to investment property valuation gains driving an increase in Net Tangible Assets per security by 9.3 per cent to $6.09. A second half 2021 distribution of 9.9 cents was declared on 14 February 2022, resulting in a full year distribution of 23.2 cents per security. This is an increase of 3.1 per cent compared to the prior year.\n\nPrudent capital management remained a focus for the Group during the year while continuing to deliver on our strategic objectives, with strong credit ratings of 'A negative' and 'A2 stable' by S&P and Moody's respectively. Gearing increased to 28.2 per cent, up 5 percentage points on the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of the Ascot Capital logistics portfolio in November.\n\n## Executing on our strategy to create long term value\n\nOwning and managing a diversified portfolio of high quality real estate in Australia's largest cities is core to our strategy and provides us with the opportunity to benefit from sectors with favourable trends while reshaping our exposure to others. Productive relationships with our customers are central to our success, and we remain committed to ensuring that we have a customer-centric approach across the business. Customer engagement provides rich insights into the space, services, and experiences our customers desire, and positions us to exceed their evolving expectations. This engagement informs our development projects, further investment in our assets, and investments in technology and sustainability which are of ever-growing importance to our customers.\n\nConsistent with our strategy, we increased our investment in the Logistics sector through both acquisitions and developments during the year. At year end, our Logistics assets represented approximately 27 per cent of the Group's diversified real estate portfolio. The Logistics sector continues to benefit from strong structural tailwinds and investor demand. Revaluation gains from the Logistics portfolio were approximately $555 million. With a $1.6 billion development pipeline, we remain on track to grow Logistics to be approximately 30 per cent of the Group's investment portfolio.\n\nOffice occupancy for our $6.1 billion portfolio was 92.9 per cent at 31 December 2021. This includes 32 Smith and the GPT Wholesale Office Fund's (GWOF) Queen & Collins developments completed in the year, which, including Heads of Agreement, are 81.7 per cent and 50.2 per cent committed respectively. In December, we commenced GWOF's 28,300 square metre development at 51 Flinders Lane.\n\nRetail portfolio occupancy was 99.1 per cent at 31 December 2021. There was significant leasing activity during the year, with 561 deals completed and an improvement in all key leasing metrics compared to December 2020. In February 2022, GPT and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (GWSCF) announced the sale of Casuarina Square shopping centre in Darwin for a net sale price of $397 million. This asset was considered\n\nnon-core for GPT, and we expect to redeploy the capital into new opportunities that will generate long-term value for investors.\n\nOur Funds Management platform has expanded through the creation of the GPT QuadReal Logistics Trust with global real estate firm QuadReal. GPT has a 50.1 per cent interest in the venture and provides acquisition, development and investment management services. Approximately 70 per cent of the $1 billion target has been committed to secured projects.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nExcellence in environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters underpins our activities and the business's future performance. Leadership in ESG was elevated to a strategic priority following our regular review of the Group's strategy in 2021.\n\nSafety is a core value for the Group. All GPT employees play a part in ensuring that our colleagues, stakeholders and visitors to GPT's workplaces or assets go home safely. We instil a 'Safety First' culture across all of our activities, including ensuring that all new employees participate in our safety leadership program as part of their induction process.\n\nAn ongoing focus on employee wellbeing has also been of paramount importance given the sustained impact of the pandemic. To support their wellbeing during restrictions, we centred our efforts on providing opportunities for our people to come together to continue building a sense of community and culture and on providing support with a focus on their mental health and family life. This included bespoke wellbeing programs and education sessions, and creating opportunities to engage with their colleagues. Regular communication through virtual Town Hall meetings and individual team meetings has also been effective in keeping people feeling connected and supported.\n\nGlobal action to address climate change accelerated in 2021. GPT has been proactive in relation to ensuring the resilience of its portfolio and minimising its impact on the environment. We have established a target for our managed assets to be certified as operating on a carbon neutral basis by 2024. We remain on track to achieve this target with our asset teams progressively working through the certification of our Office assets",

We will have further assets certified as operating carbon neutral in 2022, including two Retail shopping centres.\n\nAligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have released our third Climate Disclosure Statement. This Statement outlines our progress and priorities in addressing climate-related risk, and demonstrates our consideration of this risk as part of our investment, development, and asset management activities.\n\nThe importance of respecting human rights, including the rights of First Nations people, and the related need for meaningful action to identify and eliminate modern slavery continues to shape our social and community engagement. GPT respects and upholds human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and continues to enhance transparency in this area. The Group's second Modern Slavery Statement was released in December and describes our progress and our future plans to address this complex global challenge.\n\nWe completed our Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) during the year and will continue to contribute to reconciliation through our next RAP which will be released in 2022. We are partnering with First Nations stakeholders to inform our developments and to support opportunities for our people, customers and communities to explore the ancient cultures and traditions of Australia's First Nations people through our commitments and activities.\n\nAn inclusive, empowered corporate culture and work environment drives the Group's success. We continued our progress towards our diversity, inclusion and equity targets during 2021, retaining our status as an Employer of Choice for Gender Equality, a Bronze Employer for LGBTQ+ Inclusion, and seeking certification as a Family Inclusive Workplace. Our CEO and Managing Director, Bob Johnston, continues his active membership of the Property Champions of Change Coalition to improve inclusion and reduce gender bias across the property sector and corporate Australia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leadership Team changes\n\nIn January 2022, we announced changes to the Group's Leadership Team and organisational structure to reflect the growth in our Logistics portfolio, provide greater sector alignment and enhance operational efficiencies. These changes also reflect the changing dynamics of the markets and our business.\n\nMartin Ritchie has been appointed as the Head of Office and brings deep experience in the sector, having been the GWOF Fund Manager since the inception of the Fund in 2006. Martin will retain oversight of GWOF. Chris Davis, who has been instrumental in growing the Logistics portfolio over the last six years, has been appointed as Head of Logistics and will also oversee the expansion of the QuadReal partnership. Chris Barnett's role as Head of Retail and Mixed-Use has been expanded to include oversight of GWSCF. As a result of these changes long standing members of the Leadership Team, Mathew Faddy and Nicholas Harris, have departed GPT.\n\nJames Coyne, the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary will also be departing the Group in April 2022 and will be replaced by Marissa Bendyk, who is currently the General Counsel, Corporate and Governance & Group Company Secretary for AMP Limited.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nGood corporate governance is a central part of GPT's commitment to our securityholders. The Board strives to ensure that GPT meets high governance standards across our operations.\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that it collectively has a mix of skills, experience, expertise, diversity and tenure to enable it to discharge its responsibilities. We are confident that the Board has the suitable composition to guide the Group and support management in their execution of the Group's strategy. The Board maintained its meeting program during the year, with technology continuing to facilitate director participation when restrictions were in place.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIt has been a busy year for the Group as we continued to navigate the challenges of the global pandemic as well as position the business for opportunities. Our Office and Logistics assets continued to deliver strong results, and when restrictions eased our\n\nRetail assets benefited from a solid recovery in customer visitation and sales which is testament to the quality of our assets and the strength of the relationships we have with our customers.\n\nThe pandemic is still with us, but we are optimistic that the high levels of vaccinations across the Australian community will mean that there will be less disruption in the year ahead. The reactivation of the CBDs of Melbourne and Sydney will be important for the Group's performance in 2022 in terms of office leasing and the recovery of Melbourne Central. Melbourne Central was one of GPT's strongest performing retail assets prior to the pandemic and is yet to benefit from a return of office workers, students, and tourists to the heart of Melbourne. We believe CBDs will continue to play an important role for businesses and the broader economy in a post pandemic world, and our high quality assets will benefit from their prime locations, access to public transport and amenity.\n\nOur focus on ESG over many years also positions us well for the future and we will continue to raise the bar to deliver outcomes that are in the long-term interests of our securityholders and the community.\n\nWe would like to thank our Board colleagues for their leadership and support in what has been a challenging period and on behalf of the Board and management, we thank our employees for their continued commitment, resilience, and hard work despite the year's uncertainty.\n\nTo conclude, we thank our investors for their support of GPT. We look forward to building on the successes of 2021 to continue to deliver long-term value for securityholders.\n\nVickki McFadden CHAIRMAN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bob Johnston\n\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND MANAGING DIRECTOR",

Portfolio growth in the logistics sector has been a core focus since 2017, and the Group again made strong progress by securing development and investment opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.\n\nThe Logistics portfolio increased to $4.4 billion during the year, with strong portfolio occupancy of 98.8 per cent and a Weighted Average Lease Expiry (WALE) of 6.5 years.\n\nAcquisitions have contributed to the portfolio's growth, including the Group's $597 million acquisition of a portfolio of 23 Logistics assets. The acquisition extends our portfolio into new geographies while adding to our scale along the eastern seaboard.\n\nGrowth has also been achieved through the activation and development of the Group's substantial landbank. Four developments were completed during the year, adding 87,300 square metres to the portfolio. New facilities were completed in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane with a further four development projects underway or due to commence in the first quarter that are expected to be delivered in 2022.\n\n1.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020.\n\nOur capital partnership with QuadReal has also grown, with approximately 70 per cent of the increased $1 billion target for the GPT QuadReal Logistics Trust now committed across acquisitions and future development projects.\n\nOur expanded development pipeline, across the Group and the GPT QuadReal Logistics Trust has an estimated end value of approximately $1.6 billion upon completion. Located in core industrial precincts across the eastern seaboard, the pipeline has the capacity to deliver approximately 715,000 square metres of high quality space.\n\nWe continue to execute on the Group's strategy to expand and optimise our portfolio, capitalising on development opportunities within our existing landbank and assessing acquisitions to further grow our significant Australian logistics portfolio and create value for securityholders.",

Mixed-use development opportunities at Rouse Hill Town Centre and Highpoint Shopping Centre demonstrate how our business activities combine to unlock value for our stakeholders, capitalising on the increasing desire to live in convenient and connected communities close to transport, retail and community facilities.\n\nOriginally developed by GPT in 2008, Rouse Hill Town Centre is well positioned to capitalise on the continued growth of north-west Sydney. Our popular and productive 70,000 square metre regional shopping centre has delivered a 8.5 per cent total return for the last 12 months and maintained 100 per cent occupancy. The centre is a community hub by design, combining the principles and feel of a traditional market town centre with the latest shopping, dining and lifestyle choices right next to a Metro train station.\n\nOur proposed mixed-use development at Rouse Hill will offer the opportunity to live in the heart of this vibrant community setting. The project will deliver 10,500 square metres of incremental retail space, with approximately 220 residential apartments joining those already integrated into the existing Rouse Hill Town Centre. Planning approvals are progressing and we plan to commence the development in late 2022.\n\nSimilarly, the proposed mixed-use development at Highpoint Shopping Centre will cement the centre's position as the leading retail centre in the growing western Melbourne region over the long term. Plans were approved in December 2021 for a substantial mixed-use development on the centre's significant 28 hectare site. The proposed 30-year master plan allows for the creation of an additional 148,000 square metres of commercial space, 10,000 square metres of community space, and 3,000 residential dwellings, with Highpoint becoming home to approximately 6,000 residents and more than 9,000 daily workers. A new town square, community facilities and additional green space would add to Highpoint's transformation into a modern urban village.\n\nMixed-use opportunities such as the Rouse Hill and Highpoint developments provide significant scope to add value to the portfolio over the longer term while continuing to own and manage high performing assets.",

GWOF has assets of $9.8 billion including an ownership interest in 17 Australian office assets, and achieved Carbon Neutral Certification of 100 per cent of its operating portfolio in 2020.\n\nThe GWOF Green Bond received strong support from a broad investor base across Australia and Asia, including a number of new investors who were attracted to its green nature and GWOF's sustainability credentials. This strong interest resulted in the bond being increased from its initial $200 million target.\n\nThe GWOF Green Bond has been certified by the globally recognised Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI) in line with leading market standards. Proceeds from the Green Bond will be used to refinance existing GWOF assets that meet CBI's Low Carbon Buildings Criteria, which require the assets to perform in the top 15 per cent in their relative city in terms of carbon intensity.\n\nLiberty Place, Sydney\n\nPrior to launching the Green Bond, GPT established its Sustainable Debt Framework which outlines how GPT and its managed funds (including GWOF) intend to issue and manage sustainable debt.

The $272 million redevelopment of Queen & Collins for the GPT Wholesale Office Fund (GWOF) incorporates forward thinking design that illustrates how workplaces are evolving to embrace flexibility and collaboration.\n\nComprising 33,600 square metres of A-Grade office space, the development reimagined ANZ's former 34-storey global headquarters, located in the heart of Melbourne's CBD. The distinctive buildings offer workspaces ranging from 900 square metre floors in the office tower to more intimate spaces within refurbished heritage buildings 380 Collins Street and the Safe Deposit Building at 90 Queen Street. The buildings connect cohesively through Venetianinspired campiello spaces that are home to retail, commercial and public facilities. The distinctive space hosted the Melbourne Fashion Week closing runway in November 2021.\n\nThe innovative workplace solutions featured at Queen & Collins support hybrid ways of working, which have become increasingly popular. Our adaptive approach offers tenants more spaces for the collaboration and social connection that employees are seeking when they come to the workplace. GPT and BVN Architecture have developed a new workplace model, The Clubhouse, that provides greater flexibility in the office environment, with equal weight given to zones for collaboration and team work, quiet desk work, meetings and calls, informal conversations and gatherings. Operable walls and multi-purpose spaces allow businesses and their employees to configure their workspace to suit the task at hand, and are flexible enough to look different every day of the week.\n\n42 Cox Place\\_Glendenning\n\nThe Clubhouse offers tenants the opportunity to adopt and tailor this workplace model to their particular needs. Several tenants are already working in Clubhouse workplaces within Queen & Collins, with more being developed. ELMO Software adopted a two-floor Clubhouse model for their new Melbourne headquarters, which they occupied in October 2021.\n\nTo further enhance the idea of flexible space for our tenants, Queen & Collins also offers The Mezzanine, a collection of serviced spaces such as boardrooms, meeting rooms, and a 'third space' connected to the lobby atria for large gatherings, events and celebrations. The Mezzanine supplements tenants' own workspaces with bookable additional facilities and project rooms when needed. The Mezzanine is complemented by the cafe and the exciting addition of a restaurant to be delivered by the NOMAD Group in the striking gothic Cathedral Room.\n\nQueen & Collins was completed in June 2021 and was awarded a 6 Star Green Star - Design rating from the Green Building Council of Australia. The precinct operates with 100 per cent renewable electricity.\n\nLeasing is 50.2 per cent progressed including Heads of Agreement, with tenants such as technology firms Afterpay and ELMO Software, global recruitment consultancy Robert Walters, and engineering consulting business Arcadis calling Queen & Collins home.\n\n## Value created\n\n- \u00bb Growing and predictable earnings\n- \u00bb Thriving places\n- \u00bb Sustainable environment\n- \u00bb Prospering customers, suppliers and communities",

We foster an inclusive and high performing work environment that provides our people with flexibility and development opportunities. An Employee Engagement Survey was completed in June 2021 using a new platform that utilises global benchmarking data. Overall employee engagement was 66 per cent. The survey showed that 85 per cent of employees are proud to work at GPT and 86 per cent believe we are a great place to work. Our commitment to community engagement and social sustainability, inclusive work environment, and strong and effective crossteam collaboration were also highly rated by our people. To improve our engagement score, our people have told us they would like greater celebration of our achievements, and enhanced communication about our progress against strategy and the contributions that our people make. These areas are the focus of our people strategy and activities for the coming year.\n\nOur people are empowered when everyone feels represented, so we seek to be a diverse and inclusive workplace that offers opportunities for learning, development and growth to everyone. We launched the 2021 GPT First Nations Scholarship at Western Sydney University in September, offering paid work for a First Nations student from a broad range of study areas. We retained our Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation and our Bronze status as an LGBTQ+ inclusive employer.\n\nOur work environment strongly supports the wellbeing of our people, so we encourage our employees to develop lifelong healthy habits to support their wellbeing and productivity beyond their time at work. This has been a particularly critical year to do so, given the challenges that the pandemic brought to the wellbeing of our employees and their families.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging with stakeholders\n\nGPT has a consultative work environment where employee views are sought out, respected, and acted upon where appropriate. Typically, GPT conducts an employee engagement survey every 18 to 24 months and pulse surveys on focused topics during the intervening period. We also engage with our employees on various matters to shape our employee offerings and opportunities.\n\nOver 2021 there has been a continued focus on GPT's culture especially in relation to employee wellbeing, behaviour, and psychological safety giving consideration to the outcomes of the Respect@Work: Sexual Harassment National Inquiry Report. This involved the Board and all our employees receiving sexual harassment and bullying training, and a review of policy and processes including consequence management. The Human Resources & Remuneration Committee retains oversight of all incidences and our response to any sexual harassment or bullying matters.\n\nGPT's participation in external assessments such as the Workplace Gender Equality Agency's Employer of Choice for Gender Equality citation and the Australian Workplace Equality Index for LGBTQ+ inclusion, help us to measure our progress and identify further actions we can take to ensure our work environment remains inclusive and engaging.\n\n## Related risks and opportunities\n\n- \u00bb People and culture\n- \u00bb Health and safety, and\n- \u00bb Portfolio operating and financial performance.",

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted mental health and wellbeing across the community during 2020 and this continued in 2021.\n\nSeeking to capitalise on the opportunities presented by enforced periods of 'working from home' in 2020, we consulted with our people to review our Flexible Work Policy during April and May 2021. Focus groups were held with a representative 20 per cent of our workforce to understand their experiences of flexible work and discuss the strengths and opportunities of the Group's existing policy. This consultation reinforced the desire for a flexible work approach that was itself flexible to accommodate each person's individual circumstances, preferences, and job role. Our refreshed Flexible Work Policy was launched in May and commits GPT to a Group-wide hybrid work model that enables our people to work in the office and remotely as best suits their role and circumstances, in agreement with their manager.\n\nAs the pandemic continued during the year, our people again demonstrated their resilience and adaptability as we adjusted work arrangements and daily routines in response to government restrictions. For many, the mental health impacts were more keenly felt during 2021, when 'lockdown' routines quickly returned and fatigue set in.\n\nTo support their wellbeing during restrictions, we focused our efforts on providing opportunities for our people to come together, to reflect on their mental health, to contribute to something beyond their work, and to have fun with their colleagues.\n\nA range of virtual activities encouraged our teams to stay connected. They included physical activities including yoga, qi gong, meditation, and dance classes, and teambuilding events such as trivia, bingo, and pet competitions. Cooking classes and magic shows brought the young and young-at-heart together. These events were supplemented by regular updates on available virtual lockdown activities\n\nfor people seeking entertainment, cultural experiences such as virtual art exhibitions, and ideas to entertain children during remote schooling.\n\nTo encourage our people to reflect on their mental health, we hosted regular webinars throughout 2021 on topics such as combating fatigue, and balancing work and remote learning. We marked R U OK day with Cuppa for Life founder Luke Cook for a candid conversation about his strategies to maintain wellbeing, and the importance of genuine interactions and connections. Attended by almost half of our workforce, Luke's insights encouraged our people to participate for the first time in Mental Health Month during October. An annual initiative of the Mental Health Foundation Australia, GPT used Mental Health Month to offer our people access to the Cuppa for Life program of lunchtime masterclasses and regular wellbeing conversations.\n\nContributing to something beyond their work, several GPT teams took up community fundraising activities during the year. Members of our Brisbane team tackled the River to Rooftop stair climb hosted by One One One Eagle Street, which raised more than $114,000 for domestic violence services provided by Women's Legal Service Queensland. The 105-person strong GPT Steptember team logged more than 39 million steps to raise almost $34,000 for the Cerebral Palsy Alliance. During Mental Health Month, our Melbourne Central team supported ReachOut's 'Make a Move' campaign and raised more than $10,000 to prevent youth suicide.\n\nThrough our restated commitment to flexible work and our wellbeing-focused response to enforced periods of remote work, GPT continued to support and enhance employee mental health and wellbeing.\n\n## Value created\n\n- \u00bb Empowered people\n\n<!-- image -->",

Development activities can affect biodiversity.\n\nGPT minimises our impact on the environment across our operations and aims to ensure the future resilience of our properties to foreseeable environmental changes. Comprehensive operations management systems and processes, including our ISO14001 Certified Environmental Management System, enable us to monitor and measure performance and set targets to improve building efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Developments are designed so that they can be constructed and operated with reduced environmental impact and operated efficiently upon completion.\n\nThe Group reduced its emissions intensity by 82 per cent and energy intensity by 55 per cent respectively against our 2005 baseline. We maintained the Climate Active Certification of the GWOF portfolio, and continued to make progress on our Carbon Neutral 2024 target with a further two office assets certified during 2021. Four assets commenced operating on a carbon neutral basis during the year, including our first two retail assets.

They also assist us to identify and understand the changing stakeholder expectations in relation to ESG, how our performance aligns with those expectations, and how it compares to our global real estate peers.\n\nOur understanding of sustainable property operations, environmental issues, and stakeholder expectations influences how we create value through our sustainable operations and informs our assessment of the material risks and opportunities arising from our environmental impact.\n\n## Related risks and opportunities\n\n- \u00bb Portfolio operating and financial performance\n- \u00bb Development, and\n- \u00bb Environmental and social sustainability.\n\nWe are committed to being a positive contributor to the environment across our property operations and development activities, informed by our restorative approach to addressing the residual environmental impacts of our direct activities. This approach creates value by restoring the environment while ensuring our buildings remain resilient as the environment changes to deliver shared benefits for our investors, local communities and stakeholders.\n\nHOW WE CREATE VALUE",

Currently being developed for the GPT Wholesale Office Fund (GWOF), 51 Flinders Lane comprises two office towers with 28,300 square metres of premium boutique work environments and a 1,200 square metre retail laneway precinct linking Flinders Street to Flinders Lane in Melbourne's iconic east-end. On completion the development is expected to have an end value of approximately $535 million.\n\n51 Flinders Lane has impressive sustainable design credentials and is targeting a 6 Star Green Star Design and As-Built rating from the Green Building Council of Australia, a WELL Platinum Rating for tenant health and wellbeing, a 6 Star NABERS Energy Rating (with GreenPower), and Climate Active for Buildings Carbon Neutral Certification when completed.\n\nThe development has also focused on reducing the building's embodied carbon, or the total carbon emissions generated from materials and during construction. These emissions are incurred during development from the production of construction materials, such as concrete and steel, and from the construction process itself. Embodied carbon can only be reduced or eliminated during the design and construction phase; it cannot be reduced once the building is complete and would instead need to be offset to reduce its impact.\n\nFor 51 Flinders Lane, we undertook a carbon mapping and lifecycle analysis as part of the building's design to measure the emissions of its material elements. We then set a goal to reduce the building's total embodied carbon by 40 per cent. 6 With this goal in mind, we worked with our partners to achieve it and\n\nused the analysis to inform design decisions. During the structural design review, for example, we re-engineered the building structure to reduce a significant proportion of embodied carbon, eliminating more than 3,600 cubic metres of concrete and 184,000 kilograms of accompanying reinforcement steel.\n\n51 Flinders Lane is also targeting to recycle a minimum 90 per cent of its construction waste and has specified the use of environmentally certified products, such as timber, paint and carpet, procured locally where possible, as well as the use of use recycled materials in tenant fit outs.\n\nWe are collaborating with our construction partner Probuild to enhance construction efficiencies to further reduce embodied carbon, and to explore the feasibility of low carbon materials and carbon neutral site operations. Construction commenced in December with completion expected in early 2025.\n\nAs with all GPT development projects, we will continue to learn from each project as we continue to create the leading office assets in their markets, with timeless design, quality amenities and superior sustainability outcomes.\n\nFind out more about our approach to reducing embodied carbon in GPT's Climate Disclosure Statement, available on our website: www.gpt.com.au\n\n## Value created\n\n- \u00bb Growing and predictable earnings\n- \u00bb Thriving places\n- \u00bb Sustainable environment\n- 6 Measured as a 40% reduction in Global Warming Potential, an internationally recognised embodied carbon metric.",

At 32 Smith, we collaborated with the Darug community to understand the history and significance of the nearby Parramatta River. Through this partnership, design features were developed to share Darug stories of Country and culture as visitors move through the precinct. Reflecting important Darug songlines, the intricate 14 metre long etched lobby artwork shows how the Darug people used the river, while Darug totems and language feature on seating and paving across 32 Smith's outdoor room.\n\nPartnering with the DCAC also informed the initial planning of our Kemps Creek logistics estate development. Together we explored the opportunity to identify a First Nations name for the estate as a means of respectfully recognising Darug culture, reintroducing Darug language into everyday vocabulary, and to highlight the estate in this growing industrial precinct. The agreed name - Yiribana - means 'this way' in Darug language and holds a practical and symbolic meaning that reflects the movement of goods towards their destination. The estate's logo was then developed by Aboriginal-owned design agency Balarinji and Darug artist Leanne Mulgo Watson.\n\nIn Melbourne, a ceremonial fire dish developed by First Nations architect Jefa Greenaway in consultation with Traditional Custodians of Melbourne sits prominently in the southern campiello within the Queen & Collins redevelopment. The dish's design reflects the places of\n\nsignificance and local topography, acknowledging this heritage and the continued connection to Country.\n\nFirst Nations consultation has also informed the design approach for the proposed Cockle Bay Park development in the Sydney CBD. Engagement with the Sydney Aboriginal Community was led by Balarinji during concept development and precinct design, and this has informed how First Nations culture and the concept of Country can be embedded into the proposed development. Water elements throughout the precinct will reflect the cultural significance of the area's waterways to the Gadigal and Wangul people, and culture will also inform landscaping and open space design. 7\n\nGPT's commitment to our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) and our workforce's strong support for reconciliation have led to meaningful collaborations with Traditional Custodians during the initial development design stage to respectfully reflect and share each place's history and culture. We have completed our Stretch RAP 2018-2021 and will prepare our next Stretch RAP in consultation with Reconciliation Australia in 2022.\n\nWe continue to learn and build strong partnerships with First Nations communities, businesses and organisations at an asset level and in our corporate activities to contribute meaningfully to reconciliation through our partners, people, places and procurement.\n\n## Value created\n\n- \u00bb Thriving places\n- \u00bb Prospering customers, suppliers, and communities",

        "page_content": "## Group Performance\n\n## Review of Operations and Operating Result\n\nThe Group commenced 2021 with solid momentum and expected to deliver an increase in Funds From Operations. Our interim results demonstrated that we were on track to deliver on these expectations however momentum was disrupted at the end of the second quarter when governments commenced instituting various measures to prevent the spread of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the community. This culminated in restrictive lockdown measures that extended into the fourth quarter of 2021. The measures implemented by the New South Wales and Victorian governments also included the reintroduction of the Commercial Tenancy Code of Conduct requiring landlords to provide relief to eligible tenants in the form of rent waivers and rent payment deferral. The impact was mainly felt across our Retail assets where only essential stores were able to continue trading. Leasing activity in the Office sector also slowed as customers delayed leasing decisions while most office staff were working from home. Pleasingly, our Logistics portfolio remained resilient throughout the period. When restrictions eased, we saw a strong recovery in Retail rent collection and leasing activity across the Retail and Office portfolios.\n\nDespite the lockdown measures; we continued to make good progress on implementing our strategy to increase our weighting to the Logistics sector, successfully completing several acquisitions and developments. Logistics now represents approximately 27 per cent of the Group's diversified property portfolio.\n\nOffice developments at 32 Smith and the GPT Wholesale Office Fund's Queen & Collins were completed during the year and the Fund's development at 51 Flinders Lane commenced in December. We progressed masterplans for mixed-use development schemes at Highpoint Shopping Centre and the Rouse Hill Town Centre. Post the period, we also announced the sale of a non-core retail asset Casuarina Square owned jointly by GPT and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund.\n\nThe Group's gearing at the end of 2021 of 28.2 per cent remains below the mid-point of our target range of between 25 - 35 per cent, and our balance sheet liquidity position remains strong providing additional capacity for growth.\n\n## Funds from Operations (FFO)\n\nFunds from Operations (FFO) represents GPT's underlying earnings from its operations. This is determined by adjusting statutory net profit after tax under Australian Accounting Standards for certain items which are non-cash, unrealised or capital in nature. FFO includes impairment losses related to uncollected trade receivables.\n\nGPT delivered FFO of $554.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2021, broadly in line with the prior period. FFO per security increased 1.2 per cent to 28.82 cents, reflecting the reduction in securities due to the on-market buyback. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group bought back 32.3 million securities (1.7 per cent of securities issued) for a total consideration of $146.8 million, being an average price of $4.54 per security.\n\nEach segment's operational financial performance is detailed from page 28. The Group FFO result includes corporate management expenses of $62.5 million (2020: $26.1 million) which are unallocated to the segments. Total management expenses including the segments is $102.0 million (2020: $68.2 million). The increase in expenses is due to the prior year withdrawal of remuneration schemes and the receipt of JobKeeper assistance, plus an increase in IT costs and Directors and Officers insurance premiums this period.\n\nFinance costs from borrowings decreased to $85.5 million (2020: $103.8 million). This was predominantly as a result of a 70bp reduction in the cost of debt.\n\nGPT's statutory net profit after tax was $1,422.8 million, as compared to a loss of $213.2 million in the prior comparable period, predominantly due to positive investment property valuation movements of $924.3 million (2020: negative revaluation of $712.5 million).\n\nThe Group's 12 month Total Return was 14.1% per cent (2020: negative 2.4 per cent) as a result of investment property revaluation gains predominantly driving the increase in NTA per stapled security of 52 cents to $6.09 for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe Group targets to distribute 95 to 105 per cent of free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less maintenance and leasing capex and inventory movements.\n\nDistributions payable to stapled securityholders relating to the year ended 31 December 2021 totalled $444.4 million (2020: $438.3 million) 1 , representing an annual distribution of 23.2 cents per ordinary stapled security, an increase of 3.1 per cent on 2020 (2020: 22.5 cents) as a result of higher cash collection rates. This includes 9.9 cents ($189.6 million) in respect of the second half of 2021, which was declared on 14 February 2022 and is expected to be paid on 28 February 2022. The payout ratio for the year ended 31 December 2021 is 95.1 per cent of free cash flow.\n\n## 2021 Group FFO earnings composition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Valuations were conducted by valuers with appropriate experience and expertise. Some of the independent valuations continue to contain material valuation uncertainty clauses given the impacts of COVID-19 and reduced levels of transactional evidence. The valuations can be relied upon at the date of valuation however, a higher level of valuation uncertainty than normal is assumed.\n- \u00bb The independent valuations contain judgements relating to the ongoing impact of COVID-19 in addition to a number of assumptions, estimates and judgements on the future performance of each property including market rents, growth rates, occupancy, capital expenditure and investment metrics. Total portfolio assets increased by 15.2 per cent in the year ended 31 December 2021 due to positive property valuation movements and net investment in acquisitions and developments.\n- \u00bb The Group's rolling 12 month Total Return was 14.1 per cent (2020: negative 2.4 per cent) as a result of an increase in NTA per stapled security of 52 cents to $6.09 for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n- \u00bb Total borrowings increased by $1,051.9 million, in addition to a reduction in cash of $311.0 million, to fund acquisitions, developments and the security buy-back.",

We are also providing a range of space offerings, including turn-key office suites, flexible space through our Space&Co. offering, and the introduction of a new space-on-demand concept at Queen & Collins. Management has engaged with qualifying tenants to provide rent relief, predominantly for retail tenants in Victoria and New South Wales, and has reduced net income by $5.2 million for processed and expected rent waivers and an estimate of loss for uncollected rent for 2021. Cash collection rates in 2021 remained high, and we continue to engage closely with impacted customers.\n\n## Development net income\n\nDevelopment net income decreased to $1.2 million as a result of lower fees, with two developments reaching completion in the first half of 2021.\n\nThe Group's development of 32 Smith in Parramatta was completed in January and is 81.7 per cent committed including heads of agreement 10 . The building has attracted a range of insurance, legal and government customers including QBE who have leased 13,600sqm of the 26,800sqm tower.\n\nGWOF's Queen & Collins redevelopment in Melbourne was completed in June and provides 33,600sqm of high quality, distinctive office space. The building is 50.2 per cent committed including heads of agreement, and customers include Afterpay and ELMO Software.\n\nBoth developments are 6 Star Green Star - Design rated, with 32 Smith recently achieving a 6 Star Green Star - As Built rating from the Green Building Council of Australia.\n\nIn December, GWOF commenced a development at 51 Flinders Lane in Melbourne. With completion expected in early 2025, the project will incorporate 28,300sqm of prime office space targeting boutique occupiers in the popular east end of the CBD. GWOF's pipeline in Parramatta also expanded, with contracts exchanged to acquire 81-83, 2/85 George Street together with 1 Barrack Lane, adjacent to it's existing development site at 87-91 George Street.

Comparable income growth for the portfolio was 1.4 per cent. Occupancy of 98.8 per cent was achieved, with increased occupancy during the second half at the Austrak Business Park, Somerton along with the inclusion of leased acquisitions and completions. The portfolio has a WALE of 6.5 years.\n\nThe Group continued to execute its Logistics growth strategy, with the portfolio now totalling $4.4 billion.\n\nThe Group acquired a portfolio for $596.7 million from Ascot Capital, made up of 23 Logistics assets located across Australia. In Melbourne, GPT also acquired 235-239 Boundary Road, Laverton North for $72.5 million.\n\nThree fund-through acquisitions exchanged in the period, at Tarneit and Keysborough in Melbourne and Bundamba in Brisbane.

In Sydney, a 17,200sqm facility was completed at 42 Cox Place, Glendenning, and has been leased to Total Tyres. At our Gateway Logistics Hub estate in Truganina, Melbourne two facilities were completed, with the 29,800sqm facility at 25 Niton Drive leased to The Hut Group, and the 24,000sqm facility at 2 Prosperity Street leased to Cameron Transport. In Brisbane, a 16,300sqm facility at 1 Wattlebird Court, Berrinba has been leased to Mainfreight and Nature's Best.\n\nThe GQLT's Metroplex Place development in Wacol, Brisbane is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 and a further three developments are being activated by the Group for 2022 completion. In Truganina, at the Gateway Logistics Hub, a 27,200sqm speculative facility is expected to commence in the first quarter, and nearby at our Foundation Estate, a 10,600sqm facility is under construction, with terms agreed with an incoming tenant. In Brisbane, at the Wembley Business Park, Berrinba, a 21,800sqm facility is due for completion in the second half.

The weighted average capitalisation rate remains relatively stable at 5.03 per cent (2020: 5.06 per cent), with several recent comparable transactions further supporting the adopted valuation metrics. These transactions have demonstrated renewed investor appetite for larger quality retail assets. Across the respective assets in the portfolio, revaluation uplift was minimal, reflecting subdued net income growth over the course of 2021 as the assets continue to be impacted from COVID-19 related disruption. The Independent Valuers continue to remain heavily focused on sustainable market rents and future growth rates in formulating their view of asset values.\n\nOperations net income was $228.5 million, reflecting an increase of 3.5 per cent compared to December 2020. This result was impacted by further rental relief given to tenants due to the reinstatement of the Code of Conduct in NSW from 13 July 2021 and Commercial Tenancy Relief Scheme in Victoria from 28 July 2021. For the full year, this has resulted in a reduction in income of $62.9 million from a combination of processed and expected rent waivers and an estimate of loss from uncollected rent. The result was further impacted by an increase in operating costs of the assets and negative leasing spreads reducing rental income.\n\nDespite the impacts from COVID-19 the portfolio remains resilient with improved occupancy of 99.1 per cent (2020: 98.0 per cent). The Group completed 561 leasing deals during the year, with an average leasing spread of -8.5 per cent. Deals achieved fixed rental increases averaging 4.3 per cent and an average lease term of 4.3 years.\n\nCentre sales over the full year were up 3.7 per cent, and Total Specialty sales were up 6.2 per cent, with sales growth driven by a resurgence in discretionary spending, particularly in Fashion, Dining, Health and Beauty.\n\n## Development net income\n\nDevelopment net income was $5.4 million, primarily from divestment of Rouse Hill land being subject to compulsory acquisition by the New South Wales Government for the department of NSW Health Infrastructure's new public hospital. A preliminary determination by the Valuer General is yet to be received, with the final sale price determination and settlement expected in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Prospects\n\n## Group\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the Australian economy and GPT's operating environment however, the governments' acceleration of vaccinations and booster programs in the second half of 2021 provides optimism that the impacts from COVID-19 should be less severe during the course of 2022 than experienced in prior years.\n\nWith the rapid spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in late 2021, health and safety measures were reintroduced in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, including mandatory mask-wearing in indoor office and retail settings, and advice to work from home where possible. These measures remain in place and continue to impact office space utilisation and visitations to shopping centres.\n\nCurrent indications suggest that the Omicron variant will weigh on economic activity for a relatively short period, and severe lockdown measures experienced in the second half of 2021 are less likely to be re-instated. The NSW and Victorian governments announced in January 2022 that the Commercial Tenancy Code of Conduct requiring landlords to provide rent relief to eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19 had been extended to March 2022.\n\nIn outlining the Group's prospects, management considers it has applied its best judgement at this point in time. Clearly there remains a high level of uncertainty as we continue to navigate pandemic related impacts, supply chain disruption and the outlook for interest rates and inflation.\n\nGPT has a high quality diversified real estate portfolio currently valued at $16.2 billion. Valuations for high quality assets continue to be supported by ongoing domestic and offshore investor demand particularly for Office and Logistics assets. Portfolio occupancy at 31 December 2021 was 97.7 per cent and we are expecting that the quality of our portfolio will continue to attract ongoing tenant demand.\n\nThe Group has a Logistics development pipeline of approximately $1.6 billion, providing the opportunity for further growth in this sector. GPT is also targeting to commence the Rouse Hill Town Centre expansion at the end of 2022.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's net gearing was 28.2 per cent, with cash and undrawn bank facilities totalling $0.9 billion and no significant loan expiries until 2023. GPT has strong credit ratings of 'A negative' and 'A2 stable' by S&P and Moody's respectively.\n\n## Office\n\nIn 2021 broader adoption of hybrid work practices remained evident, as many of our tenants' employees worked from home for part of their working week. While this trend is expected to continue, tenant feedback suggests that the physical workplace remains important for most organisations to shape culture, facilitate collaboration and learning experiences, and implement business growth opportunities.\n\nFollowing the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions in the last quarter of 2021, we saw a material increase in office attendance, particularly in Sydney, coupled with a step up in new leasing enquiries. While this has slowed with the Omicron variant, lead indicators for Office demand remain positive, with ongoing economic growth and unemployment falling to the lowest level since 2008. The jobless rate is expected to fall further through the course of 2022.\n\nOffice vacancy, however, remains elevated across each of the markets that GPT participates in. Vacancy is expected to remain above long-term average levels for the year ahead and accordingly tenant incentives are likely to continue to be elevated. GPT currently has 7 per cent (by area) of its Office portfolio vacant following the completion of two development projects in 2021. In 2022, 11 per cent of the portfolio's leases (by income) expire, and our team are actively pursuing opportunities to secure tenants for this space. Tenant demand is most robust for prime space, supporting our view that many businesses will take the opportunity to upgrade their space and seek out accommodation in better quality office buildings. Our assets have an average NABERS energy rating of 5.8 Stars and we expect an increasing number of office tenants will seek to be located in assets with strong environmental credentials.\n\n## Logistics\n\nThe Logistics portfolio continues to deliver strong results for the Group, with structural tailwinds driving tenant and investor demand. Focus on the efficient movement\n\nof goods and inventory management, along with increasing penetration of e-commerce is expected to underpin demand for prime Logistics space. Vacancy rates remain low in the core markets nationwide and investor demand for Logistics assets has resulted in strong valuation growth. These trends are expected to be sustained.\n\nThe Group successfully completed four developments in 2021 and expects to deliver a further four developments during 2022. The Group's Logistics development pipeline currently has an estimated end value of approximately $1.6 billion, which positions GPT well to continue to benefit from ongoing demand in this sector. 14\n\nThe Group's high quality Logistics portfolio, of which GPT has developed over 40 per cent, has a Weighted Average Lease Expiry of 6.5 years, occupancy of 98.8 per cent and is well supported by a diverse tenant base, with 75 per cent of income generated from ASX listed and multinational companies.\n\n## Retail\n\nIn the first half of 2021, the Group's Retail portfolio experienced an improvement in customer visitations and sales turnover compared to the previous year. However, in the middle of the year, the reintroduction of lockdowns in NSW and Victoria significantly impacted trading conditions until restrictions lifted towards the end of the year.\n\nThe emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and mandated mask-wearing for indoor retail settings in many of GPT's markets are expected to continue to disrupt the trading environment for the short term. However, as we have seen previously, as COVID-19 cases subside and measures such as mandated mask-wearing lift, we expect an improvement in customer visitations and retail sales at our shopping centres.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As workers return to their offices and the Melbourne CBD is reactivated, we expect the recovery of Melbourne Central's trading performance to accelerate.\n\nIn February 2022, GPT and the GPT Wholesale Shopping Centre Fund (GWSCF) announced the sale of Casuarina Square, with settlement expected by the end of March 2022. Casuarina Square was considered a non-core asset for GPT. Capital proceeds from the sale will be redeployed into new opportunities to generate long-term value for investors, such as the expansion of the Rouse Hill Town Centre, which we are targeting to commence at the end of 2022.\n\nPortfolio occupancy as at 31 December was 99.1 per cent, and all specialty store leases continue to have fixed base rents with annual increases. The portfolio revaluation was stable over the year, with investment metrics supported by several significant transactions completed in the market.\n\nThe Group's high quality Retail portfolio, located primarily in trade areas with above average population growth, is anticipated to benefit from the expected economic growth, low unemployment and high household savings rates once conditions normalise.\n\n## Funds Management\n\nGPT has a well-established Funds Management platform with $14.0 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM). The GPT Wholesale Office Fund (GWOF) is Australia's largest wholesale office fund with AUM of $9.8 billion, and GWSCF has AUM of $3.5 billion. In 2021 we established a partnership with global investment group QuadReal, to invest in the Logistics sector with an initial fund size of $800 million (GPT share 50.1 per cent). Given the success GPT has had in identifying investment opportunities, GPT and QuadReal agreed to increase their capital allocation to the partnership to target total investments of $1 billion, with GPT's investment in the partnership remaining at 50.1 per cent.\n\nGWOF has an extensive development pipeline of more than $3.5 billion which is continuing to activate to deliver enhanced returns for investors and growth in AUM. The Queen & Collins, Melbourne development, currently valued at $506 million reached practical completion in June 2021, and the development of 51 Flinders Lane, Melbourne, which has an estimated end value of $535 million also commenced during the period.\n\nGWSCF divested Wollongong Central in December 2021 and post year-end exchanged on the sale of Casuarina Square. GWSCF intends to recycle proceeds from these sales into a number of mixed-use development opportunities that it is progressing, which will create longerterm value and growth for the fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe global pandemic, inflationary pressure and the commencement of unwinding of Reserve Bank of Australia monetary stimulus, continues to provide uncertainty in relation to GPT's operating conditions for the year ahead.\n\nOur current expectation is that the impacts of the Omicron variant will be relatively short lived, and that before the end of the first quarter of 2022 we will see a recovery in retail sales and foot traffic at our shopping centres and an improvement in office leasing conditions as businesses return to their offices. We are also assuming that with high vaccination rates, severe lockdown measures will not be re-imposed.\n\nWhile uncertainty remains, the Group currently expects to deliver 2022 FFO in the range of 31.7 to 32.4 cents per security and a distribution of 25.0 cents per security.\n\nGPT maintains a strong balance sheet, a high quality diversified portfolio, and an experienced management team focused on creating long term value for securityholders.",

Risk Policy - The Risk Policy sets out the Group's approach to risk management, which is reviewed annually by the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee. The Risk Policy is available on GPT's website.\n- 2. Risk Appetite - The Board sets GPT's risk appetite to align with strategy, having regard to GPT's operating environment and key risks. Risk appetite is documented in our Risk Appetite Statement, against which all key investment decisions are assessed.\n- 3. Risk Governance - The Board is supported in its oversight of the Risk Management Framework by the Sustainability and Risk Committee, which reviews the effectiveness of the Framework, and by the Audit Committee, the Leadership Team and the Investment Committee.\n- 4. Risk Culture - GPT maintains a transparent and accountable culture where risk is actively considered and managed in our dayto-day activities. Risk culture is assessed as part of all internal audits and tracked using a Risk Culture Scorecard.\n- 5. Risk Management Processes and Systems - GPT has robust processes and systems in place for the identification, assessment, treatment, assurance and reporting of risk.\n\n## Managing risk in the COVID-19 operating environment\n\nGPT has responded proactively to the COVID-19 pandemic at both the governance and operational levels, with pandemic processes and procedures now incorporated into our usual business activities. In all aspects of our approach we have prioritised health and safety, followed government guidance and directives, and been flexible as the situation continues to evolve.\n\nThe focus of our risk management response has been in the areas set out below.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nThe health and safety of our people, customers, contractors and other users of our assets has been our priority throughout the pandemic. We have consulted widely in our industry and beyond, and implemented best practice safety initiatives across our portfolio. These include cleaning, hygiene and social distancing measures, COVID-19 awareness training, and wellbeing support for our people.\n\n## Governance\n\nGPT's Risk Management Framework has been reviewed to ensure that it continues to function effectively in the COVID-19 operating environment, where a large number of employees are working remotely and certain operations are required to be performed differently. Enhanced governance remains in place to address ongoing disruption.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nGPT defines what is material to our business by considering risks and opportunities that influence our ability to deliver on our vision, purpose and strategy. Material matters are those that have the highest likelihood and/or consequence of impacting our business and our ability to create value for our stakeholders over the long term, whether by directly impacting our assets or the communities in which we operate.\n\nTo identify what is material, GPT researches trends, consults advisors and regularly engages with our stakeholders to consider their views.\n\nIn addition, an external materiality assessment was undertaken during 2021 to inform our consideration of potentially material economic, environmental, and social matters. The assessment used the 'double' or 'nested' materiality approach to prioritise topics that are both financially material as well being material from an 'impact' perspective, in line with global best practice. The assessment confirmed that we are focused on the areas where we can make the greatest impact, which include the transition to clean energy, transitioning to a circular economy, capitalising on e-commerce and the digital economy, designing flexible and innovative workspaces, and managing efficient buildings.\n\nWe will continue to consider material risks and opportunities when developing our strategy, assessing key risks and opportunities, and preparing our corporate reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related risks\n\n## GPT outlines the steps that we are taking to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities in the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement .\n\nSummarised below, the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement has been prepared with reference to the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and is available on GPT's website.\n\nThe need for urgent global action to address climate change was never clearer or more widely accepted than during 2021, with rising momentum culminating in the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The outcome of COP26 highlights the importance of action in this decade to halve emissions by 2030 and have the best chance of keeping global temperatures below 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAs the owner and manager of a $26.9 billion portfolio of office, logistics and retail properties across Australia, GPT recognises the importance of identifying, monitoring and transparently reporting the climate change risks and opportunities that could have a material impact on our assets and on the communities in which we operate.\n\nClimate risk considerations inform key decision-making across the Group, both to minimise our emissions and to ensure the resilience of our assets to the changing environment. These range from resilience planning for a fast transition to a low carbon energy supply through to scenario modelling and adaptation planning for future physical impacts during asset acquisitions, major development projects and major lifecycle upgrades.\n\n## Governance\n\nGPT's approach to managing climate change risk is overseen by the Board and the Sustainability and Risk Committee (SRC). Management report to the SRC on sustainability matters such as climate change risks and opportunities, compliance with GPT's Environmental Management System and the delivery of environmental performance targets.\n\nGPT's Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO) is accountable for ensuring that the Group is identifying, assessing and managing material risks including climate change and other sustainability risks, in accordance with GPT's Risk Management Framework. The Chief Risk Officer manages the Sustainability Team, which is responsible for formulating and driving the implementation of GPT's environmental sustainability initiatives across the Group. The Sustainability Team work closely with business unit managers to achieve this.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe proactive identification and management of key risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, supports the achievement of the Group's strategy.\n\nGPT's overarching business strategy is outlined in the Our Strategy section of this Annual Report. In 2021, our strategy was refined to include sustainability (or ESG) leadership as a strategic priority that will drive our ability to create value into the future.\n\nOur business strategy of owning, managing and developing a diversified, high quality portfolio of property assets principally located in Australian capital cities and established regional centres ensures that we are well positioned to manage stresses and shocks, including those from climate change.\n\nThis strategy also supports a long-term approach to investment in initiatives to help achieve our sustainability goals, including tools to inform building design and operations, and climate scenario modelling. This benefits our tenants and our broader stakeholders, and improves the resilience of our assets to the impacts of physical climate risks.\n\nGPT has adopted two global warming scenarios to model the potential future impacts of climate change on our business and the resilience of our strategy. The two scenarios we have adopted align with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We have adopted a low emissions scenario aligned with RCP 2.6 and a high emissions scenario aligned with RCP 8.5.\n\nThese scenarios are used to test the resilience of the Group's strategy and to develop strategies that address climaterelated risks and opportunities. Through a series of internal workshops, we have determined the risks, opportunities and strategy impacts by considering potential transitional impacts and potential physical impacts under both the low and high emissions scenarios. Potential physical impacts could affect GPT's assets and the regions they are located in and could damage or limit their capacity to operate. Potential transitional impacts could result from policy, regulatory, or technological change and shifts in market and stakeholder expectations.\n\nA detailed summary of the scenarios adopted by GPT and the potential impacts identified by this analysis can be found in the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\nWe have implemented a range of mitigation and adaptation strategies in response to climate change, such as:\n\n- \u00bb Our preference for assets in major cities and urban areas\n- \u00bb Operating efficient carbon neutral buildings\n- \u00bb Setting and achieving carbon neutral targets\n- \u00bb Measuring and reducing embodied carbon\n- \u00bb Ensuring long-term resilience through business and asset life-cycles\n- \u00bb Ensuring our approach aligns with government resilience strategy, and\n- \u00bb Considering the impact of a future carbon price.\n\nFurther information about these strategies can be found in the Group's Climate Disclosure Statement.",

By understanding and effectively managing risk, GPT can create and protect enterprise value and provide greater certainty and confidence for investors, employees, partners, and the communities in which we operate.\n\nApplying our enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework, GPT's Risk Team monitors the operation of risk management processes and assists in the identification, assessment, treatment and monitoring of identified risks. The Risk Team supports the Leadership Team, the GPT Board, the Funds Management Board and their respective committees, in ensuring that we manage risk appropriately.\n\nClimate change risk is included on GPT's Key Risk Dashboard, which is reviewed every six months by the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee and quarterly by the Leadership Team. The Committee receives quarterly updates on the status of the actions and commitments disclosed in the metrics and targets section of GPT's Climate Disclosure Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nGPT monitors our direct climate impacts and reports on emissions, energy, water and waste for each property annually. Our Environment Data Pack includes a portfolio-level summary for all key metrics - electricity, water, fuels, recycling, and emissions - since 2005.\n\nGPT obtains independent external assurance over sustainability performance data including the following climate change metrics: energy consumption and energy production in base building and tenancies, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, waste generated, and materials recycled by grade.\n\nGPT sets annual asset-level operational targets for energy, water and waste, driven by operational optimisation programs and capital upgrades. Medium to long term operational emissions targets are also set at a portfolio level to inform energy procurement and offsets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGPT's corporate activities and business premises, including our travel and consumables, has been certified as carbon neutral by Climate Active since 2011. This certification covers material Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. GPT aims to reduce emissions through initiatives such as energy efficiency improvements at our offices and using technology to reduce the frequency of business-related flights. Emissions that can't be avoided in these areas are offset to ensure GPT's net emissions from our operations are zero.\n\n## Find out more\n\nGPT's Climate Disclosure Statement is available on our website: www.gpt.com.au",

The Board strives to ensure that GPT meets high standards of governance across our operations.\n\nCorporate governance plays an integral role in supporting GPT's business and helping it deliver on its strategy. It provides the arrangements and practices through which our strategy and business objectives are set, performance is monitored, and risks are managed. It includes a clear framework for decision making and accountability across the business.\n\n## The Board and Committees\n\nThe Board comprises six independent non-executive Directors and one Executive Director, with the Chairman being an independent non-executive Director.\n\nThe Board has established four committees - the Audit Committee, Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, Nomination Committee, and Sustainability and Risk Committee - to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. Each Committee has a formal charter setting out its responsibilities and functions, which is approved by the Board and reviewed at least every two years. The Board and Committee Charters are available on GPT's website.\n\nThe Chairman of each Committee is an independent nonexecutive Director with the appropriate qualifications and experience to carry out that role.\n\nThe Board and Committees receive regular, and as required, reports and briefings from members of the Leadership Team and senior management.\n\nThe Board and Committee Charters and GPT Corporate Governance Statement are available on our website: www.gpt.com.au\n\n## Corporate Governance Framework\n\nIndependent Assurance & Advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key areas of governance focus in 2021\n\nThe GPT Board was actively engaged in its governance responsibilities throughout the year, fulfilling their role in accordance with the Board and Committee charters.\n\nA significant area of Board focus was, and continues to be, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Group. Other focus areas for the Board during the year included:\n\n- \u00bb Oversight of the systems and processes supporting the management of GPT's culture\n- \u00bb Review of the results of the employee engagement survey and the strategies to improve employee engagement\n- \u00bb Review of GPT's remuneration framework to assess its effectiveness and relevance to the market\n- \u00bb A focus on GPT's culture including demonstrable leadership in areas of employee wellbeing and psychological safety. This has involved training for all our employees around the identification, prevention and elimination of sexual harassment and bullying in our workplace. The Board continued its oversight and focus on consequence management, behaviour and management's responses\n- \u00bb A periodic review of the Board Charter and Committee Charters and various governance policies\n- \u00bb Reinforcement of GPT's strong commitment to safety and continued improvement of GPT's safety leadership and culture\n- \u00bb The Group's strategic initiatives to create long term value, including through the growth of the Logistics and Funds Management portfolios\n- \u00bb Oversight of plans to develop capabilities across the business to drive GPT's strategic initiatives\n- \u00bb Sustainability initiatives, including the pathway for all GPT managed assets to be carbon neutral by the end of 2024\n- \u00bb A review of GPT's Risk Appetite Statement and metrics to ensure it remains appropriate to enable the achievement of GPT's strategic objectives\n- \u00bb Review and input into the continued development and implementation of GPT's diversity and inclusion strategy.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that collectively the Board has a mix of skills, experience, expertise and diversity to enable it to discharge its responsibilities. The Board also seeks to have a mix of tenure for directors to balance those who have established knowledge of GPT's business and history, with those who bring a fresh perspective and different insights.\n\nThe Board has identified the skills and experience set out on page 41 as those required for GPT's Directors to provide effective governance and direction for the Group.\n\nFor each of the skills and experience identified, the level of experience is assessed using a set of objective criteria which include tertiary qualifications, relevant industry experience or qualifications, and length of experience at a senior level.",

A critical part of this is respecting the human rights of everyone we deal with, directly and indirectly.\n\nModern slavery covers a range of unethical practices that result in serious exploitation of other people for personal or commercial gain. It can include forced labour, debt bondage and human trafficking.\n\nGPT's second Modern Slavery Statement was released in December 2021 and articulates the actions we have taken and propose to take to identify and prevent modern slavery taking place within our operations and across our supply chains.\n\nThe GPT Human Rights Statement and Modern Slavery Statement are available on our website: www.gpt.com.au.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinued\n\n## Tax Transparency\n\nConsistent with our commitment to good corporate governance, GPT is committed to managing the Group's tax obligations responsibly and in compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\nThe GPT Group is a stapled entity, a common arrangement in the Australian real estate sector. Each GPT security listed on the ASX is comprised of a share in GPT Management Holdings Limited (GMH) that is 'stapled' to a unit in General Property Trust (GPT). GPT is a unit trust (Managed Investment Trust) that is treated separately to GMH for Australian tax purposes. The GPT Group conducts its business only in Australia.\n\n## Tax Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Group has a Tax Risk Management Framework that is endorsed by the Audit Committee and reflects the Group's conservative risk appetite with respect to taxation. By applying this framework, GPT is able to manage its tax obligations efficiently and ensure compliance with all tax laws and mitigate transaction-related tax risks.\n\nThe Tax Risk Management Framework provides a strong governance approach that ensures compliance with tax law through the implementation of tax related policies, processes, procedures and systems across the Group's business. The Group applies this framework across the broader business to correctly integrate the taxation implications of transactions, projects and business initiatives into day-to-day activities.\n\nPrivate tax rulings, external advice and counsel opinion are obtained as necessary to ensure the correct application of the tax law to the Group's business.\n\n## Our tax contribution\n\nThe payment of applicable taxes is an important aspect of GPT's contribution to the Australian economy. The GPT Group's real estate investment assets are held in a trust (GPT) that is owned by securityholders. Under Australian tax law rental income arising from real estate investments is taxed directly to securityholders. All other profits that arise from trading activities are earned by GMH and are subject to the Australian corporate income tax rate of 30 per cent.\n\nGPT is also subject to goods and services tax, stamp duty, council rates, land tax, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, and remits 'pay as you go' withholding taxes on behalf of employees and investors.\n\n## Tax Transparency Code\n\nThe GPT Group reports in accordance with the voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC) issued by the Board of Taxation. The TTC recommends a set of principles and minimum standards for the disclosure of tax information by businesses.\n\n## Tax disclosures\n\nInformation regarding taxation of the Group is disclosed in this Annual Report.\n\n- MORE ON PAGE 91.",

The trust consolidated entity together with GPT Management Holdings Limited and its controlled entities form the stapled entity, The GPT Group (GPT or The Group).\n\nGeneral Property Trust is a registered scheme, GPT Management Holdings Limited is a company limited by shares, and GPT RE Limited is a company limited by shares, each of which is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The registered office and principal place of business is Level 51, 25 Martin Place, Sydney NSW 2000.\n\nThe Directors' Report for the year ended 31 December 2021 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and includes the following information:\n\n- \u00bb Operating and Financial Review, including information on the Group's operations and financial position, business strategies and prospects on pages 1 to 39\n- \u00bb Information on the Directors and Company Secretary on pages 43 to 45, and\n- \u00bb Board and committee meetings attendance on page 41\n- \u00bb Remuneration Report on pages 48 to 60, and\n- \u00bb Auditor's Independence Declaration on page 62.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nGPT has policies and procedures in place that are designed to ensure that where operations are subject to any particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of Australia (for example property development and property management), those obligations are identified and appropriately addressed. This includes obtaining and complying with conditions of relevant authority consents and approvals and obtaining necessary licences. GPT is not aware of any significant breaches of any environmental regulations under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia or of a State or Territory of Australia and has not incurred any significant liabilities under any such environmental legislation.\n\nGPT is subject to the reporting requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 ('NGER Act'). The NGER Act requires GPT to report its annual greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption and generation for the 12 month period from 1 July to 30 June. GPT has implemented systems and processes for the collection and calculation of the data required. The data is assured and submitted to the Australian Government Clean Energy Regulator by the legislative deadline of 31 October each year. GPT complied with the Regulator's submissions requirements for the period ended 30 June 2021 within the required timeframe.\n\nInformation about GPT's participation in the NGER program is available on our website: www.gpt.com.au.\n\n## Events subsequent to reporting date\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented economic and societal impacts and there remains significant uncertainty. In the event the COVID-19 impacts are more severe or prolonged than anticipated, this may have further adverse impacts to asset values and the operating results of the Group.

This report provides an overview of GPT's remuneration framework, including strategic objectives, the link to company and individual performance and associated reward outcomes.\n\nEntering 2021, the Committee was pleased to reinstate the Short Term Incentive Compensation (STIC) and Long Term Incentive (LTI) plans, and other employee ownership schemes reflecting a return to more stable market conditions. This followed a difficult 2020, where these programs were withdrawn and executives did not receive any increase to base salaries reflecting uncertainty and the negative impact of the pandemic on the Group's financial performance and the experience of investors and customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the return of stable market conditions was not sustained across all segments of the business for the entire year. Pleasingly, the Group's financial performance for the first half of the year tracked above target. During the second half of the year, the strength of our diversified portfolio saw the Funds Management, Office and Logistics sectors maintain momentum, while the return to pandemic conditions and resulting restrictions adversely impacted Retail's financial performance for the remainder of the year. Regardless, the Retail team worked tirelessly to partner with retailers throughout this period to ensure that they were ready to safely re-open for customers.\n\nThe reintroduction and prolonged nature of government restrictions posed significant challenges for many customers and employees. In line with our safety culture, supporting the mental health and wellbeing of our employees was of paramount importance. We are proud of management's response and our employees' resilience during this challenging period. More information can be found in the Empowered People section on pages 18 -19 of this Report.\n\n## 2021 Remuneration Outcomes\n\nPerformance rights granted under the 2019-21 LTI plan will lapse, as the hurdles of Total Return (TR) and Relative Total Securityholder Return (RTSR) were not met. This is the second consecutive LTI plan that has not vested, given the 2018-20 LTI plan also had a nil vesting outcome. As the 2020-23 LTI plan was withdrawn, executives will experience three consecutive years of nil vesting outcomes.\n\nTo determine the STIC outcome to be paid in 2022, the Committee considered the achievement of excellent outcomes against our non-financial strategic objectives achieved throughout 2021 (a performance assessment is available in the Group Scorecard on pages 52-53). However, the return to lockdown conditions and the associated effects on the retail sector meant the Group did not meet its primary target financial measure of FFO per security growth for the year, which had been set assuming a return to 'normal' conditions. The Committee also carefully weighed the considerations of all stakeholders and each of the Group's remuneration principles, placing importance on the Group's ability to attract and retain high calibre employees, amidst an increasingly competitive labour market and in the context of nil 2020 STIC and three years of nil\n\n## Key Management Personnel\n\nvesting for the LTI plan. As a result, the Committee recommended that the Board use its discretion to fund the STIC pool up to $14.0m (equivalent to a target result) allocated to reward strong performance in challenging circumstances also permitting the General Employee Security Ownership Plan (GESOP) and Broad Based Employee Security Ownership Plans (BBESOP) to operate. The Committee retained oversight of any STIC awards for the CEO's direct reports.\n\nIn taking this decision, the Committee recognises the incredible efforts demonstrated by our people over a challenging two year period to mitigate the impact of the pandemic for securityholders and we thank employees for their ongoing professionalism, dedication and commitment.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee approved a modest budget to implement a base pay review that excluded senior executives, representing an average increase of approximately 1.2 per cent for eligible employees. The budget made available for the 2022 base pay review for employees will be no more than 3 per cent. As GPT remunerates employees on a total package basis, there will be no further increase for the legislated superannuation increase effective 1 July 2022.\n\nFollowing benchmarking, the Committee determined that no changes to Non-Executive Director fees occur in 2021 (or ahead in 2022).\n\nThe Committee also considered the composition of the ASX200 AREIT Accumulation Index (the Index) for the RTSR measure for the 2021 LTI plan, and made a minor change (detailed in Section 4 on page 54) to determine a more appropriate benchmark for the Group's performance. During the year, a review of the Group's remuneration platform was also undertaken to ensure that it strikes an appropriate balance between retaining and motivating our people to deliver superior performance while aligning reward outcomes to the securityholder experience. Through this review, the Committee determined that the current platform remains fit for purpose and all elements will be retained for the 2022 performance period.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee focused on the organisation's response to the Respect@Work Inquiry, and as a result, the Board as well as all employees received sexual harassment and bullying training and reviewed the Group's policies and processes. The Committee retained oversight of all incidences and GPT's response to any sexual harassment or bullying matters.\n\nWe welcome feedback and comments from investors and stakeholders regarding this Remuneration Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tracey Horton AO\n\nCHAIRMAN OF THE HUMAN RESOURCES & REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe information provided in this Report has been audited in accordance with section 308(3C) of the Corporations Act 2001. Sydney, 14 February 2022\n\nGPT's Remuneration Report discloses information regarding our Key Management Personnel (KMP). In accordance with AASB 124 the KMP identified are the individuals responsible for planning, controlling and managing the GPT Group (being the Non-Executive Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Chief Operating Officer (COO)). The individuals appointed to these roles have responsibility for determining the outcomes of key decisions relating to the Group under a diversified business model. In contrast, other executives on the Leadership Team are solely responsible for decisions concerning the relevant divisional area.There have been no changes to the composition of KMP during the reporting period.",

Executives participate in the LTI and the Group's deferred STIC plans. Performance testing of both plans occurs in quarter one of the year following the conclusion of each performance period. Deferred STIC awards are made in equal parts cash and equity (vesting 12 months after the end of the performance period). 2 If LTI plan performance conditions are met, the requisite number of performance rights will convert to GPT securities; alternatively, performance rights will lapse. 3 All vested and unvested awards are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|

(less tax) or\n- \u203a a grant of $1,000 worth of GPT securities which must be held until the earlier of 3 years from the allocation date or cessation of employment\n- 1. Eligibility to participate in the STIC and LTI plans is role-based and typically limited to permanently employed individuals. Generally, participants must satisfy the minimum service criteria applicable under each plan and have not resigned or been subject to any formal performance management process when an award is made.\n- 2. Where deferred securities are awarded, the number allocated is determined by dividing 50% of the value of the total STIC by the 30-day VWAP immediately before the end of the performance period. The value of the award on the conversion date may vary as a result of security price having increased or decreased since that point in time. Any award for non LTI eligible employees is delivered as 100% cash.\n- 3. Participants may elect at the commencement of the LTI plan to apply additional dealing restrictions of up to a maximum of 4 years post vesting. A taxing point will arise in the financial year securities vest and become unrestricted.\n- 4. The CEO's performance rights are granted following the relevant resolution's approval at the Annual General Meeting.\n- 5.

GPT regularly reinforces its expectations of employees via compulsory training                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Risk Culture                | and direct communications from management. GPT's approach to risk management incorporates culture, people, processes and systems to enable the organisation  to realise potential opportunities whilst managing possible unintended adverse effects. GPT seeks to maintain a  transparent and accountable culture where all employees are encouraged to actively consider, discuss and respond  to risk as part of their daily activities. Directors monitor several organisational risk culture indicators each quarter  aligned to Risk Committee reporting metrics. These include metrics concerning internal audits, compliance and  unauthorised Risk Appetite Statement breaches, compliance breaches and reports to the Whistleblower Officer. |\n\n## Group Financial Performance and Incentive Outcomes\n\n## 1.

TSR is calculated as the percentage growth in GPT's security price from the last trading date of the previous financial year to the last trading date of the current financial year, together with the value of distributions received during the year, assuming that all of those distributions are reinvested into new securities. For LTI purposes, the average security price for the last 30 trading days is utilised in the calculation of the TSR.\n- 2. Total Return is defined as the sum of the change in Net Tangible Assets (NTA) per security plus distributions per security over the Performance Period, divided by the NTA per security at the beginning of the performance period.\n- 3.

Performance measures for the Executive KMP are derived from the Group Scorecard in Table 2 above and tailored to reflect their specific areas of responsibility.\n\nThe achievement of target FFO per security growth typically acts as a gateway for STIC to be awarded. In 2021 the Board used its discretion to fund a pool of up to $14 million (at target rather than maximum) for payment of STIC awards allocated to reward strong performance in challenging circumstances. The Committee reviewed the performance of KMP versus both the original KPIs and with regard to the activities essential to effectively recover from the pandemic to determine the individual STIC outcomes. For executive KMP these ranged between 54.79 to 65.71 per cent of their maximum STIC opportunity and are set out in the table below. STIC outcomes for the balance of the eligible employees 1 are ordinarily determined in March post the issue of the Remuneration Report.\n\n| Executive KMP 2   | Position                                       | Actual STIC  awarded   | Actual STIC  awarded as a  % of maximum  STIC   | % of maximum  STIC award  forfeited   | Cash  component   | Equity  component   (# of GPT  securities) 3   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Bob Johnston      | Chief Executive Officer and  Managing Director | $1,000,000             | 54.79%                                          | 45.21%                                | $500,000          | 94,411                                         |\n| Anastasia Clarke  | Chief Financial Officer                        | $575,000               | 65.71%                                          | 34.29%                                | $287,500          | 54,286                                         |\n| Mark Fookes       | Chief Operating Officer                        | $500,000               | 59.52%                                          | 40.48%                                | $250,000          | 47,205                                         |\n\n## 4.

In the event that a review results in changes, the new Board and Committee fees are effective from 1 January in the applicable year and advised in the ensuing Remuneration Report.\n- \u00bb Fees (including superannuation) paid to Non-executive Directors are subject to an aggregate limit of $1,800,000 per annum, which was approved by GPT securityholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2015. As an Executive Director, Mr Johnston does not receive fees from this pool as he is remunerated as one of GPT's senior executives.",

The MSHR is assessed by the higher of cost or the current market value (derived by multiplying the number of holdings at the end of the period by GPT's December 2021 30-day VWAP of $5.296).\n- 2. The MSHR for Non-Executive Directors is equal to 100% of board fees. Individuals have four years from commencement of employment to achieve the MSHR before it is assessed for the first time.\n- 3. Mr Whitfield was appointed to the Board in May 2020.\n\n## Remuneration Advisors\n\nDuring the year, advisors did not provide any remuneration recommendations in relation to KMPs, as defined in Section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## Clawback and Malus\n\nGPT's Clawback Policy provides the Board with the discretion to modify remuneration outcomes as a result of adverse circumstances that arise or become known after remuneration has been granted, paid or vested. Individuals who participate in the STIC and LTI are subject to these awards being adjusted, cancelled or clawed back if a trigger event occurs. No trigger events occurred in 2021, and the Board did not enact the Clawback Policy during the reporting period.\n\n## Minimum Security Holding Requirement\n\nGPT's Minimum Security Holding Policy requires Non-executive Directors, the CEO, other KMPs and members of the Leadership Team to build (initially over four years from appointment) and maintain a minimum holding of GPT securities. The guideline requires the CEO to maintain a holding equal to 150% of fixed remuneration. For Non-executive Directors, other KMP and Leadership Team members, the MSHR is equal to 100% of fixed remuneration or board fees.",

Additional information has also been provided where it is helpful to understand GPT's performance.\n\nThe notes to the financial statements are organised into the following sections:\n\nNote 1 - RESULT FOR THE YEAR: focuses on results and performance of GPT.\n\nNotes 2 to 9 - OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES: provides information on the assets and liabilities used to generate GPT's trading performance.\n\nNotes 10 to 15 - CAPITAL STRUCTURE: outlines how GPT manages its capital structure and various financial risks.\n\nNotes 16 to 26 - OTHER DISCLOSURE ITEMS: provides information on other items that must be disclosed to comply with Australian Accounting Standards and other regulatory pronouncements.\n\n## Key judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nIn applying GPT's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements, estimates and assumptions regarding future events.\n\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created heightened levels of economic uncertainty, resulting in management's judgements and estimates having a greater impact on the result for the period than normal.\n\nGPT has assessed key judgements and estimates in light of COVID-19 and adjusted underlying assumptions accordingly.\n\nManagement has made key assumptions relating to the levels of debt forgiveness (rent waivers) to be provided to tenants (including both eligible SME tenants as defined by the commercial tenancy Code of Conduct, and other impacted tenants). While progress has been made in finalising agreements under the Code of Conduct, there are still a number of deals that remain unresolved. Therefore, management has used their judgement to determine estimated amounts of rent waivers for the year to 31 December 2021. These have been reflected as a write-off of trade receivables.\n\nFor remaining uncollected trade receivables at 31 December 2021, management has assessed that there is an increased level of risk associated with the collection of these balances due to the financial impacts of the pandemic on tenants. Management has therefore made judgements in relation to the likelihood of collecting these amounts, which have been reflected in the estimated credit loss allowance for trade receivables. See note 4.\n\nThe social distancing and mobility restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated several existing trends impacting GPT's properties, such as online shopping and flexible working. Changes in shopping behaviours have resulted in an increase in demand for well-located logistics facilities to service increased online spending. This trend is also accelerating the transition to tenancies offering experience based services in our retail assets. The increased adoption of flexible working has impacted traffic at our office properties and has increased the focus on the provision of flexible work spaces within these properties. The extent and pace of the adoption of these trends in the future have the potential to impact future investment property income and prices, the estimated impacts of which are reflected in the property valuations. Management have reviewed the investment property valuations for both accuracy and the reasonableness of assumptions used to determine fair value. See note 2(c) for information on GPT's valuation process, and note 2(d) for a sensitivity analysis showing indicative movements in investment property valuations should certain key metrics differ from those assumed in the valuations.\n\nThe following judgements, estimates and assumptions have the potential to have a material impact on the financial statements:\n\n| Area of judgements and estimates   | Assumptions underlying                           | Note       |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Lease liabilities                  | Lease term, incremental borrowing rate           | 2, 25      |\n| Investment properties *            | Fair value                                       | 2          |\n| Trade receivables *                | Measurement of expected credit loss              | 4          |\n| Management rights                  | Impairment trigger and recoverable amounts       | 5          |\n| IT development and software        | Impairment trigger and recoverable amounts       | 5          |\n| Inventories                        | Lower of cost and net realisable value           | 6          |\n| Deferred tax assets                | Recoverability                                   | 9          |\n| Security based payments            | Fair value                                       | 20         |\n| Equity accounted investments       | Assessment of control versus disclosure guidance | 25(c)      |\n| Right-of-use assets *              | Recoverable amount                               | 25(d)(vii) |\n\nItems marked with * contain judgements and estimates which have been significantly impacted by COVID-19 in either the current or comparative periods.\n\n## RESULT FOR THE YEAR\n\n## 1. Segment Information\n\nGPT's operating segments are described in the following table. The chief operating decision makers monitor the performance of the business on the basis of Funds from Operations (FFO) for each segment. FFO represents GPT's underlying and recurring earnings from its operations, and is determined by adjusting the statutory net profit after tax for certain items which are non-cash, unrealised or capital in nature. FFO includes impairment losses related to uncollected trade receivables. FFO has been determined in accordance with guidelines issued by the Property Council of Australia.",

Investment Properties\n\n## Basis of valuation\n\nIn line with the Valuation Policy, GPT independently values each asset (including investment property assets disclosed within equity accounted investments) at least annually.\n\nValuations were undertaken having regards to the following factors:\n\n- \u00bb The government legislated the Code of Conduct for commercial tenancies, in addition to implementing various health and other economic measures which have impacted GPT's properties, tenants and cash flows; and\n- \u00bb Independent valuers analyse and then reflect transaction evidence in their key valuation assumptions, including capitalisation and discount rates, as evidence becomes available. The fair value assessment of GPT's portfolio as at the reporting date includes an estimate of the impacts of COVID-19 using information available at the time of preparation of the financial statements, including the impact of rent relief estimated to be granted to tenants. Independent valuers have also adjusted a number of assumptions, including increasing allowances for incentives and lease up periods for current vacancies, near term lease expiries and lowering forecast market rental growth rates compared to prior to COVID-19.\n\nSome of the independent valuations continue to contain material valuation uncertainty clauses during the period. Despite a higher level of transactional evidence, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on available key data remains 'high'. The valuations can be relied upon at the date of valuation however, a higher level of valuation uncertainty than normal is assumed.\n\nGPT provides factual information to the independent valuers, including passing rent information, outstanding incentives and capital expenditure forecasts which the independent valuers then use to form their own assessment. Management has reviewed the investment property valuations for both accuracy and reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The fair values are shown in the following tables.\n\n## a) Investment properties\n\n|                              | Note   | Investment   properties $M   | Less lease  liabilities 31 Dec 21 $M   | Fair value $M   | Investment   properties $M   | Less lease  liabilities 31 Dec 20 $M   | Fair value $M   |\n|------------------------------|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Retail                       | (i)    | 4,630.1                      | (6.9)                                  | 4,623.2         | 4,753.9                      | (7.8)                                  | 4,746.1         |\n| Office                       | (ii)   | 3,019.3                      | -                                      | 3,019.3         | 2,437.8                      | -                                      | 2,437.8         |\n| Logistics                    | (iii)  | 4,025.8                      | (7.9)                                  | 4,017.9         | 2,666.7                      | -                                      | 2,666.7         |\n| Properties under development | (iv)   | 279.5                        | -                                      | 279.5           | 465.2                        | -                                      | 465.2           |\n| Total investment properties  | (vi)   | 11,954.7                     | (14.8)                                 | 11,939.9        | 10,323.6                     | (7.8)                                  | 10,315.8        |",

Fair value is based on the latest independent valuation adjusting for capital expenditure and capitalisation and amortisation of lease incentives since the date of the independent valuation report. Any change in fair value is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period.\n\nProperties under development are stated at fair value at each balance date. Fair value is assessed with reference to reliable estimates of future cash flows, status of the development and the associated risk profile. Finance costs incurred on properties undergoing development are included in the cost of the development.\n\nLease incentives provided by GPT to lessees are included in the measurement of fair value of investment property and are amortised over the lease term using a straightline basis.",

Investment Properties continued\n\n## c) Valuation process - investment properties\n\nGPT manages the semi-annual valuation process to ensure that investment properties are held at fair value in GPT's accounts and that GPT is compliant with applicable regulations (for example the Corporations Act 2001 and ASIC regulations), the GPT RE Constitution and Compliance Plan.\n\nGPT has a Valuation Committee (committee) which is comprised of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Funds Management, Head of Transactions, Deputy Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel.\n\nThe purpose of the committee is to:\n\n- \u00bb approve the panel of independent valuers;\n- \u00bb review valuation inputs and assumptions;\n- \u00bb provide an escalation process where there are differences of opinion from various team members responsible for the valuation;\n- \u00bb oversee the finalisation of the valuations; and\n- \u00bb review the independent valuation sign-off and any comments that have been noted.\n\nAll independent valuations and internal tolerance checks are reviewed by the committee prior to these being presented to the Board for approval.\n\n## Independent valuations\n\nGPT's independent valuations are performed by independent professionally qualified valuers who hold recognised relevant professional qualifications and have specialised expertise in the investment properties being valued. Selected independent valuation firms form part of a panel approved by the committee. Each valuation firm is limited to undertaking consecutive valuations of a property for a maximum period of two years. Where an exceptional circumstance arises, the extension of the valuer's term must be approved by the relevant Board.\n\nThe Valuation Policy requires an independent valuation at least annually for all completed investment properties. Properties under development with a value of $100 million or greater are independently valued at least every six months. Unimproved land is independently valued at least every three years. Additional valuations will be completed in the event an internal tolerance check identifies the requirement for an independent valuation.\n\n## Internal tolerance checks\n\nEvery six months, with the exception of properties independently valued, an internal tolerance check is prepared. The internal tolerance check involves the preparation of a DCF and income capitalisation valuation for each investment property. These are produced using a capitalisation rate, terminal yield and discount rates based on comparable market evidence and recent independent valuation parameters. The tolerance measurement will typically be a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nThese internal tolerance checks are used to determine whether the book value is in line with the fair value or whether an independent valuation is required.\n\n## Properties under development\n\nThe valuation of the properties under development is determined by a development feasibility analysis for each parcel of land within each asset. The development feasibility is prepared on an 'as if complete' basis and is a combination of the income capitalisation method and where appropriate, the discounted cash flow method. The cost to complete the development includes development costs, finance costs and an appropriate profit and risk margin. These costs are deducted from the 'as if complete' valuation to determine the 'as is' basis or 'current fair value.'\n\nThe fair value of vacant land parcels is based on the market land value per square metre.\n\n## Highest and best use\n\nThe fair value of investment properties is calculated based on the highest and best use whether or not current use reflects highest and best use. For all GPT investment properties current use equates to the highest and best use, with the exception of Sydney Olympic Park Town Centre.\n\nThe masterplan for Sydney Olympic Park provides long term opportunities for the Town Centre to significantly increase the floor space developed within the precinct, subject to development and planning approvals. The assets are currently leased and any future redevelopment is also subject to the expiration of these leases.",

Investment Properties continued\n\n## d) Sensitivity information - investment properties\n\nCritical judgements are made by GPT in respect of the fair values of investment properties (including investment properties within equity accounted investments). Fair values are reviewed regularly by management with reference to independent property valuations, recent offers and market conditions, and using generally accepted market practices. The valuation process, critical assumptions underlying the valuations and information on sensitivity are disclosed below and in note 2(b).\n\nAn independent valuer will typically conduct both an income capitalisation valuation and a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for each asset, which informs a range of valuation outcomes. The valuer will then apply their expertise in determining an adopted value, which may include adopting one of these specific approaches or a mid-point of these two approaches.\n\nIn conducting the sensitivity analysis, management have selected a sample of two assets for each portfolio, for which key metrics are typical of the portfolio to which they relate. For those assets, the independent valuer conducted the sensitivity analysis in the following tables. Results for individual assets may differ based on each asset's particular attributes and market conditions.\n\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation to movements in the key variables of discount rate and market rental growth rates.\n\n## i) Retail valuation sensitivity\n\n| Discount Rate                        | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Impact to valuation                  | 2.1%      | (2.0%)  |\n| 10 Year Specialty Growth Rate        | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n| Impact to valuation                  | (1.6%)    | 1.7%    |\n| ii) Office valuation sensitivity     |           |         |\n| Discount Rate                        | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n| Impact to valuation                  | 2.1%      | (2.1%)  |\n| 10 Year Growth Rate                  | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n| Impact to valuation                  | (2.0%)    | 2.1%    |\n| iii) Logistics valuation sensitivity |           |         |\n| Discount Rate                        | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n| Impact to valuation                  | 2.0%      | (2.0%)  |\n| 10 Year Growth Rate                  | (0.25%)   | 0.25%   |\n| Impact to valuation                  | (2.0%)    | 1.9%    |\n\n## e) Lease payments to be received\n\nLease amounts to be received not recognised in the financial statements at balance date are as follows:\n\n|                                     | 31 Dec 21  $M   | 31 Dec 20  $M   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Less than 1 year                    | 582.5           | 550.0           |\n| 2 years                             | 507.2           | 478.1           |\n| 3 years                             | 446.5           | 398.5           |\n| 4 years                             | 382.0           | 337.9           |\n| 5 years                             | 312.1           | 278.1           |\n| Due after five years                | 1,055.1         | 1,021.2         |\n| Total lease payments to be received | 3,285.4         | 3,063.8         |\n\nLease amounts to be received includes future amounts to be received on non-cancellable operating leases, not recognised in the financial statements at balance date.

The Code of Conduct sets out principles to guide discussions between commercial landlords and SME tenants and is legislated and regulated by the states and territories.\n\nThe application of the Code of Conduct requires GPT to engage with each of its SME tenants and provide cashflow support in a fair and proportionate manner during the COVID-19 period. Importantly, the Code of Conduct allows GPT to negotiate commercial outcomes on a case by case basis for those SMEs most impacted. GPT has also engaged with non-SME tenants who have sought assistance but are not eligible under the Code of Conduct. Assistance provided to tenants under the Code of Conduct has taken the form of rent waivers, rent payment deferral or a combination of the two. While steady progress has been made in finalising agreements under the Code of Conduct, there are still a number of deals that remain unresolved.\n\nReceivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method less any allowance under the 'expected credit loss' (ECL) model. GPT holds these financial assets in order to collect the contractual cash flows, and the contractual terms are solely payments of outstanding principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAll loans and receivables with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance date are classified as non-current assets.\n\n## Rent waivers and other write-offs\n\nDebts which management has determined will be subject to a rent waiver, or are otherwise uncollectible have been written off as at 31 December 2021, in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9 Financial Instruments. Bad debt write offs of $41.6 million (31 December 2020: $44.7 million) relating to COVID-19 abatements and other non recoverable amounts have been recognised during the financial year. Waivers which have been reflected on invoices issued to tenants and do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, have been shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Trade and Other Receivables continued\n\n- b) Other receivables continued\n\n## Estimated credit loss allowance\n\nFor remaining trade and other receivables balances which have not been written off, management has assessed whether these balances are 'credit impaired', and recognised a loss allowance equal to the lifetime ECL.\n\n## Recoverability of receivables\n\nAt each reporting date, GPT assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are 'credit-impaired'. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset is expected to occur.\n\nLifetime ECLs result from all possible default events over the expected life of the trade receivable and are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to GPT in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that GPT expects to receive). A default on trade receivables is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments when they fall due and management determines that the debt is uncollectible, or where management forgives all or part of the debt.\n\nGPT analyses the age of outstanding receivable balances and applies historical default percentages adjusted for other current observable data as a means to estimate lifetime ECL. Other current observable data may include:\n\n- \u00bb forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment, interest rates, gross domestic product and inflation;\n- \u00bb financial difficulties of a counterparty or probability that a counterparty will enter bankruptcy; and\n- \u00bb conditions specific to the asset to which the receivable relates.\n\nDebts that are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19 GPT has reviewed its methodology to determine an estimated lifetime ECL, with historical default percentages no longer the most appropriate means of predicting future default events. At 31 December 2021, GPT has assessed the likelihood of future defaults and debt forgiveness taking into account several factors. These include the risk profile of the tenant, the age of the debt, the asset location, and tenant cash payment trends after the completion of rent relief agreements and other economic conditions impacting the tenants' ability to pay.\n\nThis has resulted in an ECL allowance of $30.9 million being recognised as at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $19.3 million). The remaining net balance of trade receivables (excluding accrued income and related party receivables) is $11.5 million (31 December 2020: $30.9 million).\n\n## 5.

Rights are initially measured at cost and subsequently amortised over their useful life.\n\nFor the management rights of Highpoint Shopping Centre, management considers the useful life as indefinite as there is no fixed term included in the management agreement. Therefore, GPT tests for impairment at balance date. Assets are impaired if the carrying value exceeds their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined using a discounted cash flow. A 13% pre-tax discount rate and 2.98% growth rate have been applied to these asset specific cash flow projections.\n\nDuring the year management tested all inputs in the fair value assessment of the management rights and have adjusted these inputs where they have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this assessment management has identified that the carrying value is zero at year end and as such the asset has been fully impaired.\n\n## IT development and software\n\nCosts incurred in developing systems and acquiring software and licenses that will contribute future financial benefits and which the Group controls (therefore excluding Software as a Service) are capitalised until the software is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These include external direct costs of materials and services and direct payroll and payroll related costs of employees' time spent on the project. Amortisation is calculated on a straightline basis over the length of time over which the benefits are expected to be received, generally ranging from 3 to 10 years.\n\nIT development and software are assessed for impairment at each reporting date by evaluating if any impairment triggers exist. Where impairment triggers exist, management calculate the recoverable amount. The asset is impaired if the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Critical judgements are made by GPT in setting appropriate impairment triggers and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount. Impairment is also recognised where management intends to transition software from an on premises solution to a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution in accordance with the IFRIC agenda decision.\n\nManagement has reviewed the impairment indicators for the year including the COVID-19 pandemic and have recorded an impairment where appropriate. Management believe the carrying value reflects the recoverable amount.\n\n## 6.

GPT have recorded the disposal at the most recent offer price of $19.9 million. This amount is reflected as a receivable. The final sale price to be received is yet to be determined.\n\nOn 29 November 2021, GPT acquired three assets as part of the Ascot property portfolio for a total of $8.7 million (carrying value at 31 December 2021: $8.4 million) which are expected to be sold in the next 12 months and are therefore classified as properties held for sale.\n\n## Cost\n\nCost includes the cost of acquisition and any subsequent capital addition. For development properties, cost also includes development, finance costs and all other costs directly related to specific projects including an allocation of direct overhead expenses. Post completion of the development, finance costs and other holding charges are expensed as incurred. A total of $1.9 million in finance costs have been capitalised to inventory for the year ended 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $2.6 million). When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which the related revenue is recognised. For wholly owned, internally managed developments, this expense is determined on a forward looking, revenue proportional basis.",

Taxation continued\n\n## Trust\n\nProperty investments are held by the Trust for the purposes of earning rental income. Under current tax legislation, the Trust is not liable for income tax provided the taxable income of the Trust including realised capital gains is attributed in full to its securityholders each financial year. Securityholders are subject to income tax at their own marginal tax rates on amounts attributable to them.\n\n## Company\n\nIncome tax expense for the financial year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income. This is adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - recognition\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available to utilise them. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities and assets - measurement\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance date.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between accounting carrying amounts and the tax cost bases of assets and liabilities, other than for the following:\n\n- \u00bb Where taxable temporary differences relate to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures:\n- \u203a Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- \u203a Deferred tax assets are not recognised if it is not probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will not be available to utilise the temporary differences.\n\n## Tax relating to equity items\n\nIncome taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe Australian Accounting Standards Board have issued a Draft Appendix to the Tax Transparency Code outlining the method to calculate the effective tax rate as shown in note 9(b), using:\n\n- \u00bb accounting profit before tax adjusted to exclude transactions which are not reflected in the calculation of income tax expense, including;\n- \u203a Trust taxable income which is attributed in full to its securityholders; and\n- \u203a Non tax related material items in the Company; and\n- \u00bb tax expense adjusted to exclude carry forward tax losses that have been recognised and prior year tax under/overstatements.\n\n## Attribution managed investment trust regime\n\nThe Trust made an election to be an attribution managed investment trust (AMIT). Under Australia's taxation laws, unitholders of the Trust pay income tax to the Federal Government on taxable income that is attributed to them as part of the Trust distribution process.\n\nIn the case where a GPT unitholder is an Australian resident, the unitholder pays tax on the taxable income attributed to them at their own applicable tax rate. Where the unitholder is a non-resident, Managed Investment Trust (MIT) withholding tax applies at the rate of 15 per cent where the place of payment is in a country that has an exchange of information agreement with Australia. If such an agreement does not exist, a withholding tax rate of 30 per cent or 45 per cent applies, depending on the circumstances.",

The Board is responsible for monitoring and approving the capital management framework within which management operates. The purpose of the framework is to safeguard GPT's ability to continue as a going concern while optimising its debt and equity structure. GPT aims to maintain a capital structure which includes net gearing levels within a range of 25 to 35 per cent that is consistent with a stable investment grade credit rating in the 'A category'.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, GPT is credit rated A (negative) / A2 stable by Standard and Poor's (S&P) and Moody's Investor Services (Moody's) respectively. The ratings are important as they reflect the investment grade credit rating of GPT which allows access to global capital markets to fund its development pipeline and future acquisition investment opportunities. The stronger ratings improve both the availability of capital, in terms of amount and tenor, and reduce the cost at which it can be obtained.\n\nGPT is able to vary the capital mix by:\n\n- \u00bb issuing stapled securities;\n- \u00bb buying back stapled securities;\n- \u00bb activating the distribution reinvestment plan;\n- \u00bb adjusting the amount of distributions paid to stapled securityholders;\n- \u00bb selling assets to reduce borrowings; or\n- \u00bb increasing borrowings.\n\n## 10.

The movement in the reserve is recognised in net profit when the investment in the foreign controlled entity is disposed.\n\n## Cash flow hedge reserve\n\nThe reserve records the portion of the unrealised gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge relationship inclusive of the share of cash flow hedge reserve of equity accounted investments.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe reserve records the changes in the fair value of the currency basis that is part of cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge foreign currency borrowings, but is excluded from the hedge designations. This reserve is inclusive of the share of cost of hedging reserve of equity accounted investments. Refer to note 14 for further details.\n\n## Employee incentive scheme reserve\n\nThe reserve is used to recognise the fair value of equity-settled security based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration. Refer to note 20 for further details of the security based payments.\n\n## d) Retained earnings / accumulated losses\n\n|                                                                                                         | Note   | Trust $M   | stapled to GPT  1 $M   | Total  1 $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|------------------------|---------------|\n| Balance at 1 January 2020                                                                               |        | 3,123.5    | (827.5)                | 2,296.0       |\n| Net (loss)/profit for the financial year                                                                |        | (240.1)    | 26.9                   | (213.2)       |\n| Less: Distributions paid/payable to ordinary stapled securityholders                                    | 12     | (181.2)    | -                      | (181.2)       |\n| Reclassification of employee incentive security scheme reserve to retained earnings/ accumulated losses |        | (1.3)      | -                      | (1.3)         |\n| Balance at 31 December 2020                                                                             |        | 2,700.9    | (800.6)                | 1,900.3       |\n| Balance at 1 January 2021                                                                               |        | 2,700.9    | (800.6)                | 1,900.3       |\n| Net profit/(loss) for the financial year                                                                |        | 1,433.7    | (10.9)                 | 1,422.8       |\n| Less: Distributions paid/payable to ordinary stapled securityholders                                    | 12     | (511.9)    | -                      | (511.9)       |\n| Reclassification of employee incentive security scheme reserve to retained earnings/ accumulated losses |        | 1.9        | (0.2)                  | 1.7           |\n| Balance at 31 December 2021                                                                             |        | 3,624.6    | (811.7)                | 2,812.9       |\n\nOther entities",

per stapled security is calculated as net profit/loss attributable to ordinary stapled securityholders of GPT, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary stapled securities outstanding during the financial year which is adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary stapled securities issued during the financial year. Diluted earnings per stapled security is calculated as net profit/loss attributable to ordinary stapled securityholders of GPT divided by the weighted average number of ordinary stapled securities and dilutive potential ordinary stapled securities. Where there is no difference between basic earnings per stapled security and diluted earnings per stapled security, the term basic and diluted earnings per stapled ordinary security is used.",

Where a modification is substantial, it will be accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and a recognition of a new financial liability. Where the modification does not result in extinguishment, the difference between the existing carrying amount of the financial liability and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as a gain / loss on modification of financial liabilities. GPT management has assessed the modification of terms requirements within AASB 9 and have concluded that these will not have a material impact for the Group.",

Financial Risk Management\n\nThe GPT Board approve GPT's treasury policy which:\n\n- \u00bb establishes a framework for the management of risks inherent to the capital structure;\n- \u00bb defines the role of GPT's treasury; and\n- \u00bb sets out the policies, limits, monitoring and reporting requirements for cash, borrowings, liquidity, credit risk, foreign exchange, interest rate and other derivative instruments.\n\n## a) Derivatives\n\nAs part of normal business operations, GPT is exposed to financial market risks which are principally interest rate risk on borrowings and foreign exchange rate risk on foreign currency borrowings. GPT manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps (fixed to floating, floating to fixed and floating to floating swaps), cross currency interest rate swaps and option based derivatives. Regular coupons under these instruments are reported in finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income along with the interest cost on borrowings to which it relates.\n\nDerivatives are carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value and classified according to their contractual maturities. If they do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in fair value (including amortisation of upfront payment including premiums) are recognised in net gain / loss on fair value movements of derivatives in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and are designated in hedge relationships, the recognition of any gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to note 14(b) on hedge accounting. All of GPT's derivatives were valued using market observable inputs (level 2). For additional fair value disclosures refer to note 15.\n\n|                                                                      | 31 Dec 21  $M   | 31 Dec 20  $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Derivative Assets                                                    |                 |                 |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 68.0            | 111.4           |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | 41.8            | 34.5            |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value and cash flow hedges | 356.2           | 334.4           |\n| Total Derivative Assets                                              | 466.0           | 480.3           |\n| Derivative Liabilities                                               |                 |                 |\n| Interest Rate Swaps - AUD                                            | 56.3            | 96.3            |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value hedges               | 12.0            | 17.1            |\n| Cross Currency Interest Rate Swaps - fair value and cash flow hedges | -               | 0.2             |\n| Total Derivative Liabilities                                         | 68.3            | 113.6           |\n| Net Derivative Assets                                                | 397.7           | 366.7           |\n\nGPT enters into ISDA (International Swap Derivatives Association) Master Agreements with its derivative counterparties. Under the terms of these agreements, where certain credit events occur, there is a right to set-off the position owing/receivable to a single counterparty to a net position as long as all outstanding derivatives with that counterparty are terminated. As GPT does not presently have a legally enforceable right to set-off, these amounts have not been offset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. In the event a credit event occurred, the ISDA Master Agreement would have the effect of netting, allowing a reduction to derivative assets and derivative liabilities of the same amount of $66.3 million (31 December 2020: $110.7 million).\n\n## b) Hedge Accounting\n\nGPT's objective is to manage the risk of volatility in FFO and NTA and whilst economic hedges exist to manage its financial market risks, GPT has elected to apply hedge accounting only in relation to foreign currency borrowings. Foreign exchange and interest rate risk arising from foreign currency borrowings is managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency fixed interest rate cash flows into Australian dollar floating interest rate cash flows.\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, GPT designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item and the proposed effectiveness of the risk management objective the hedge relationship addresses. GPT fully hedges 100% of its foreign currency exposure in respect of foreign currency borrowings with cross currency interest rate swaps and therefore applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. This means that whilst there are fair value movements from period to period, there is 100% matching of cash flows, resulting in nil fair value movements over the duration of the borrowings nor FFO impact in any period. On an ongoing basis, GPT determines and documents its assessment of prospective hedge effectiveness of all hedge relationships.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps hedging foreign currency borrowings are designated as either dual fair value and cash flow hedges or fair value hedges only.",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## b) Hedge Accounting\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nA fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of the underlying item (foreign currency borrowings) that is attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign benchmark interest rates and if applicable, foreign exchange rates). All changes in the fair value of the foreign currency borrowings relating to the risk being hedged are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income together with the changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps with the net difference reflecting the hedge ineffectiveness.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nA cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk (movements in foreign exchange rates) associated with a liability (foreign currency borrowings). The portion of the fair value gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is effective (that which offsets the movement on the hedged item attributable to foreign exchange movements) is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised as net impact of foreign currency borrowings and associated hedging gain or loss directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Currency basis\n\nA component of the cross currency interest rate swap is the currency basis. This is a liquidity premium that is charged for exchanging different currencies, and changes over time. Where currency basis have been included in fair value hedge designations, movement in currency basis are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In all other cases, currency basis have been excluded from GPT's fair value hedge designation with movements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve in equity.\n\n## Hedging Instruments\n\nThe following table shows the nominal amount of derivatives designated in cash flow and/or fair value hedge relationships in time bands based on the maturity of each derivative.\n\n31 Dec 21\n\n31 Dec 20\n\n|                                      | Less than  1 year  $M   | 1 to 5  years  $M   | Over  5 years  $M   | Total  $M   | Less than  1 year  $M   | 1 to 5  years  $M   | Over  5 years  $M   | Total  $M   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps   |                         |                     |                     |             |                         |                     |                     |             |\n| USD exposure                         |                         |                     |                     |             |                         |                     |                     |             |\n| AUD nominal amount                   | \\_                       | 145.8               | 1,311.9             | 1,457.7     | \\_                       | 145.8               | 1,311.9             | 1,457.7     |\n| Average receive fixed interest rate  | \\_                       | 3.6%                | 3.8%                |             | \\_                       | 3.6%                | 3.8%                |             |\n| Average contracted FX rate (AUD/USD) | \\_                       | 1.0283              | 0.8042              |             | \\_                       | 1.0283              | 0.8042              |             |\n| HKD exposure                         |                         |                     |                     |             |                         |                     |                     |             |\n| AUD nominal amount                   | \\_                       | 69.1                | 380.6               | 449.7       | \\_                       | \\_                   | 449.7               | 449.7       |\n| Average receive fixed interest rate  | \\_                       | 3.0%                | 2.9%                |             | \\_                       | \\_                   | 2.9%                |             |\n| Average contracted FX rate (AUD/HKD) | \\_                       | 5.7890              | 6.3747              |             | \\_                       | \\_                   | 6.2847              |             |\n\nThe following table shows the impact on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income relating to hedge ineffectiveness of fair value hedges and the impact on Other Comprehensive Income relating to movements in cash flow hedges and the cost of hedging reserve.\n\n|                                                                     | 31 Dec 21  $M   | 31 Dec 20  $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Fair Value Hedge Movements in Net profit                            |                 |                 |\n| Fair value movements on foreign borrowings                          | 7.3             | 36.3            |\n| Movement in Fair value hedges                                       | 10.3            | (51.4)          |\n| Net gain/(loss) from fair value hedge ineffectiveness in Net profit | 17.6            | (15.1)          |\n| Movement in Hedge Reserves in OCI                                   |                 |                 |\n| Movement in Cash flow hedge reserve                                 | 5.4             | (0.1)           |\n| Movement in Cost of hedging reserve                                 | 18.8            | (22.1)          |\n| Share of movement in Hedge reserves in equity accounted investments | 2.7             | (1.9)           |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in Hedge Reserves in OCI                    | 26.9            | (24.1)          |\n\nIn these hedge relationships, the main sources of ineffectiveness are:\n\n- \u00bb the effect of the counterparty and GPT's own credit risk on the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item;\n- \u00bb changes in Australian and foreign swap interest rates which will impact the fair value of the Australian dollar margin and implied foreign currency margin respectively; and\n- \u00bb changes in currency basis included within fair value hedge designations impacting the fair value of the swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item.",

Financial Risk Management continued\n\n## c) Interest rate risk\n\nGPT's primary interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. This mainly arises from borrowings. Interest rate risk inherent on borrowings issued at floating rates is managed by entering into interest rate swaps that are used to convert a portion of floating interest rate borrowings to fixed interest rates, which reduces GPT's exposure to interest rate volatility.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of GPT's gross interest rate risk exposure as at 31 December 2021 on interest bearing borrowings as well as the net effect of interest rate risk management transactions. This excludes unamortised establishment costs and fair value and other adjustments.\n\n31 Dec 21\n\n|                                             | $M      | $M      |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fixed Rate Exposure                         |         |         |\n| Fixed rate borrowings                       | 3,004.0 | 3,006.4 |\n| Borrowings hedged via interest rate swaps 1 | 247.6   | 247.6   |\n| Effective fixed rate borrowings             | 3,251.6 | 3,254.0 |\n| Floating Rate Exposure                      |         |         |\n| Floating rate borrowings                    | 1,738.2 | 672.9   |\n| Borrowings hedged via interest rate swaps 1 | (247.6) | (247.6) |\n| Effective floating rate borrowings          | 1,490.6 | 425.3   |\n\n31 Dec 20\n\n## Interest rate risk - sensitivity analysis\n\nThe impact on interest expense of a 0.25 per cent increase or decrease in market interest rates is shown below.

Refinancing risk arises when GPT is required to obtain debt to fund existing and new debt positions. GPT manages this risk by spreading sources, counterparties and maturities of borrowings in order to minimise debt concentration risk, allow averaging of credit margins over time and reducing refinance amounts.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, GPT's exposure to refinancing risk can be monitored by the spreading of its contractual maturities on borrowings in the liquidity risk table above or with the information in note 13.\n\n## f) Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment, asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. GPT's foreign exchange risk arises primarily from:\n\n- \u00bb firm commitments of highly probable forecast transactions for receipts and payments settled in foreign currencies or with prices dependent on foreign currencies; and\n- \u00bb investments in foreign assets.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk arising from borrowings denominated in foreign currency is managed with cross currency interest rate swaps which convert foreign currency exposures into Australian dollar exposures. Sensitivity to foreign exchange is deemed insignificant.",

GPT has exposure to credit risk on all financial assets included on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\n## GPT manages this risk by:\n\n- \u00bb establishing credit limits for financial institutions and monitoring credit exposures for customers to ensure that GPT only trades and invests with approved counterparties;\n- \u00bb investing and transacting derivatives with multiple counterparties that have a minimum long term credit rating of A- from S&P, or equivalent if an S&P rating is not available, minimising exposure to any one counterparty;\n- \u00bb providing loans into joint ventures, associates and third parties, only where GPT is comfortable with the underlying property exposure within that entity;\n- \u00bb regularly monitoring loans and receivables balances;\n- \u00bb regularly monitoring the performance of its associates, joint ventures and third parties; and\n- \u00bb obtaining collateral as security (where appropriate).\n\nReceivables are reviewed regularly throughout the year. A provision for doubtful debts is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. Refer to note 4 for the calculation of lifetime ECL. GPT's policy is to hold collateral as security over tenants via bank guarantees (or less frequently, collateral such as bond deposits or cash).\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2021 is the carrying amounts of financial assets recognised on GPT's Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Revenue for leases with fixed increases is recognised on a straight line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight line basis. Contingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nIn addition to revenue generated directly from the lease, rent from investment properties includes non-lease revenue earned from tenants, predominately in relation to recovery of asset operating costs, which is recognised and measured under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n\nManagement has assessed if a rent waiver constitutes a lease modification under AASB 16 and concluded that where rent waivers relate to periods after the execution of an agreement with the tenant, this constitutes a lease modification. Rent waivers relating to periods prior to the execution of an agreement are treated as write-offs under AASB 9 Financial Instruments where the rent waiver offsets a receivable from the tenant (see note 4). Waivers reflected on invoices issued to tenants and which do not relate to previous outstanding debtors, are shown as a reduction to rent from investment properties on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Performance.",

Security Based Payments\n\nGPT currently has four employee security schemes - the General Employee Security Ownership Plan (GESOP), the Broad Based Employee Security Ownership Plan (BBESOP), the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan (DSTI) and the Long Term Incentive (LTI) Scheme.\n\n## a) GESOP\n\nThe Board believes in creating ways for employees to build an ownership stake in the business. As a result, the Board introduced the GESOP in March 2010 for individuals who do not participate in the LTI.\n\nUnder the plan individuals who participate receive an additional benefit equivalent to 10 per cent of their short term incentives (STIC). The amount after the deduction of income tax is invested in GPT securities to be held for a minimum of one year. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## b) BBESOP\n\nUnder the plan individuals who are not eligible to participate in any other employee security scheme may receive $1,000 worth of GPT securities or $1,000 cash if GPT achieves at least target level performance. Securities must be held for the earlier of three years or the end of employment. The cost of this benefit is recognised as an in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## c) DSTI\n\nSince 2014, STIC is delivered to the senior executives as 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent in GPT stapled securities (a deferred component). The deferred component is rewarded in restricted securities which vest one year after award, subject to continued employment up to the vesting date.\n\n## d) LTI\n\nAt the 2009 AGM, GPT securityholders approved the introduction of a LTI plan based on performance rights.\n\nThe LTI plan covers each three year period. Awards under the LTI to eligible participants are in the form of performance rights which convert to GPT stapled securities for nil consideration if specified performance conditions for the applicable three year period are satisfied. Please refer to the Remuneration Report for detail on the performance conditions.\n\nThe Board determines those executives eligible to participate in the plan and, for each participating executive, grants a number of performance rights calculated as a percentage of their base salary divided by GPT's volume weighted average price (VWAP) for the 30-day period immediately prior to the commencement of the performance period.\n\n## Fair value of performance rights and restricted securities under DSTI and LTI\n\nThe fair value of the performance rights is recognised as an employee benefit expense (2021: $5.4 million, 2020: $(0.4) million) with a corresponding increase in the employee security scheme reserve in equity. For LTI, the fair value is measured at grant date. For DSTI, the fair value is measured at each reporting date until the restricted securities are awarded. Total share based payment expense based on the fair value is recognised over the period from the service commencement date of the performance rights to the vesting date.\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to be vested. At each reporting date, GPT revises its estimate of the number of performance rights that are expected to be exercisable and the employee benefit expense recognised each reporting period takes into account the most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nManagement have assessed the number of rights that are expected to vest for the 2019 LTI plan in relation to non-market vesting conditions (Total Return) and determined that no rights are expected to vest. In the period to 31 December 2020, management reassessed the number of rights expected to vest under the 2018 and 2019 plans, resulting in the reversal of prior period amortisation. No plan was offered for 2020.\n\nFair value of the performance rights issued under LTI is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation and the Black Scholes methodologies. Fair value of the restricted securities under DSTI is determined using the security price. The following key inputs are taken into account:\n\n2021 LTI\n\n2021 DSTI\n\n| Fair value of rights / restricted securities at period end (weighted average)   | $3.07     | $5.42     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Security price at grant date                                                    | $4.63     | N/A       |\n| Security price at period end date                                               | N/A       | $5.42     |\n| Grant date 1                                                                    | 26-Apr-21 | N/A       |\n| Vesting date                                                                    | 31-Dec-23 | 31-Dec-22 |\n| Out / (under) performance vs Index - plan to date                               | 3.8%      | N/A       |\n| Distribution Yield                                                              | 5.5%      | 4.7%      |\n| Risk free interest rate                                                         | 0.3%      | N/A       |\n| Volatility 2                                                                    | 35.8%     | N/A       |\n| Correlation                                                                     | 82.9%     | N/A       |",

Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\n\n## Implementation costs relating to Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms\n\nIn March 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) released an agenda decision relating to the application of IAS 38 Intangible Assets to Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement . Based on the observations made in IFRIC's agenda decision, the Group considers that costs an organisation incurs in relation to the configuration and customisation of SaaS platforms do not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset, as the supplier of the software and not the organisation, controls the software. As a result, these costs should be immediately expensed as incurred.\n\nUnder GPT's previous accounting policy, these costs were capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the length of time the benefits were expected to be received (refer to note 5). GPT has updated its accounting policy to comply with the IFRIC agenda decision, and applied AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors to reflect this change.\n\nGPT has restated comparative information in the financial statements to reflect this change in accounting policy, and has adjusted opening balances in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as at 1 January 2020.\n\nThe notes below disclose the impact of the change in accounting policy in the financial information of the Group at the beginning of the comparative period, during and at the end of the comparative period. Note 24(c) discloses the impact during and at the end of the current period.\n\n## a) Adjustments as at 1 January 2020\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\n| (Extract)                                              | 1 Jan 20  Prior year  $M   | Increase /  (decrease)  $M   | 1 Jan 20  Restated  $M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Assets                                                 |                            |                              |                          |\n| Non-current assets                                     |                            |                              |                          |\n| Intangible assets                                      | 35.3                       | (16.6)                       | 18.7                     |\n| Deferred tax assets                                    | 20.5                       | 5.0                          | 25.5                     |\n| Total non-current assets                               | 15,609.0                   | (11.6)                       | 15,597.4                 |\n| Total assets                                           | 15,867.8                   | (11.6)                       | 15,856.2                 |\n| Net assets                                             | 11,326.6                   | (11.6)                       | 11,315.0                 |\n| Equity                                                 |                            |                              |                          |\n| Securityholders of other entities stapled to the Trust |                            |                              |                          |\n| Accumulated losses                                     | (815.9)                    | (11.6)                       | (827.5)                  |\n| Total equity of other stapled securityholders          | (446.6)                    | (11.6)                       | (458.2)                  |\n| Total equity                                           | 11,326.6                   | (11.6)                       | 11,315.0                 |\n\n## b) Adjustments to comparative information\n\n## Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\n| (Extract)                                                                                                   | 31 Dec 20  Prior year  $M   | Increase /  (decrease)  $M   | 31 Dec 20  Restated  $M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Expenses                                                                                                    |                             |                              |                           |\n| Management and other administration costs                                                                   | 54.9                        | 4.9                          | 59.8                      |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment                                                                   | 14.4                        | (4.7)                        | 9.7                       |\n| Total expenses                                                                                              | 444.2                       | 0.2                          | 444.4                     |\n| Profit/(loss) before income tax expense                                                                     | (204.0)                     | (0.2)                        | (204.2)                   |\n| Income tax expense                                                                                          | 9.1                         | (0.1)                        | 9.0                       |\n| Net profit/(loss) for the year                                                                              | (213.1)                     | (0.1)                        | (213.2)                   |\n| Total comprehensive income/(loss) for the year                                                              | (237.2)                     | (0.1)                        | (237.3)                   |\n| Net profit/(loss) attributable to: \u00bb Securityholders of other entities stapled to the Trust                 | 27.0                        | (0.1)                        | 26.9                      |\n| Total comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to: \u00bb Securityholders of other entities stapled to the Trust | 27.0                        | (0.1)                        | 26.9                      |",

Accounting Policies\n\n## a) Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements are a general purpose financial report which has been prepared:\n\n- \u00bb in accordance with the requirements of the Trust's Constitution, Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Standards;\n- \u00bb on a going concern basis. GPT has prepared an assessment of its ability to continue as a going concern, taking into account all available information for a period of 12 months from the date of these financial statements and future cashflow assessments have been made (refer to note 25 (b)). GPT is confident in the belief that that it will realise its assets and settle its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and for at least the amounts stated in the financial statements. The net deficiency of current assets over current liabilities of $535.2 million arises as a result of the inclusion of borrowings due within 12 months (inclusive of $750.0 million of outstanding commercial paper). As set out in note 13, GPT has access to $1,633.4 million in undrawn financing facilities (prior to refinancing of the commercial paper). Refer to note 25(b) for further information on going concern;\n- \u00bb under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation for financial assets and liabilities and investment properties at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income;\n- \u00bb using consistent accounting policies with adjustments to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies being adopted by the controlled entities, associates or joint ventures; and\n- \u00bb in Australian dollars with all values rounded in the nearest hundred thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, unless otherwise stated.\n\nIn accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, the stapled entity reflects the consolidated entity. Equity attributable to other stapled entities is a form of non-controlling interest and represents the contributed equity of the Company.\n\nComparatives in the financial statements have been restated to the current year presentation.\n\nAs a result of the stapling, investors in GPT may receive payments from each component of the stapled security comprising distributions from the Trust and dividends from the Company.\n\nThe financial report was approved by the Board of Directors on 14 February 2022.\n\n## b) Going Concern\n\nGPT is of the opinion that it is able to meet its liabilities and commitments as and when they fall due for at least a period of 12 months from the reporting date. In reaching this position, GPT has taken into account the following factors:\n\n- \u00bb Access to undrawn facilities of $1,633.4 million, with net available liquidity of $934.7 million (inclusive of available cash and after allowing for refinancing of $750.0 million of outstanding commercial paper as at 31 December 2021);\n- \u00bb Weighted average debt expiry of 6.3 years, with less than $55.0 million of debt (excluding commercial paper outstanding) due between the date of this report and 31 December 2022;\n- \u00bb Interest rate hedging level of 60.0 per cent over the next 12 months;\n- \u00bb Primary covenant gearing of 28.4 per cent, compared to a covenant level of 50.0 per cent, and\n- \u00bb Interest cover ratio at 31 December 2021 of 7.5 times, compared to a covenant level of 2.0 times.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n## c) Basis of consolidation\n\n## Controlled entities\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of GPT include the assets, liabilities and results of all controlled entities for the financial year.\n\nControlled entities are all entities over which GPT has control. GPT controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity.\n\nControlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained to the date on which control is disposed. The acquisition of controlled entities is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. All intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Associates\n\nAssociates are entities over which GPT has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying voting or decision making rights of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. Management considered if GPT controls its associates and concluded that it does not based on its level of control over each associate.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, GPT's investment in associates is carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost plus post acquisition changes in GPT's share of net assets. GPT's share of the associates' result is reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Where GPT's share of losses in associates equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including any other unsecured long term receivables, GPT does not recognise any further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## Joint arrangements\n\nInvestments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations each investor has, rather than the legal structure of the joint arrangement. GPT has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined it has both joint operations and joint ventures.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nGPT has significant co-ownership interests in a number of properties through unincorporated joint ventures. These interests are held directly and jointly as tenants in common. GPT recognises its direct share of jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the consolidated financial statements under the appropriate headings. The investment properties that are directly owned as tenants in common are disclosed in note 2.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nInvestments in joint ventures are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position using the equity method which is the same method adopted for associates.\n\n## d) Other accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies that summarise the recognition and measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## i) Foreign currency translation\n\n## Functional and presentation currency\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the GPT entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate ('the functional currency').\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost are converted using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences of non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.\n\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation are taken against a foreign currency translation reserve on consolidation.\n\nWhere forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to cover any anticipated excesses of revenue less expenses within foreign joint ventures, they are converted at the ruling rates of exchange at the reporting period. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are taken to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n- d) Other accounting policies continued\n\n## ii) Goods and Services Tax (GST)\n\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST (or equivalent tax in overseas locations) except where the GST incurred on purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the tax authority, in which case the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST. The net amount of GST receivable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.\n\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority are presented as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority.\n\n## iii) Revenue\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised over time if:\n\n- \u00bb the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as the entity performs;\n- \u00bb the customer controls the asset as the entity creates or enhances it; or\n- \u00bb the seller's performance does not create an asset for which the seller has an alternative use and there is a right to payment for performance to date.\n\nWhere the above criteria is not met, revenue is recognised at a point in time. Management has assessed that there have been no significant changes to the recognition of revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nRental revenue from investment properties is recognised on a straight line basis for the minimum contracted rent over the lease term with an asset recognised as a component of investment properties relating to the fixed increases in operating lease rentals in future periods. When GPT provides lease incentives to tenants, these costs are amortised against lease income on a straight line basis.\n\nContingent rental income is recognised as revenue in the period in which it is earned.\n\nRevenue from dividends and distributions is recognised when they are declared.\n\nInterest income is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.\n\nManagement has assessed that there have been no significant changes to the recognition of other revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nS\n\nTAT\n\nE\n\nM\n\nE\n\nN\n\nT\n\nS",

Accounting Policies continued\n\n- d) Other accounting policies continued\n\n## v) Expenses\n\nProperty expenses and outgoings which include rates, taxes and other property outgoings, are recognised on an accruals basis.\n\n## vi) Finance costs\n\nFinance costs include interest on borrowings and regular coupons paid or received under derivative instruments hedging GPT's interest rate risk on a portfolio basis, amortisation of discounts or premiums relating to borrowings and amortisation of ancillary costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings. Finance costs are expensed as incurred unless they relate to a qualifying asset.\n\nA qualifying asset is an asset under development which generally takes a substantial period of time to bring to its intended use or sale. Finance costs incurred for the acquisition and construction of a qualifying asset are capitalised to the cost of the asset for the period of time that is required to complete the asset. Where funds are borrowed specifically for a development project, finance costs associated with the development facility are capitalised. Where funds are used from group borrowings, finance costs are capitalised using the relevant capitalisation rate taking into account the Group's weighted average cost of debt.\n\n## vii)  Leases\n\nPayments associated with short term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, GPT's incremental borrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated by interpolating or extrapolating secondary market yields on the Group's domestic medium term notes (MTNs) for a term equivalent to the lease. If there are no MTNs that mature within a reasonable proximity of the lease term, indicative pricing of where the Group can price a new debt capital market issue for a comparative term will be used in the calculation.\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured by:\n\n- \u00bb increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00bb reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n- \u00bb remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications.\n\nInterest on the lease liability and any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they relate. Interest on lease liabilities included in Finance costs in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income totalled $1.5 million for the year (31 December 2020 $1.9 million).\n\nThere have been no changes to the lease term or incremental borrowing rate used for the measurement of lease liabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost less depreciation and impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The cost of the asset include:\n\n- \u00bb the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00bb any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00bb any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00bb restoration cost.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term, unless they meet the definition of an investment property. Right-of-use assets which meet the definition of an investment property form part of the investment property balance and are measured at fair value in accordance with AASB 140 Investment Property (refer note 2 and the following section on ground leases).\n\nGPT determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both:\n\n- \u00bb the periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00bb periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nManagement considers all the facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.\n\nGPT tests right-of-use assets for impairment where there is an indicator that the asset may be impaired. An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.\n\nGPT has assessed the right-of-use assets for impairment indicators in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and has calculated the recoverable amount where indicators exist. This has resulted in impairment expense of $1.2 million for the year (31 December 2020: $2.9 million).\n\nGPT's right-of-use assets are all property leases.",

The lease liabilities are calculated as the net present value of the future lease payments discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThere were no changes to the incremental borrowing rate used for the measurement of lease liabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## e) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted from 1 January 2021\n\nAASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n\nAmendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amends a number of existing Accounting Standards to introduce practical expedients in relation to accounting for the modification of financial contracts and/or leases if a change results directly from IBOR reform. IBOR reform refers to the global reform of interest rate benchmarks, which includes the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBOR) with alternative benchmark rates. Amendments also allow a series of exemptions from the regular hedge accounting rules and introduce additional disclosure requirements.\n\nGPT have no financial instruments that reference an impacted IBOR benchmark rate. Some impacted IBOR benchmark rates are however utilised as inputs in the hedge accounting valuations and the transition to alternative benchmark rates by June 2023 is being assessed but is not expected to be material to GPT.\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year with the exception of new and amended standards and interpretations commencing 1 January 2021 that have been adopted where applicable. The Group has restated comparative information to reflect the March 2021 IFRIC agenda decision on Configuration or Customisation Costs in a Cloud Computing Arrangement (IAS 38 Intangible Asset ). Refer to note 24.\n\nOther than the above, there are no significant changes to GPT's financial performance and position as a result of the adoption of the new and amended accounting standards and interpretations effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021.\n\n## f) New accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted\n\nCertain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2021 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group. These standards, amendments or interpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n## 26. Events subsequent to reporting date\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented economic and societal impacts and there remains significant uncertainty. In the event the COVID-19 impacts are more severe or prolonged than anticipated, this may have further adverse impacts to asset values and the operating results of the Group. At the reporting date a definitive assessment of the future effects of COVID-19 on the Group cannot be made, as the impact will depend on the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn, with the full range of possible effects unknown.\n\nAfter the balance date, the Commercial Tenancy Code of Conduct was extended in New South Wales until 13 March 2022 and in Victoria until 15 March 2022, to provide rent relief to qualifying small and medium tenants. GPT continues to work with tenants to provide relief as required to assist with any short-term cash flow impacts.\n\nThe purchaser of Casuarina Square exercised its Call Option on 31 January 2022 and entered into a binding contract to purchase the asset (GPT's interest: 50%). Settlement of the transaction is scheduled to occur on or prior to 31 March 2022.\n\nOn 14 February 2022, the Directors declared a distribution for the half year ended 31 December 2021 of 9.9 cents per security, being $189.6 million which is expected to be paid on 28 February 2022.\n\nOther than the above, the Directors are not aware of any matter or circumstances occurring since 31 December 2021 that has significantly or may significantly affect the operations of GPT, the results of those operations or the state of affairs of GPT in the subsequent financial years.",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n## Audit scope\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u00b7 For the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of $27.7 million, which represents approximately 5% of the Group's Funds from Operations (FFO).\n- \u00b7 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.\n- \u00b7 We chose FFO because, in our view, it is the key performance indicator used by security holders to measure the performance of the Group. An explanation of what is included in FFO is located in Note 1, Segment information.\n- \u00b7 The structure of the Group is commonly referred to as a stapled group. In a stapled group, the securities of two or more entities are 'stapled' together and cannot be traded separately. In the case of the Group, the units in the Trust have been stapled to the shares in the Company. For the purposes of consolidation accounting, the Trust is the 'deemed' parent and the financial report reflects the consolidation of the Trust and its controlled entities and the Company and its controlled entities.\n- \u00b7 Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u00b7 Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit matters to the Audit Committee:\n- --Valuation of investment properties\n- --Carrying value of inventories\n- --Recoverability of trade receivables\n- \u00b7 These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.",

The value of investment properties is dependent on the valuation methodology adopted and the inputs and assumptions in the valuation models. The following are significant assumptions in establishing fair value:\n\nWe tested key controls related to the data inputs provided by the Group to external valuers, as well as key controls over review and approval of the valuations by appropriate management.\n\nWe obtained a selection of independent property market reports and also worked together with PwC Real Estate experts to develop an understanding of the prevailing market conditions and their expected impact on GPT investment properties.\n\nWe agreed the fair value in investment property valuation reports to the Group's accounting records and assessed the competency, capability and objectivity of the external valuers.",
