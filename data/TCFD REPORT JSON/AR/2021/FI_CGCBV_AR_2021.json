automation\ufffd\n\nDuring the year, we announced our agreement with SSAB to work on the introduction of fossil-free steel to the cargo handling industry\ufffd This is a signi/ficant milestone in moving toward sustainable development and a fossil-free product offering\ufffd\n\nThe year 2021 marked a considerable milestone for Kalmar as its entire portfolio became available as electrically powered versions\ufffd As a culmination of the year, Kalmar launched three new fully electrically powered solutions in December: Kalmar Electric Reachstacker, Kalmar Electric Heavy Forklift and Kalmar Ottawa Electric Terminal Tractor\ufffd With these launches Cargotec can offer electric products in all of its product categories\ufffd\n\nHiab strengthened its position in the US with the acquisition of Galfab, a US manufacturer of demountables\ufffd To meet the growing demand for truck-mounted forklifts, Hiab is also expanding its production to the United States and increasing its truck-mounted forklift production capacity in Dundalk, Ireland\ufffd\n\nIn terms of MacGregor, the focus of new offshore vessel orders has shifted to vessels supporting wind power\ufffd Despite the year-end dif/ficulties in new product developments in the offshore wind energy /field, I /firmly believe that MacGregor is well positioned to strengthen its position as a provider of wind power solutions in the future\ufffd\n\n## R&D focused on emission-reducing solutions\n\nResearch and product development expenditure in 2021 totalled EUR 102 million, representing 3\ufffd1 percent of sales\ufffd In development, our focus was on solutions that support our customers' efforts to reduce their\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperational emissions\ufffd A good example of this is Kalmar's commitment to provide an electric version of all its solutions, which I mentioned earlier\ufffd During the year, Kalmar also introduced a future range of robotised mobile equipment solutions and an automated container information solution for reachstackers for safer and more ef/ficient container movement management\ufffd\n\nAlong with its product launches during the year, Hiab announced that, in addition to the new multi-assembly unit investment in Dundalk, Ireland, the new facility will also house a global innovation and R&D centre\ufffd\n\nMacGregor's extensive R&D activities in 2021 included next generation variable frequency drive (VFD) electric cranes and a fully electrically driven heavy lift crane, among others\ufffd The VFD increases ef/ficiency by up to 50 percent, with additional bene/fits achieved through weight reduction\ufffd\n\n## Commitment to sustainability is the right thing to do\n\nCargotec has a long tradition in sustainability\ufffd We signed the UN Global Compact as early as in 2007, and in 2020 we committed to the United Nations Global Compact's Business Ambition for 1\ufffd5\u00b0C to mitigate climate change\ufffd Our strategy clearly re/flects this by aiming to reduce the CO 2 emissions in our value chain\ufffd\n\nAt the end of the year, we received a B rating from the prestigious CDP in its assessment of environmental management levels of companies and cities\ufffd This is the second year in a row for Cargotec to receive this rating, which indicates that we have taken coordinated actions on climate issues\ufffd The interest our customers and shareholders have shown in this theme during the year proves that our commitment to sustainable operation has been the right decision to make\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur eco portfolio consists of products and services that can enhance our customers' sustainability with tangible environmental bene/fits\ufffd In 2021, the eco portfolio sales represented 19 percent of our total sales\ufffd Customer interest towards eco-ef/ficient equipment is increasing, which offers us a clear business opportunity\ufffd As an example, more than a quarter of the forklift truck orders in 2021 were fully electric\ufffd\n\nOur safety performance declined slightly in 2021\ufffd The Industrial Injury Frequency Rate (IIFR) weakened at assembly sites due to disturbances in production processes, caused by component shortage\ufffd On the other hand, the IIFR improved at service organisations and at non-assembly sites\ufffd We continue our determined actions to improve occupational safety\ufffd\n\n## The year 2022 looks challenging, yet interesting\n\nIt seems that we will have to live with the Covid-19 pandemic for a while still\ufffd It is important that we protect ourselves and our fellow human beings in compliance with of/ficial guidelines\ufffd At the same time, however, we must be able to ensure the continuity of social and economic activity both globally and locally, and make sure that everyday life goes as smoothly as possible for us all\ufffd\n\nComponent shortages and global logistics challenges will continue in 2022, which may limit Cargotec's ability to respond to the growing demand\ufffd We work in close cooperation with our suppliers to ensure component availability, production and deliveries also in 2022\ufffd Our order book is strong, which gives us a good setup for 2022\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The year 2022 looks challenging, yet interesting\ufffd\n\nIn October 2020, Cargotec and Konecranes announced their combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger\ufffd The extraordinary general meetings of Cargotec and Konecranes held in December 2020 approved the merger\ufffd Various competition authorities are currently reviewing the proposed transaction\ufffd\n\nCargotec and Konecranes are awaiting the authorities' decisions and continue to work towards the merger being completed by the end of H1 2022\ufffd Until all the merger closing conditions are met and the deal is completed, both companies continue to operate fully separately and independently\ufffd More information about the merger is available in this report and at www\ufffdsustainablematerial/flow\ufffdcom\ufffd\n\nI would like to thank our employees for a job well done in a challenging environment as well as our customers, partners and shareholders for their trust during the year 2021\ufffd\n\nMika Vehvil\u00e4inen CEO, CARGOTEC",

us\ufffd The following megatrends support our strategy and journey to become a global leader in sustainable cargo /flow\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Global growth & economic development\n\n## Description\n\nPopulation growth, urbanisation, rising economic wealth and productivity shape the global economic development\ufffd The world's population today is about 7\ufffd9 billion and estimated to reach 9\ufffd7 billion by 2050\ufffd Simultaneously, the share of the world's population living in cities is expected to grow from 55 percent to almost 70 percent\ufffd At the same time, global GDP per capita is predicted to grow by roughly /five percent annually between 2020-2025\ufffd\n\n## Implications\n\nGlobal and economic growth drives consumption, world trade and demand for cargo transportation\ufffd Urbanisation requires infrastructure and construction, with logistics to sustain cities\ufffd In densely populated cities, load handling solutions must be quiet, safe and low in emissions\ufffd\n\n## Examples:\n\nKalmar One, MacGregor Cargo Boost solution, Hiab electric MOFFETT truckmounted forklifts\ufffd\n\n## Sustainability\n\n## Description\n\nToday, environmental, social and governance dimensions of sustainability increasingly guide consumer and investor behaviour\ufffd Governments, investors, companies and consumers now demand concrete actions to address climate change and protect ecosystems\ufffd Sustainability is increasingly also perceived as a good business opportunity\ufffd\n\n## Implications\n\nOur customers face increasing pressure from stakeholders to address climate change in their operations and industries\ufffd Other aspects of ESG, for instance safety, are key challenges customers need to solve and mitigate\ufffd Sustainability presents great opportunities for us to innovate new solutions that tackle the customers' challenges\ufffd\n\n## Examples:\n\nKalmar's fully electric portfolio, MacGregor's offshore wind offering\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digitalisation\n\n## Description\n\nRapid development of digital solutions continues in all areas of the society\ufffd Today we see greater emergence of disruptive technologies, such as 5G and arti/ficial intelligence, which enable data-based services and new business models\ufffd\n\n## Implications\n\nCustomers seek intelligent solutions that can support them in optimising their operations, improve productivity and safety and reduce inef/ficiencies and emissions\ufffd Our business areas are present across the cargo /flow network, enabling us to draw valuable insights across the value chain\ufffd With these insights, we are able to shape the cargo handling industry by providing value adding software, automation and intelligent solutions\ufffd\n\n## An example:\n\nKalmar Insight, MacGregor OnWatch Scout, Hiab HiConnect platform\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nClimate change is expected to have an increasing environmental and /financial impact on businesses\ufffd We have identi/fied the greatest climate-related risks and opportunities for us\ufffd\n\n## \u00b7 Investment in the right technology\n\nSustainable technologies are evolving and maturing rapidly but for now there are no clear winners de/fined\ufffd Transforming the industry and mitigating climate change with low-carbon solutions is a great opportunity, but on the contrary, failing to invest in the right technology can result in increased indirect costs if the R&D investments are not realised\ufffd\n\n## \u00b7 Offering intelligent solutions improving climate resilience\n\n- There will be a growing demand for climate change adaptation and resiliency solutions\ufffd Automation, robotisation, digitalisation and remote services remove the need to be physically present, increasing the climate change adaptation and resilience of customers' operations\ufffd\n\n## \u00b7 Extreme weather affecting operations\n\nIntensity and frequency of extreme weather events is expected to increase\ufffd A major weather event in one region may impact our suppliers, causing delays to trickle down\ufffd Business continuity plans are essential to mitigate risks\ufffd\n\n- \u00b7 Steel and lithium battery prices and availability\n- Steel prices may increase due to more aggressive CO taxation or more\n\n2 expensive production of low emission alternatives\ufffd The demand for lithium batteries is expected to increase as a result of the electri/fication trend\ufffd\n\n- \u00b7 Increase in offshore wind installations\n- Wind power generation is estimated to increase, providing great growth opportunities for MacGregor's offshore business\ufffd\n\n## Read more\n\n- Climate risks and

With our good governance and global commitments to sustainability, we strengthen societal prosperity in our operation\ufffd By encouraging our suppliers to also act sustainably, we contribute to a positive impact not only through our own global value chains but also on an industry level\ufffd We also engage with local authorities to ensure regulatory compliance in our operations, wherever we operate\ufffd\n\nIn 2021, we renewed the Cargotec Code of Conduct to ensure that our ethical standards would re/flect the changing operational environment\ufffd The Code of Conduct is the foundation of our corporate culture, establishing high standards of integrity on how we do business and how we behave in our daily work\ufffd The Code of Conduct  helps us make informed decisions, and it explains where to go for more information and guidance\ufffd The new Code of Conduct was launched in October 2021 together with an e-learning course, which all employees were required to complete by the end of the year\ufffd The Code of Conduct e-learning is designed to help us to identify potential con/flicts of interest and red /flags and guide us in our daily decision making, regardless of the

act with respect\n- \u00b7  We speak up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nViolations of Cargotec's Code of Conduct may put our people and business at risk\ufffd Hence, our speak-up culture and non-retaliation policy encourage us to openly raise and discuss compliance concerns and questions, as well as to seek guidance\ufffd At Cargotec, there are several channels for raising a concern\ufffd One can talk directly with line manager, HR or Ethics & Compliance, or use the SpeakUp line\ufffd The SpeakUp line is designed for reporting serious breaches of non-compliance, and it also allows anonymous reporting\ufffd When receiving an identi/fiable report, we do our best to maintain the reporter's anonymity\ufffd\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nFully aligned with Cargotec's own Code of Conduct, Cargotec has a speci/fic Supplier Code of Conduct, which focuses on managing sustainability risks in our supply chain\ufffd Freedom of association, abolition of child labour, human rights and forced and compulsory labour are examples of the basic principles Cargotec demands from its suppliers\ufffd The Supplier Code of Conduct process is part of Cargotec's supplier sustainability management programme, with which Cargotec aims to mitigate any risks for breaching international human rights\ufffd\n\nThe target for 2021 was to renew the supplier sustainability risk assessment process, including the supplier approval and the existing suppliers assessments processes\ufffd The renewal process was initiated with re/fining the following tools: the pre-evaluation checklist, the Supplier Code of Conduct and the Supplier Requirements, the audit checklist and the third-party self-assessment tool\ufffd Approximately 20 percent of the questions in the supplier audit checklist are related to sustainability topics\ufffd The Supplier Code of Conduct was re/fined to cover not only suppliers but also other third parties and is, once implemented, referred to as the Business Partner Code of Conduct (BPCoC)\ufffd The re/fined code is aligned with Cargotec's own Code of Conduct, which was also updated during the year\ufffd The re/fined BPCoC addresses a broader aspect of ESG topics, including CO 2 related disclosure,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nas well as disclosure on the usage of con/flict minerals\ufffd The supplier risk assessment renewal process will be /finalised during 2022 and the target for 2022 is to have all the re/fined processes implemented as part of a wider responsible sourcing programme\ufffd\n\nDuring the year, Cargotec applied for membership in the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), a cross-industry initiative, whose goal is to evolve business practice to support responsible mineral sourcing globally\ufffd The membership was approved and will take effect starting from 2022\ufffd Although Cargotec does not directly source minerals from mines or smelters/re/finers, we recognise that from our position as a downstream company we are able to play a role in addressing con/flicts, human rights abuses, as well as environmental issues related to the mining of minerals only through a strong multi-stakeholder partnership\ufffd We intend to use the RMI tools to increase transparency of the origin of so called Con/flict Minerals and Cobalt, including a duediligence tool for companies and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) to audit smelters/ re/finers, which are a key element in the supply chain for determining the origin of the relevant minerals\ufffd\n\nWe also focused our efforts on the management of hazardous substances in our products\ufffd We have taken into usage a database that helps us communicate both our legal obligations to the authorities when it comes to REACH, SCIP and other regulations, but also supports us in the communication with our suppliers of different components\ufffd During 2022, we plan to continue the dialogue on hazardous substances with our suppliers, having in mind the long-term goal of minimising and eliminating the presence of such substances in our products\ufffd\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

together, the joint target is to signi/ficantly reduce the emissions of the products we are purchasing from our suppliers\ufffd\n\nSteel is the main emission contributor from purchased goods and services\ufffd We aim to secure early access to low-emission steel when this is available on the market and re-engineer Cargotec products by using alternative green materials\ufffd\n\nAs an example, Cargotec and SSAB have formed a partnership and agreed to work on the introduction of fossil-free steel to the cargo and load handling industry in the future\ufffd The intent outlines that the companies will start coordinated development toward the use of SSAB's fossil-free steel in Cargotec's cargo handling equipment\ufffd Fossil-free steel has a signi/ficantly lower environmental impact than traditional steel\ufffd The steel demand is estimated to increase in the future and meeting this demand requires development and usage of fossil-free steel alternatives\ufffd\n\nWe have designed a broader supplier engagement model to create transparency to our purchased goods and services emissions, identify emission reduction opportunities and future proof our supply chain by setting climate requirements to our suppliers\ufffd  Through this engagement we will understand the maturity level of our suppliers and  their climate strategies, and the climate impact of their supplied

2021, the share of renewable electricity reached 47 percent in our own operations\ufffd The fuel usage by our service /fleet is the second largest contributor to the emissions in our own

the hypothesis that electric versions of the equipment result in substantial life cycle GHG savings\ufffd\n\n## Eco portfolio\n\nOur eco portfolio draws attention to solutions with potential to help our customers become low-carbon in their operations\ufffd The portfolio was established in 2017 and contains the equipment, service and software that enhance our customers' sustainability\ufffd The share of the eco portfolio sales is closely monitored and in 2021, it accounted for 19 percent (2020: 24%) of our total sales\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBesides electri/fication, automation and

towards a circular economy\ufffd Data sharing, common platforms, and collaboration act as key drivers in achieving these targets and connecting industries\ufffd Our modernisation and maintenance services ensure optimised maintenance cycles which can then support our customers to maximise the life cycle of their products, thereby saving resources\ufffd\n\nThe solutions included in the eco portfolio have passed an external review process\ufffd During the year, as our focus was mainly on revising the eco portfolio criteria to align with the upcoming EU Taxonomy regulation, no new

contribute to at least two of the environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy: the climate change mitigation and the transition to a circular economy\ufffd To support the EU Taxonomy alignment, the eco portfolio is primarily being revised into two categories: climate solutions and circular solutions\ufffd The climate solutions contribute to signi/ficant emission reductions, aligned with the 1\ufffd5C climate ambition, whereas the circular solutions are considered contributing to the transition to a circular economy\ufffd\n\nDuring 2021, Cargotec's EU Taxonomy alignment work was initialised by revising the eco portfolio criteria for the climate solution category\ufffd The target for 2022 is to enable taxonomy-aligned reporting by /finalising the development of the eco

Cargotec Corporation ('Company') has implemented its Remuneration Policy in 2021\ufffd This report includes information concerning remuneration of the Board of Directors ('Board') and the CEO of Cargotec between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021\ufffd The Report is based on the Recommendations on Corporate Governance Code 2020  in Finland as well as the provisions to the Finnish Securities Market Act and Limited Liability Companies Act\ufffd\n\nThe Report has been reviewed by the Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee ('Committee') and approved by the Board of Directors\ufffd The shareholders will make an advisory decision on the approval of the Remuneration Report at the Company's Annual General Meeting 2022\ufffd\n\n## Letter from the Chairman of the Board\n\nRemuneration of the Cargotec governing bodies is based on the Remuneration Policy that was presented for an advisory decision at the Annual General Meeting held on 27th May 2020\ufffd Cargotec has followed the Remuneration Policy's decision making process and remuneration governance model in 2021\ufffd There haven't been any claw-backs made in 2021\ufffd Our Remuneration Policy and overall remuneration philosophy reinforces Cargotec's values and ethical principles as well as aligns remuneration with the successful delivery of our strategy and creating long-term shareholder value\ufffd The variable, performance-based incentives - short- and long-term incentive programmes (STI and LTI programmes) - are designed to be the largest component of remuneration, thereby strengthening the alignment between remuneration and company performance, and re/flecting our philosophy that CEO remuneration should be closely tied to the strategy aimed at long-term value creation\ufffd Performance measures for the variable pay programmes are determined annually by the Board and they re/flect our key performance indicators\ufffd\n\nSustainability has been one of Cargotec's guiding principles ever since the company was founded\ufffd Our determined efforts to promote sustainability continued in 2021, when we named sustainability and pro/fitable growth as our strategic breakthrough objectives\ufffd In concrete terms, Cargotec aims to reduce the CO 2 emissions of its value chain by 1 million tons by 2024\ufffd Items that promote sustainability are also included in the Cargotec's CEO's annual incentive and remuneration arrangement\ufffd\n\nThanks to active and innovative product development efforts, our business areas can now offer electric products in all their product categories\ufffd I am pleased that we in this way can contribute to carbon footprint reduction in our industry and provide advanced and ecoef/ficient cargo and load handling products and solutions for our customers\ufffd\n\nIn 2021, the improving market situation and increasing economic activity boosted our orders received to a record level\ufffd However, as the year progressed, component shortages and global logistics challenges proved to be more dif/ficult than what we had estimated, causing delays to our deliveries\ufffd Orders received increased by 42 percent compared to the comparison period whereas, despite the strong demand, our sales increased by only 2 percent due to lower project deliveries in Kalmar and MacGregor as well as the sale of the Navis business\ufffd\n\nCargotec's service business reached a new record when services sales increased by 7 percent and services orders received by 18 percent compared to the previous year\ufffd The customer interest towards eco-ef/ficient equipment is increasing\ufffd As an example, more than a quarter of the forklift truck orders in 2021 were fully electric\ufffd\n\nDuring the year Cargotec progressed in several important strategic activities\ufffd In September, we signed an agreement with SSAB to work on the introduction of fossil-free steel to the cargo handling industry, and completed the sale of the Navis business, which had an approximately EUR 230 million positive impact on Cargotec's operating pro/fit\ufffd The proceeds enable R&D investments in the /fields of electri/fication, digitalisation, robotisation and automation, and further investments in acquisitions\ufffd\n\n- On 1 October 2020, Cargotec Corporation and Konecranes Plc announced their combination agreement and a merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger\ufffd Extraordinary general meetings of Cargotec and Konecranes held on 18 December 2020 approved the merger\ufffd Competition authorities in the EU, UK, and US, among others, are reviewing the proposed transaction\ufffd To ensure a successful execution of the merger, Cargotec's business performance and shareholder value creation, the Cargotec CEO participates in the retention and incentive programmes\ufffd\n\nCargotec and Konecranes continue to actively cooperate with the competition authorities with the aim to mitigate some of these concerns raised by some competition authorities\ufffd The remaining approvals are expected to be received to allow completion of the transaction by the end of H1/2022\ufffd Until then, both companies will operate fully separately and independently\ufffd In my view the merger plan between Cargotec and Konecranes provides excellent value creation opportunities\ufffd The Future Company will eventually be a forerunner in promoting sustainable freight transport throughout our industry\ufffd\n\n## Ilkka Herlin\n\nChairman of the Board and Board's Nomination and Compensation Committee\n\n## Cargotec 2021 Remuneration

meeting\ufffd The results of the scenario analysis have directly in/fluenced the strategy, with the commitment to be a 1\ufffd5\u00b0C company being visible evidence\ufffd\n\n## Risk management\n\nCargotec has two processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities\ufffd First, the general corporate risk management process (e\ufffdg\ufffd Enterprise Risk Management, Business Continuity Planning) and second, a dedicated specialised climate-related risk management process\ufffd Due to the long time horizon of climate-related impacts and broadness of risk assessments in corporate processes, Cargotec does not consider the corporate process to be fully suf/ficient to capture all material climate risks\ufffd\n\nIn the corporate risk management process, climate-related risks are assessed using the general approach of the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)\ufffd The ERM process includes both the assessment and management of various broad-based business risks (e\ufffdg\ufffd market, competitor, /financial etc)\ufffd Risks are identi/fied and discussed at business area and corporate levels\ufffd At corporate level, risks informed by business areas are consolidated together with relevant corporate-wide risks\ufffd\n\nCargotec also conducts Business Continuity Planning where, together with the insurer, a set of approximately 5 facilities (mainly assembly sites) are evaluated on an annual basis, based on prioritisation and risk level\ufffd Assessments include matters such as supply chain risk,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nproperty damage, and natural hazards\ufffd Business areas also have integrated management systems in place, including quality, health & safety, and environmental management systems\ufffd All of those include risk assessments on an asset level, including potential shortterm impacts of climate change at the location\ufffd\n\nTo complement the general corporate risk management process, corporate sustainability and strategy teams have created a speci/fic climate-related risk management process\ufffd This process addresses climate-related opportunities besides the risks, and also makes a dedicated space for the climate-related matters separate from other business risks and opportunities\ufffd While the ERM process focuses on direct operations, this speci/fic climate-related risk management process considers the full value chain\ufffd\n\nThe preliminary, high-level climate-related risks and opportunities identi/fication, assessment and response has been conducted by the corporate teams\ufffd Thereafter, the business areas are responsible for validating the outcome and also taking the process to a more detailed level as seen necessary\ufffd This speci/fic climate-related risk management process is conducted as a part of the strategy process to ensure that a long-term time horizon is properly considered and suf/ficient actions are taken in that respect\ufffd\n\nSeveral risk types are considered in the climate-related risk management process\ufffd Current regulations, affecting both own and customers' operations, are always considered\ufffd Energy and emissions related regulation can in/fluence raw material availability and prices, and are therefore considered in the risk assessment\ufffd As an example, products must comply with noise and other pollution-related regulations that affect customers' operations\ufffd Emerging regulation is seen as a business driver\ufffd The transition to a low-carbon economy will come with new regulations that can have signi/ficant business impact, such as zero emission vehicles and shipping-related regulation\ufffd\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnology-related risks are also seen as central since Cargotec's low-carbon solutions are developed based on new and emerging technology\ufffd Electri/fication, automation and digitalisation play a key role in Cargotec's strategy, and they are all very dependent on technological improvements and seen as the main measure to improve ef/ficiency and reduce emissions\ufffd Market-related risks are always considered as the demand of products and services is dependent on the surrounding conditions\ufffd For example, depending on the political conditions de/fining the market situation, the driver of a customer decision can be costs or emissions\ufffd This can impact the overall demand for eco-ef/ficient low-carbon solutions\ufffd A high demand for low emission products might also impact the availability and price of certain materials and components which are crucial in the making of new low emission technologies\ufffd Reputation is seen to become increasingly important as customers and consumers have higher expectations towards the sustainability of the cargo handling industry\ufffd Reputation is also considered important in terms of attracting talent\ufffd\n\nAcute and chronic physical risks are also deemed relevant\ufffd Extreme weather events are especially relevant for such suppliers that are located in high risk areas\ufffd Of the chronic risks, sea level rise and increasing temperatures set new requirements for products as they may cause the operating conditions to become more challenging\ufffd Extreme working conditions also increase risks related to health and safety\ufffd\n\nDuring acquisition and divestment cases, Cargotec conducts an environmental due diligence process to ensure that potential environmental risks are accounted for\ufffd\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nFollowing Cargotec's commitment to 1\ufffd5\u00b0C climate ambition, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are set in line with the latest climate science\ufffd The target,

turnover of EUR 1,644 (1,369) million\ufffd In addition, according to Fidessa, a total of 59 (55) million class B shares were traded in several alternative marketplaces, such as Cboe BXE and Cboe APA, corresponding to a turnover of EUR 2,640 (1,441) million\ufffd\n\n## Loans, liabilities and commitments to related parties\n\nIn 2020, Cargotec extended a retention incentive programme to the CEO for the transition period prior to completion of the merger between Cargotec and Konecranes and creation of the combined company to ensure Cargotec's business performance, successful execution of the merger, and shareholder value creation in 2021\ufffd The value of the retention programme is EUR 1,500,000, and the payment under the programme will be paid as a one-off payment to the CEO's supplemental pension plan under the new pension agreement after the completion of the merger\ufffd The payment is subject to the following preconditions: the merger is completed, the CEO continues in the service of the company, he has not served a notice of termination prior to the completion of the merger, and has performed his duties according to his contract\ufffd The capital redemption policy related to the retention incentive programme has been pledged to the director as security for the pension agreement promise, creating a liability of EUR 1\ufffd5 million for Cargotec\ufffd\n\n## Board of Directors and CEO\n\nCargotec's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders decides on the election of the members of the Board of Directors, the auditor and their remunerations, as well as changes on the Articles of Association\ufffd The Board of Directors elects Cargotec's CEO and determines the terms of his/her employment\ufffd\n\n## Short-term risks and uncertainties\n\nDevelopments in the global economy and cargo /flows have a direct effect on Cargotec's operating environment and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncustomers' willingness to invest\ufffd Possible changes in the global economy and supply chains, geopolitical tensions, sanctions and trade wars can have an impact on global /flow of goods and therefore on the demand of Cargotec's solutions\ufffd\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic can still have direct and indirect impacts on Cargotec's business\ufffd In some areas, safety measures and travel restrictions may limit Cargotec's business prerequisites, as well as selling, operating and delivering Cargotec's solutions\ufffd Ensuring a safe working environment for Cargotec personnel may still be challenging while, as a result of the pandemic, the risk of illness among personnel has increased\ufffd\n\nThe ongoing strong economic growth has pushed up the prices for transportation, components, energy and materials, and caused shortages of them\ufffd If the situation persists, elevated price levels, component shortages, challenges in electricity distribution, as well as disruptions in the logistics chain may increase inventories, weaken cash /flow, cause delays to deliveries, and create additional costs which cannot be fully passed on to customer prices\ufffd Furthermore, announced stimulus programmes can turn interest rates and in/flation upwards\ufffd Due to the size of these programmes, price and in/flationary effects may be signi/ficant in the future\ufffd The turnover, availability and cost of skilled personnel can create disturbances to Cargotec and its supplier operations\ufffd\n\nA slowdown or contraction in global economic growth may in the longer term lower the container traf/fic growth rate, which affects demand and deliveries for Kalmar's cargo handling solutions\ufffd Project executions face risks related to schedule, cost and delivery guarantees\ufffd\n\nHiab's demand is impacted by the development of the construction market\ufffd A signi/ficant share of Hiab's orders are from the United States\ufffd Even though the cash /flows are hedged for the existing order book, the weakening of the US dollar could in the longer term weaken Hiab's results\ufffd\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimilarly, a stronger dollar could strengthen Hiab's results\ufffd As the Hiab solutions are installed on trucks, the truck delivery bottlenecks can have a negative impact on Hiab's sales development\ufffd\n\nMacGregor's market situation still involves uncertainties, even though demand in the merchant ship market picked up during the year 2021\ufffd The increases in the new vessel construction costs as well as the high amounts of order bookings at shipyards may slow down new vessel orders\ufffd In the short term, the tightening emission regulation for ships and related uncertainty may limit new investments\ufffd Global decarbonisation targets have led to a fall in investments by the oil industry, which has long been re/flected in decreased offshore vessel investments\ufffd However, increase in contracting for wind turbine installations and service vessels is estimated to partly compensate that in the future\ufffd Project executions face risks related to schedule, cost and delivery guarantees, especially those related to new product developments\ufffd Downward revision of market estimates or rising interest rates could result in an impairment of MacGregor's goodwill\ufffd\n\nIn a changing market situation, customers may also try to postpone or cancel orders\ufffd Deterioration of the global economic outlook and access to /finance can lead to economic and /financial dif/ficulties among customers\ufffd In some cases their /financial position may deteriorate signi/ficantly or even lead to insolvency\ufffd\n\nCargotec is involved in certain legal disputes and trials\ufffd The interpretation of international agreements and legislation may weaken the predictability of the end results of legal disputes and trials\ufffd\n\nRisks regarding Cargotec's acquisitions are related to, for example, the knowledge of the local markets, authority processes, customers, corporate culture, integration, costs, achieving targets as well as key employees\ufffd",

terms, the risks and rewards are considered to be transferred either in accordance with the applied delivery term, when the installation of the product is ready, or when the customer accepts the product\ufffd\n\nIf a customer contract is expected to be loss-making, the costs arising from the contract are estimated with the same principles that are applied to provisions and the expected loss is recognised immediately in the statement of income\ufffd\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment that are either manufactured in large quantities or their manufacturing requires no signi/ficant amount of design work is recognised at a point in time when signi/ficant risks and rewards related to the product have been transferred to the buyer and the company no longer has the authority or control over the product\ufffd When products are sold without delivery or installation, revenue is recognised when the product is handed over or otherwise made available to the customer\ufffd If standard products are sold with delivery but without installation, the timing of revenue recognition is stipulated by the applied delivery clause (Incoterm)\ufffd If standard products are sold together with an installation service, the timing of revenue recognition is determined based on the complexity of the installation work\ufffd Complex installation services are considered to be performance obligations closely related to the installed products, and, therefore, the revenue from both is recognised only after the installation is completed\ufffd On the contrary, the non-complex installation services that are typically of short duration and low in value do not determine the timing of the product's revenue recognition\ufffd\n\nRevenue from sales of machines and equipment, the manufacturing of which requires a signi/ficant amount of design work, is recognised over time by using the percentage of completion method if it is assessed that the product is not suitable as such or with minor modi/fications for another customer, and if Cargotec has a contractual right to a payment regarding the produced output\ufffd Due to this two-tier rule, the timing of the revenue recognition of these products is in practice determined by the payment terms of the contract\ufffd The percentage of completion is determined either by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by completion of a certain physical milestone (milestone method)\ufffd If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered\ufffd\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image

time if the customer obtains a perpetual right to use it as it exists at the point in time at which the licence is granted\ufffd If the software sold with perpetual licence requires signi/ficant customer-speci/fic customisation, the software licence and the customisation work are considered to be a combined performance obligation, and the related revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on the amount of work performed\ufffd If it is not possible to reliably estimate the outcome of a contract, costs are recognised as incurred and revenues only to an extent the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered\ufffd If a software licence is sold for a de/fined period of time, or as a service, the related revenue is recognised over the licence or service period\ufffd\n\nRevenue from sales related to service contracts is recognised in accordance with the percentage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated\ufffd The stage of completion is determined by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs (cost-to-cost method) or by reference to the amount of service work performed from the expected total amount of service work to be performed (milestone method)\ufffd The percentage of completion related to long-term and small-value service contracts is not assessed at an individual contract level based on the costs incurred or amount of work performed, but it is based on an estimate of how the costs are generally incurred and services performed over a contract period with a similar length\ufffd If the service is continuous or includes an inde/finite number of deliverables, such as software maintenance and support services, cloud-based data services and extended warranties, the revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis over the contract period\ufffd If the outcome of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, the project costs are recognised in the statement of income during the period in which they are incurred and the revenue only to the extent that the corresponding costs are expected to be recovered\ufffd Expected contract losses are recognised as expenses immediately\ufffd Revenue from short-term service orders is recognised when the service has been rendered\ufffd\n\nCargotec offers customer /finance services to certain customer segments and distribution channels\ufffd In these transactions, Cargotec is involved in arranging /financing to the customer or dealer either directly by itself or in cooperation with a /financing partner\ufffd It is typical that in these arrangements Cargotec continues to carry some level of residual value risk related to the sold product or credit risk related to the end customer\ufffd Depending on the type and level of risk retained, Cargotec accounts for its sales under customer /finance arrangements as normal sales, operating or /finance leases, or

MacGregor's restructuring costs in 2020 relate mainly to the integration of the marine- and offshore businesses of TTS Group ASA, acquired in the end of July 2019, and winding down certain products in MacGregor's offshore product portfolio due to offshore market's fundamental transition from the traditional oil and gas centric business towards more renewable energy sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->",

progress of vaccination programmes and a strong recovery in demand, which led to global economic growth reaching its highest level in decades\ufffd The outlook was further enhanced by massive /fiscal stimulus programs, largely targeting energy and infrastructure projects\ufffd Economic growth and investment were re/flected in strong demand for Cargotec's equipment solutions and service offering in 2021\ufffd\n\nThe economic outlook has been overshadowed by rapid changes in the pandemic situation, economic instability in many sectors and uncertainty about the continuity of economic growth\ufffd The strong economic recovery has pushed up prices of both materials and transport, and caused shortages of them\ufffd\n\nFor Cargotec, the shortages of components and prolonged disruptions in the logistics chain, sharp price increases, and problems with electricity distribution have led to increased inventories, reduced cash /flow, delayed deliveries, and generated additional costs that cannot be fully passed on to customer prices\ufffd\n\nIf continued, strong economic growth and rising prices could lead to larger and earlier investments in companies, strengthening the economic cycle and increasing risks as the economy recovers or /financing tightens\ufffd Due to their size, announced /fiscal stimulus programmes may also have an upward effect on in/flation\ufffd On the other hand, central banks' actions against accelerating in/flation will also increase uncertainty, as the expected changes to the ongoing monetary stimulus programmes could lead to a sharp rise in market interest rates\ufffd\n\nAn increase in interest rates would increase Cargotec's /financing costs, reduce the value of items measured at present value and thus also increase the risk of impairment of MacGregor's goodwill\ufffd Short-term risks for Cargotec also include credit losses related to customer receivables\ufffd Bankruptcies have decreased during the pandemic due to temporary changes in bankruptcy laws but as these end and monetary stimulus is decreased, credit losses may increase\ufffd There was no material increase in Cargotec's realised credit losses in 2021\ufffd The credit loss allowance related to trade receivables was EUR 18 (December 31, 2020: 19) million at the time of review\ufffd\n\nCargotec seeks to take uncertainties into account in its decision-making and to re/flect these uncertainties in its /financial reporting through management's estimates and judgments applied, the effect of which is emphasised in the current operating environment\ufffd",

stages\ufffd Cost accrual enables the margin recognised from the project to be kept from one stage of completion to another at the level of the expected project margin\ufffd\n\nPrepayments from customer /finance agreements include received prepayments in which the residual value of the sold equipment has not been substantially transferred to the customer and, as a result, the agreement is treated as an operating lease\ufffd\n\n| MEUR                                                               | Note   | 31 Dec 2021   | 31 Dec 2020

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements comprise the /financial statements of Cargotec's parent company and its subsidiaries in which the parent exercises control\ufffd Control is achieved when Cargotec is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee\ufffd Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control\ufffd When less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee are held, all relevant facts and circumstances are considered in assessing whether Cargotec has control over an investee\ufffd Cargotec reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes in the relevant elements of control\ufffd Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when Cargotec obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the control is lost\ufffd Assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary\ufffd\n\nPro/fit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a de/ficit balance\ufffd When necessary, adjustments are made to the /financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies\ufffd All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses, and cash /flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated on consolidation\ufffd A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction\ufffd In acquiring non-controlling interests' shares in subsidiaries, the difference between any consideration paid and the share of net assets acquired in the subsidiary is recorded in equity\ufffd Gains and losses realised on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity\ufffd\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method\ufffd The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interest issued by the group\ufffd The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement\ufffd If contingent consideration is classi/fied as a /financial liability, it is measured at fair value on each reporting date, and the changes in the fair value are recognised in the statement of income\ufffd Contingent consideration classi/fied as equity is not revalued\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdenti/fiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their acquisition date fair values\ufffd The share of non-controlling interest in the acquiree is recognised on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets\ufffd The difference, if any, between the consideration transferred and the fair value of net assets obtained is recognised as goodwill\ufffd Subsidiaries acquired during the /financial period are included in the consolidated /financial statements from the date the control is obtained, and divested subsidiaries until the date the control is lost\ufffd When control is lost, all assets and liabilities related to the disposed subsidiary are derecognised\ufffd Additionally, if relevant, the hedging result recognised in other comprehensive income by the disposed subsidiary and the translation differences related to the disposed subsidiary are reclassi/fied to statement of income\ufffd\n\nIf a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is revalued at fair value at the acquisition date\ufffd Any gains or losses arising from remeasurement are recognised in the statement of income\ufffd Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred\ufffd Transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are treated as equity transactions\ufffd In acquiring non-controlling interests' shares in subsidiaries, the difference between any consideration paid and the share of net assets acquired in the subsidiary is recorded in equity\ufffd Gains and losses realised on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity\ufffd Distribution of net income for the period to the equity holders of the parent company and to non-controlling interests is presented in the statement of income\ufffd Equity attributable to non-controlling interest is disclosed as a separate item on the balance sheet\ufffd\n\nAll intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities, unrealised pro/fits and distribution of pro/fits within Cargotec are eliminated in the consolidated /financial statements\ufffd The accounting principles of the subsidiaries have been changed, where necessary, to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec Corporation\ufffd\n\nInvestments in joint ventures in which Cargotec exercises joint control and has a right to net assets purely based on the ownership interest held, and associated companies over which Cargotec exercises signi/ficant in/fluence, but has no control, are accounted for in the consolidated /financial statements under the equity method\ufffd Investments in joint ventures and associated companies are initially recognised on the balance sheet at the acquisition cost, which includes goodwill and intangible assets identi/fied on acquisition as well as the costs for acquiring or establishing the joint venture or associated company\ufffd Subsequently, the value of investment is adjusted in accordance with changes in the net assets of the investee in proportion to Cargotec's ownership, and in accordance with the amortisations of the intangible assets identi/fied in the acquisition\ufffd

investee\ufffd\n\nCargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's pro/fit for the /financial period is presented as a separate item before the operating result in the consolidated statement of income\ufffd The results of joint ventures and associated companies are accounted for with equity method based on their most recent /financial statements\ufffd The carrying amount of investments in joint ventures and associated companies is reviewed on a regular basis and if any impairment in value has occurred, it is written down in the period in which these circumstances are identi/fied\ufffd If Cargotec's share of the joint venture's or associated company's losses exceeds its interest in the company, the carrying amount is written down to zero\ufffd After this, losses are reported only if Cargotec is committed to ful/filling the obligations of the joint venture or associated company\ufffd\n\nBusiness transactions between the group and the joint ventures or associated companies are recognised in the group's /financial statements only to the extent of the unrelated investor's interest in the joint venture or associated company\ufffd Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred assets\ufffd The accounting principles of the joint ventures and associated companies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the principles adopted by Cargotec Corporation\ufffd\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction\ufffd Open foreign currency-denominated monetary receivables and liabilities at the end of the /financial period, both intercompany and external, are translated using the exchange rate of the balance sheet date, and the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of income except when hedge accounting is applied\ufffd Foreign exchange gains and losses related to normal business operations are treated as adjustments to sales or costs\ufffd Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses\ufffd\n\nExchange rate gains and losses related to foreign currency hedges designated as hedges of sales and purchases under hedge accounting are /first recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, and /finally in the statement of income as adjustments to sales and purchases simultaneously with the related transactions\ufffd Exchange rate differences on other hedges relating to business operations are recorded in other operating income and expenses\ufffd Foreign exchange gains and losses associated with /financing are included in /financial income and expenses\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe stand-alone /financial statements of subsidiaries are reported using the currency that best re/flects the operational environment of that subsidiary ('the functional currency')\ufffd In the consolidated /financial statements, the statement of income and the cash /flows of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the euro are translated into euros using the average exchange rate of the /financial period, and the assets and liabilities on the balance sheets are translated into euros at the balance sheet date exchange rate\ufffd Translation differences caused by different exchange rates are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the cumulative translation differences in equity\ufffd Intercompany loan agreements may form a part of net investment if their settlement is neither planned nor probable in the foreseeable future, and thus the exchange rate gains and losses of these contracts are also recognised as translation differences in equity\ufffd When applying hedge accounting for a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange rate differences on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of income\ufffd\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate\ufffd Translation differences arising are recognised in equity\ufffd\n\nTranslation differences from acquisition cost eliminations and post-acquisition pro/fits and losses of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures outside the euro area are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income\ufffd When a foreign entity or part of it is disposed, accumulated translation differences previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassi/fied to the statement of income as a part of the gain or loss on sale\ufffd\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets are classi/fied as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction instead of normal use and a sale is considered highly probable\ufffd Non-current assets held for sale are measured immediately before reclassi/fication in accordance with the normal measurement principles after which they are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell\ufffd Impairment losses or gains are recognised in the statement of income\ufffd Non-current assets held for sale are not depreciated or amortised\ufffd",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Accounting principle\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classi/fied in accordance with the applied measurement principle as /financial assets at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through pro/fit or loss\ufffd Financial assets are classi/fied at the initial recognition in accordance with the features and planned use of the asset\ufffd Financial assets are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year\ufffd\n\nFinancial assets are measured at amortised cost if there is no intention to sell the asset and the expected contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of the principal amount\ufffd The loans and receivables measured at amortised cost mostly consist of accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents\ufffd Loan receivables are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at amortised cost in accordance with the effective interest method\ufffd Changes in the amount of expected credit loss are re/flected in the expected cash /flows included in amortised cost\ufffd\n\nFinancial assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if the asset can be sold before it matures and the contractual cash /flow from it is based on interest and repayment of principal\ufffd The /financial assets included in the class are measured initially at fair value plus transaction costs and less expected credit losses, and subsequently at fair value less expected credit losses\ufffd Equity instruments can be irrevocably classi/fied into this category on initial recognition after which all subsequent fair value changes are recognised in other comprehensive income except dividends that are recognised in the statement of income\ufffd In addition, the effective portion of fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting is measured in accordance with this category throughout the hedge relationship\ufffd\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are those /financial assets that do not belong to the previous classes, including equity investments, derivative instruments to which no hedge accounting is applied, and /financial assets held for trading, or from which the expected contractual cash /flows on initial recognition are not solely based on interest and repayment of principal\ufffd The transaction costs and\n\n<!-- image -->",

directly in the statement of income\ufffd\n\nPurchases and sales of derivative instruments are recognised on the trade date, while transactions in the other /financial asset categories are recognised on the settlement date\ufffd\n\n- A /financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash /flows from the asset expire or are transferred so that the material risks and rewards related to the ownership of the asset are transferred to another party\ufffd\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, short-term bank deposits and other short-term liquid investments with maturities up to three months\ufffd Bank overdrafts are included in other current liabilities\ufffd In the statement of cash /flows, bank overdrafts are deducted from cash and cash equivalents\ufffd\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied as /financial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss and as /financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost\ufffd Financial liabilities are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year\ufffd\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss include derivative instruments unless hedge accounting is applied\ufffd The transaction costs and subsequent fair value changes of /financial liabilities recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss are recognised directly in the statement of income\ufffd Fair value changes related to derivatives under hedge accounting are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and, subsequently, recycled to the statement of income when hedge accounting is ceased\ufffd\n\nFinancial liabilities recognised at amortised cost include mainly interest-bearing liabilities and accounts payable\ufffd Financial liabilities recognised at amortised cost are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently, at amortised cost using the effective interest method\ufffd\n\nBought and sold derivative instruments are recognised on the trade date while transactions with the other /financial liabilities are recognised on the settlement date\ufffd\n\nA /financial liability is derecognised when the related obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires\ufffd When an existing /financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsubstantially modi/fied, such an exchange or modi/fication is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability\ufffd The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of income\ufffd\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and /financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported on the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously\ufffd\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nCargotec uses mainly currency forwards, and cross-currency and interest rate swaps to hedge from the identi/fied signi/ficant market risks\ufffd Derivative instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which equals the fair value, and are subsequently measured at fair value on each balance sheet date\ufffd Derivatives are classi/fied at the inception either as hedges of binding agreements and future cash /flows, in which case cash /flow hedge accounting is applied to them, or as derivatives at fair value through pro/fit or loss, when the preconditions for hedge accounting are not fully met\ufffd\n\nFair values of foreign currency forward contracts are based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date\ufffd The fair values of cross-currency and interest rate swaps are calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows\ufffd Derivative instruments are presented as non-current when their maturity exceeds one year\ufffd\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is mainly applied to hedges of operative cash /flows\ufffd In addition, hedge accounting is applied to hedges of certain foreign currency denominated borrowings\ufffd To qualify for hedge accounting, the company documents the hedge relationship of the derivative instruments and the underlying items, group's risk management targets and the strategy of applying hedge accounting\ufffd When starting hedge accounting and at least in every interim and annual closing, the company documents and estimates the effectiveness of the hedge by measuring the ability of the hedging instrument to offset changes in fair value of the underlying cash /flow\ufffd Because the critical terms of the hedging instrument are set to match with the hedged item as closely as possible, there is typically no inef/ficiency\ufffd\n\nFair value changes of hedging instruments under effective cash /flow hedge relationship are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income in the fair value reserve of equity, and under effective net investment hedges through the statement of comprehensive income in the translation differences of equity\ufffd However, only the",

risk management are conducted according to the Treasury Policy, approved by the Board of Directors\ufffd Organisation, responsibilities and principles of /financial risk management, monitoring and reporting are de/fined in the Treasury Policy\ufffd Treasury Committee, appointed by the Board, is responsible for Treasury Policy compliance and for organising and monitoring the treasury function\ufffd Detailed guidelines for /financing functions in accordance with Treasury Policy are de/fined in Treasury Instructions, approved by the Treasury Committee\ufffd\n\nThe objectives of the treasury function are to secure suf/ficient funding for business operations, avoiding /financial constraint at all times, to provide business units with /financial services, to minimise the costs of /financing, to manage /financial risks (currency, interest rate, liquidity and funding, credit, counterparty and operational risks) and to regularly provide management with information on the /financial position and risk exposures of Cargotec and its business units\ufffd\n\nCargotec Treasury is responsible for funding at corporate level, for managing liquidity and /financial risks, for providing ef/ficient set up of /financing operations and for monitoring business unit /financial positions\ufffd Cargotec Treasury reports on these issues monthly\ufffd The business units are responsible for hedging their /financial risks according to the Treasury Policy and instructions from Cargotec Treasury\ufffd\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCargotec operates in more than 100 countries and is, due to its global operations, exposed to risks arising from foreign exchange rate /fluctuations\ufffd A signi/ficant proportion of Cargotec sales and costs are generated in foreign currencies, mostly in US dollars and Swedish krona\ufffd\n\nThe objective of the currency risk management is to hedge operations against exchange rate /fluctuations, thus allowing time for the business units to react and adapt to changes in exchange rates\ufffd Foreign currency positions, which include contractual cash /flows, related to sales, purchases and /financing, are fully hedged\ufffd Other highly probable cash /flows may be hedged, if deemed necessary by Cargotec Treasury and the business unit\ufffd The business units report their risk exposures to Cargotec Treasury and hedge the positions via intercompany forward contracts\ufffd In countries where hedging is restricted, foreign currency denominated loans and deposits may be used as hedging instruments\ufffd\n\nCash /flow hedge accounting is generally applied to qualifying foreign currency hedges\ufffd Under the Cargotec hedge accounting model, the portion of the fair value change related to a change in the spot rate is recognised in the fair value reserve within equity until the cumulative pro/fit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nor loss is recycled to the statement of income simultaneously with the hedged item\ufffd The portion of the fair value change related to interest rate is excluded from hedge accounting and recognised directly in pro/fit or loss\ufffd Hedge accounting is started when a qualifying risk exposure is identi/fied and Cargotec enters into a hedge, and terminated when the hedged item impacts pro/fit or loss\ufffd Hedge accounting is not applied in cases where its impact on the consolidated statement of income is deemed insigni/ficant by Cargotec Treasury\ufffd\n\nCargotec is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from both on- and off-balance sheet items\ufffd The net balance sheet exposure in the table below represents the foreign currency risk arising from the on-balance sheet /financial items, and the net exposure

Ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement\ufffd Cumulative gain or loss on the hedge deferred to equity is recognised in the income statement as an adjustment to the hedged item during the same period when the hedged item is recognised\ufffd Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments relating to operative items that no longer are expected to materialise are recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating income/expenses\ufffd If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, the contract is revoked or exercised or the relation of the hedging instrument and the underlying item is revoked, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the underlying operative item materialises\ufffd\n\nChanges in the fair values of hedges, for which hedge accounting is not applied, are recognised in the income statement, either in operative income and expenses or /financial income and expenses, depending on the hedged item\ufffd Changes in all forward contract fair values due to interest rate changes are always directly recognised in /financial income and expenses\ufffd\n\n## Equity\n\nEquity consists of share capital, share premium account, fair value reserves, reserve for invested non-restricted equity and retained earnings, deducted with dividends paid and donations approved at the Annual General Meeting\ufffd The amount exceeding the accounting par value of shares received by the company in connection with share subscriptions was recorded in share premium account under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sep 1978/734)\ufffd Fair value reserves include the cumulative spot-component of the changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments de/fined as cash /flow hedges\ufffd Under the new (1 Sep 2006) Limited Liability Companies Act (21 Jul 2006/624), when stock options are exercised, the amount received is recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity\ufffd Changes in treasury shares are recorded in reserve for invested non-restricted equity\ufffd The net pro/fit/loss for the period is recorded in retained earnings\ufffd\n\n## Statutory provisions\n\nStatutory provisions are expenses to which the parent company is committed and that are not likely to generate the corresponding revenue, or losses, which are regarded as evident\ufffd\n\n## 2\ufffd Financial risk management\n\nThe parent company manages the /financial risks of the group and operates under the same policies and instructions as the group\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe parent company's treasury function operates as an internal bank for the group's subsidiaries\ufffd The parent company's currency exposure originates mainly from foreign currency funding given to subsidiaries and foreign currency loans taken by the parent company\ufffd In addition, the currency position includes internal forward agreements with the subsidiaries and external forward agreements\ufffd Foreign exchange differences arising from these transactions are booked in the statement of income in the /financial items\ufffd Furthermore, the parent company invoices the group companies for the services provided\ufffd Foreign exchange differences from these invoices are booked in the parent company's operational pro/fit\ufffd\n\nThe parent company's open currency exposure on 31 December 2021 was, in absolute terms, EUR 7\ufffd5 (31 Dec 2020: 10\ufffd7) million\ufffd\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe parent company's interest rate risk originates from external loans and internal loans and deposits\ufffd The pricing of intercompany transactions is based on transfer pricing rules, and internal interest income and expenses are eliminated on group level\ufffd As a result, interest rate risk is not measured separately on parent company level, and the information presented in the consolidated /financial statements regarding interest risk and its management is the same for the parent company\ufffd\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nThe majority of the group's derivatives, loans and cash equivalents belong to the parent company\ufffd The maturity structure of these /financial liabilities is not separately followed on parent company level, because the information presented in the consolidated /financial statements provides a fair view of the liquidity and funding risk\ufffd Only account payables and account receivables vary signi/ficantly between the parent company and the group\ufffd\n\n## Credit and counterparty risk\n\nThe parent company's accounts receivable and loan receivables originate mainly from the other group companies, and the parent company is therefore not exposed to a counterparty risk\ufffd\n\nExternal loan receivables on 31 December 2021 were EUR 10\ufffd1 (31 Dec 2020: 7\ufffd1) million, and cash and equivalents EUR 286\ufffd1 (31 Dec 2020: 361\ufffd8) million\ufffd The parent company's cash and equivalents are held in banks that have a solid credit rating and are approved by the Treasury Committee\ufffd More information about the credit risk related to derivatives is disclosed in the note 8\ufffd1 in the consolidated /financial statements\ufffd\n\n## Operational risks of the treasury function\n\nThe treasury function operates as part of the parent company, and applies the same risk management goals as the group\ufffd",

The percentage of completion is determined either by reference to the individual contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract cost or by completion of a certain physical milestone.\n\nThe Group has significant projects, where revenue is recognized over time, in the Kalmar and MacGregor segments. In year 2021, approximately 13 % percent of total sales of 3.3 billion euro was recognized on an over time basis.\n\nThe recognition of revenue and the estimation of the outcome of a project require significant management judgment, in particular with respect to estimating the stage of completion and cost to complete.\n\nThe Group makes several types of provisions related to risks associated with long-term contracts and revenue recognition over time. These provisions require high level of management judgment and are a key audit matter due to that reason.\n\nBased on above, revenue recognition over time, including project related provisions, was a key audit matter. Revenue recognition over time was also a significant risk of material misstatement referred to in EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nOur audit procedures in connection with project related provisions, and to address the risk of material misstatement in respect of the revenue recognition over time, included, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessment of the Group's accounting policies over revenue recognition over time and recognition of project related provisions;\n- \u00b7  Gaining an understanding of the revenue recognition process including related provisions;\n- \u00b7  Inspecting on a sample basis the project documentation such as contracts and other written communication;\n- \u00b7  Testing on a sample basis the percentage of completion and provision calculations as well as comparing the estimates to actuals;\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of financial development and current status by\n- \u00b7  analyzing the changes in assumptions relating to estimated revenues, costs, and related provisions and receipts of project payments, and\n- \u00b7  discussions with different levels of the organization including project level, segment and group management; and\n- \u00b7  Assessing the Group's disclosures in respect of revenue recognition and related provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\n## Valuation of goodwill\n\nThe accounting principles and disclosures relating to goodwill are included in notes 2.7 and 6.1.\n\nAt the balance sheet date December 31, 2021, the value of goodwill amounted to 966,8 million euros of which 270,5 million euros relate to Kalmar, 227,3 million euros to Hiab and 469,0 million to MacGregor.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired. Due to the current uncertainty in the financial operating environment, MacGregor's goodwill has been tested for impairment on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe annual impairment testing of goodwill was based on the management's estimate about the value-inuse of the cash generating units. There are a number of assumptions used to determine the value-in-use of the cash generating units, including revenue growth, margins and the discount rate applied on net cash-flows. The estimated value-in-use may vary significantly when underlying assumptions are changed and the changes in above-mentioned individual assumptions may result in an impairment of goodwill.\n\nThe valuation of goodwill was a key audit matter because the annual impairment testing required management judgment with respect to the key assumptions used and because of the significance of goodwill to the financial statements.\n\nValuation of goodwill related to the MacGregor segment is also a significant risk of material misstatement as defined by EU Regulation No 537/2014, point (c) of Article 10(2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HOW OUR AUDIT ADDRESSED THE KEY AUDIT MATTER\n\nOur audit procedures to address the risk of material misstatement in respect of valuation of goodwill included among others\n\n- \u00b7  Involvement of our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the key assumptions used in impairment testing by comparing management's assumptions to externally derived data and to our independently calculated industry averages, in particular those relating to\n- \u00b7  the forecasted revenue growth,\n- \u00b7  the forecasted margin and\n- \u00b7  the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the net cash-flows.\n- \u00b7  Testing of the accuracy of the impairment calculations prepared by the management and comparison of the sum of discounted cash flows against Cargotec's market capitalization.\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of the adequacy of disclosures of the impairment testing results.",

Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated /financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of /financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of /financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements\ufffd The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\ufffd\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting\ufffd The /financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so\ufffd\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion\ufffd Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists\ufffd Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the /financial

\u00b7  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion\ufffd The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control\ufffd\n- \u00b7  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\ufffd\n- \u00b7  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern\ufffd If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the /financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion\ufffd Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report\ufffd However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern\ufffd\n- \u00b7  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the /financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the /financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events so that the /financial statements give a true and fair view\ufffd\n- \u00b7  Obtain suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements\ufffd We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit\ufffd We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion\ufffd\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/ficant audit /findings, including any signi/ficant de/ficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit\ufffd\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards\ufffd\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the /financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters\ufffd We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/fits of such communication\ufffd",
