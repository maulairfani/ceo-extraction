        "page_content": "## Item 1 - Business\n\n## General\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and Canada in a manner that delivers value to all of NRG's stakeholders. NRG sells power, natural gas, and home and power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 6 million Home  customers  as  well  as  commercial,  industrial,  and  wholesale  customers,  supported  by  approximately  18,000  MW  of generation as of December 31, 2021.\n\nNRG sold 157 TWhs of electricity and 1,877 MMDth of natural gas in 2021, making it one of the largest competitive energy retailers in the U.S. As of the end of 2021, NRG had recurring electricity and/or natural gas sales in 24 U.S. states, the District  of  Columbia,  and  8  provinces  in  Canada.  NRG's  retail  brands,  collectively,  have  the  largest  share  of  competitively served residential electric customers in Texas and nationwide.\n\nThe following chart represents NRG's sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nNRG's strategy is to maximize stakeholder value through the safe production and sale of reliable electricity and natural gas to its  customers in the markets it serves, while positioning the Company to provide innovative solutions to the end-use energy or service customer. This strategy is intended to enable the Company to optimize its integrated model to generate stable and  predictable  cash  flow,  significantly  strengthen  earnings  and  cost  competitiveness,  and  lower  risk  and  volatility. Sustainability  is  a  philosophy  that  underpins  and  facilitates  value  creation  across  our  business  for  our  stakeholders.  It  is  an integral piece of NRG's strategy and ties directly to business success, reduced risks and enhanced reputation.\n\nTo effectuate the Company's strategy, NRG is focused on: (i) serving the energy needs of end-use residential, commercial and industrial, and wholesale customers in competitive markets through multiple brands and channels; (ii) offering a variety of energy products and services,  including  renewable  energy  solutions,  that  are  differentiated  by  innovative  features,  premium service, sustainability, and loyalty/affinity programs; (iii) excellence in operating performance of its assets; (iv) optimal hedging of its portfolio; and (v) engaging in disciplined and transparent capital allocation.\n\nThe 2021 fiscal year was pivotal for the Company. NRG completed the acquisition of Direct Energy, doubling the size of its  retail  portfolio,  while  further  decreasing its physical generation through the sale and planned retirement of certain assets, each as further discussed below. The completion of these significant activities positioned NRG for the next phase of its strategy focusing on growth.\n\n## PART I",

        "page_content": "The  Company implemented a four-year  plan  beginning  in  2022  to  invest  up  to  $2  billion  in  order  to  achieve  growth through optimization of the Company's core power and natural gas sales, as well as integrated solution sales within its core network in both power and home services.\n\n## Significant Acquisitions, Dispositions and Announced Retirements\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy-related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian  provinces.  The  acquisition  increased  NRG's  retail  portfolio  by  over  3  million  customers  and  complemented  its integrated  model.  It  also  broadened  the  Company's  presence  in  the  Northeast  and  in  states  and  locales  where  it  did  not previously  operate,  supporting  NRG's  objective  to  diversify  its  business.  NRG  realized  its  planned  synergy  target  of  $175 million in 2021 and expects to realize annual synergies of $225 million and $300 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. See Item  15 -Note  4, Acquisitions,  Discontinued  Operations  and  Dispositions ,  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for further discussion of the acquisition of Direct Energy.\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company sold approximately 4,850 MWs of fossil generating assets from its East and West regions of operations to Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into  a  tolling  agreement  for  the  866  MW  Arthur  Kill  plant  in  New  York  City  through  April  2025.  See  Item  15 -Note  4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year were released, leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of approximately 1,600 MW of its PJM coal generating assets in June 2022. On July 30, 2021, PJM identified reliability impacts resulting from the proposed deactivation of one of those assets, Indian River Unit 4. On August 27, 2021 the Company notified PJM that it would continue operations at Indian River Unit 4 until the reliability upgrades identified by PJM were completed, provided that the unit receives a satisfactory and compensatory  reliability  must  run  arrangement.  See  Item  15 -Note  11, Asset  Impairments, to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company is continuing to evaluate the viability of the remaining PJM generating assets.\n\n## Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021 and expected Uplift Securitization proceeds\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). Ahead of the event, NRG launched residential customer communications calling for conservation across all of its brands, and initiated  residential  and  commercial  and  industrial  demand  response  programs  to  curtail  customer  load.  The  Company maximized available generating capacity and brought in additional resources to supplement in-state staff with technical and operating experts from the rest of its U.S. fleet.\n\nThe Texas Legislature  passed  House  Bill  (\"HB\")  4492,  which  among  other  things,  authorized  ERCOT  to  obtain  $2.1 billion  of  financing  to  distribute  to  LSEs  that  were  charged  and  paid  to  ERCOT  exceptionally  highly  priced  ORDPA  and ancillary  service  costs  during  Winter  Storm  Uri  (the  \"Uplift  Securitization\").  NRG  will  receive  $689  million  from  ERCOT based on LSE-level detail published by the PUCT on December 7, 2021.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Winter Storm Uri's pre-tax financial impact to the Company was a loss of $380 million, which reflects the recovery of $689 million of cost of operations as a result of the proceeds NRG will receive from the Uplift Securitization discussed above, with receipt expected to occur during the second quarter of 2022. The Company continues  to  pursue  additional  mitigants  including,  but  not  limited  to,  customer  bad  debt  mitigation,  counterparty  default recovery, and additional ERCOT default recovery.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nThe  Company's  core  business  is  the  sale  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  residential,  commercial  and  industrial  and wholesale customers, supported by the Company's wholesale generation. NRG manages its operations based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other, which primarily includes the following assets and activities: (i) all activity related to customer, plant  and  market  operations  in  the  West  and  Canada,  (ii)  the  services  businesses,  (iii)  activity  related  to  the Cottonwood facility, (iv) the remaining renewables activity, including the Company's equity method investment in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, and (v) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.",

        "page_content": "As of December 31, 2021, in Texas, the Company's generation supply is fully integrated with its retail load. In the East, the  Company's retail  load  is  more  dispersed  throughout  the  region  and  not  fully  integrated  with  the  Company's  generation supply due to the locations of its power plants in that region. In the West/Services/Other, the Company's business is primarily serving retail load and services customers.\n\nThe Company's integrated model consists of three core functions: Customer Operations, Market Operations and Plant Operations, which directly support each other in each geographic region. The Company's integrated model in Texas provides the  advantage  of  being  able  to  supply  a  significant  portion  of  the  Company's  retail  customers  with  electricity  from  the Company's assets, which reduces the need to sell electricity to and buy electricity from other institutions and intermediaries, resulting in stable earnings and cash flows, lower transaction costs and less credit exposure. The integrated model also results in a reduction in actual and contingent collateral through offsetting transactions, thereby reducing transactions with third parties.\n\n## Customer Operations\n\nCustomer Operations is responsible for growing and retaining the customer base and delivering an outstanding customer experience. This includes acquisition and retention of all of NRG's residential, small commercial, government and commercial & industrial customers. NRG employs a multi-brand strategy that leverages a wide array of sales and partnership channels, direct face-to-face sales channels, call centers, websites, and brokers. Go-to-market activities include market strategy planning and development, product innovation, offer design, campaign execution, marketing and creative services, and selling. Customer portfolio  maintenance and retention activities  include  fulfillment,  billing,  payment  processing,  collections,  customer  service, issue resolution, and contract renewals. NRG provides energy and related services at either fixed, indexed or month-to-month prices. Home customers typically contract for terms ranging from one month to five years, while Business contracts are often between one year and five years in length. Throughout all Customer Operations activities, the customer experience is kept at the forefront to inform decision-making and optimize retention, while creating supporters and advocates for NRG's brands in the market.  Following  the  expansion  of  the  customer  base  with  the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy,  Customer  Operations  now comprises three end-use customer facing teams: NRG Home, which serves residential customers, NRG Business, which serves business customers, and NRG Services, which primarily includes the services businesses acquired.\n\n## Product Offerings\n\nNRG sells a variety of products to residential and small commercial customers, including retail electricity and energy management, natural gas, home security, line and surge protection products, HVAC installation, repair and maintenance, home protection  products,  carbon  offsets,  back-up  power  stations,  portable  power,  portable  solar  and  portable  lighting.  Home  and Services customers make purchase decisions based on a variety of factors, including price, incentive, customer service, brand, innovative  offers/features  and  referrals  from  friends  and  family.  Through  its  broad  range  of  service  offerings  and  value propositions, NRG is able to attract, retain, and increase the value of its customer relationships. NRG's brands are recognized for  exemplary  customer  service,  innovative  smart  energy  and  technology  product  offerings,  and  environmentally-friendly solutions.\n\nThe Company provides power and natural gas to the business-to-business markets in North America, as well as retail services,  including  demand  response,  commodity  sales,  energy  efficiency  and  energy  management  solutions  to  Business customers.  The  Company  is  an  integrated  provider  of  supply  and  distributed  energy  resources  and  focuses  on  distributed products and services as businesses seek greater reliability, cleaner power and other benefits that they cannot obtain from the grid.  These  solutions  include  system  power,  distributed  generation,  renewable  products,  carbon  management  and  specialty services, backup generation, storage and distributed solar, demand response, and energy efficiency and advisory services. In providing on-site energy solutions, the Company often benefits from its ability to supply energy products from its wholesale generation portfolio to Business customers.\n\n## Market Operations\n\nMarket Operations has two primary objectives: (i) to supply energy to our customers in the most cost-efficient manner; and (ii) to maximize the value of the Company's assets after satisfying its customer load requirements. These objectives are intended to reduce supply costs and maximize earnings with predictable cash flows.\n\nPower and natural gas are the two main commercial groups within market operations.\n\n## Power\n\nThe power commercial group is responsible for end-use electricity supply including power plant optimization and certain fuel supply. To meet the market operations objectives, NRG enters into supply, power and gas sales and hedging agreements via a wide range of products and contracts, including (i) physical and financial commodity instruments, (ii) fuel supply and transportation  contracts,  (iii)  renewable  PPAs  and  (iv)  capacity  and  other  contracted  revenue  sources,  as  further  discussed below.",

        "page_content": "In addition, because changes in power prices in the markets where NRG operates are generally correlated to changes in natural gas prices, NRG uses hedging strategies that may include power and natural gas forward purchases and sales contracts to manage the commodity price risk.\n\n## Physical and Financial Commodity Instruments\n\nNRG trades electric power, natural gas and related commodities, environmental products, weather products and financial products,  including  forwards,  futures,  options  and  swaps.  NRG  enters  into  these  instruments  primarily  to  manage  price  and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio, manage working capital requirements, reduce the carbon exposure in its business and comply with laws.\n\n## Fuel Supply and Transportation Contracts\n\nNRG's fuel requirements consist of various forms of fossil fuel and nuclear fuel. The prices of fossil fuels can be volatile. The  Company  obtains  its  fossil  fuels  from  multiple  suppliers  and  through  multiple  transporters.  Although  availability  is generally  not  an  issue,  localized  shortages,  transportation  availability,  delays  arising  from  extreme  weather  conditions  and supplier financial stability issues can and do occur. The preceding factors related to the sources and availability of raw materials are  fairly  uniform  across  the  Company's  business  and  fuel  products  used.  NRG's  primary  fuel  requirements  consist  of  the following:\n\nNatural Gas - NRG operates a fleet of mid-merit and peaking natural gas plants. Fuel needs are managed by the natural gas commercial group, on a spot basis, especially for peaking assets, as the Company does not believe it is prudent to forward purchase natural gas for these types of units as the dispatch is highly unpredictable.\n\nCoal -NRG actively manages its coal requirements based on forecasted generation, market volatility and its inventory on site. The Company believes it is adequately hedged, using forward coal supply agreements, for its domestic coal consumption for  2022.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  NRG  had  purchased  forward  contracts  to  provide  fuel  for  approximately  88%  of  the Company's expected requirements for 2022 and 2023. For the domestic fleet, NRG purchased approximately 16.1 million tons of  coal  in  2021,  almost  all  of  which  was  Powder  River  Basin  coal.  For  fuel  transport,  NRG  has  entered  into  various  rail transportation  and  rail  car  lease  agreements  with  varying  tenors  that  will  provide  for  most  of  the  Company's  transportation requirements of Powder River Basin coal for the next three years.\n\nNuclear  Fuel -  STP's  owners,  including  NRG,  satisfy  their  fuel  supply  requirements  by:  (i)  acquiring  uranium concentrates  and  contracting  for  conversion  of  the  uranium  concentrates  into  uranium  hexafluoride;  (ii)  contracting  for enrichment of uranium hexafluoride; and (iii) contracting for fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies. Through its proportionate participation in STPNOC, which is the NRC-licensed operator of STP that is responsible for all aspects of fuel procurement, NRG is party to a number of long-term forward purchase contracts with many of the world's largest suppliers covering STP's requirements for uranium concentrates with only approximately 25% of STP's requirements outstanding for the duration of the original operating license (through 2027/2028). Similarly, STP has begun the process of covering fuel supply requirements into the  extended  license  period  and  has  secured  a  fabrication  contract  with  Westinghouse  through  2047/2048.  Other  fuel requirements such as uranium, conversion and enrichment remain open at this time.\n\n## Renewable PPAs\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term renewable generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2021, NRG has entered into PPAs totaling approximately 2.6 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties.  The  average  tenor  of  these  agreements  is  twelve  years.  The  Company  expects  to  continue  evaluating  and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\n\n## Capacity and Other Contracted Revenue Sources\n\nNRG's  revenues  and  cash  flows,  primarily  in  the  East  and  West,  benefit  from  capacity/demand  payments  and  other contracted revenue sources, originating from market clearing capacity prices, resource adequacy contracts, tolling arrangements and other long-term contractual arrangements.\n\nThe Company's largest sources of continuing capacity revenues are capacity auctions in PJM and NYISO. PJM operates a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on real-time performance and NRG's actual revenues will  be  the  combination  of  revenues  based  on  the  cleared  auction  MW  plus  the  net  of  any  over-  and  under-performance  of NRG's respective  generation  assets.  The  Company  primarily  sells  physical  and  financial  capacity  forward  through  bilateral contracts for our New York state assets. To the extent NRG is not able to enter into physical bilateral contracts, NRG will sell the remaining capacity into the NYISO six-month strip, monthly or spot auctions.",

        "page_content": "In California, there is a resource adequacy requirement that is primarily satisfied through bilateral contracts. Such bilateral contracts  are  typically  short-term  resource  adequacy  contracts.  When  bilateral  contracting  does  not  satisfy  the  resource adequacy need, such shortfalls can be addressed through procurement tools administered by the CAISO, including the capacity procurement mechanism or reliability must-run contracts.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nThe  natural  gas  commercial  group  is  responsible  for  all  costing,  logistics  and  supply  for  all  of  NRG's  residential, commercial  &  industrial  and  wholesale  customers.  The  Direct  Energy  acquisition,  which  closed  on  January  5,  2021, significantly  increased  our  capabilities  and  scale  across  the  natural  gas  value  chain.  NRG  has  acquired  contractual  rights  to natural  gas  transportation  and  storage  assets  across  its  footprint  that  allow  for  optimal  supply  economics  in  support  of  our various  businesses.  Our  diversified  load  coupled  with  this  asset  portfolio  enables  us  to  deliver  supply  economically  while providing incremental optimization activities when market conditions allow. The scale of the natural gas operation extends from the wellhead (through our producer services business) to our end use customers (through our various sales channels). This scale, coupled with our associated assets, gas system platform and people, create significant opportunity across North America.\n\n## Plant Operations\n\nThe Company owns and leases a diversified wholesale generation portfolio with approximately 18,000 MW of fossil fuel, nuclear and renewable generation capacity at 25 plants as of December 31, 2021, including approximately 1,600 MW of its PJM coal fleet with an announced retirement date of June 2022. The Company's wholesale generation assets are diversified by fuel-type and dispatch level, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. NRG continually  evaluates  its  generation  portfolio  to  focus  on  asset  optimization  opportunities  and  the  locational  value  of  its generation assets in each of the markets where the Company participates, as well as opportunities for the development of new generation.\n\nThe following table summarizes NRG's generation portfolio as of December 31, 2021:\n\n(a)\n\n|                                                                                                         | (In MW)   | (In MW)   | (In MW)              | (In MW)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Type                                                                                                    | Texas     | East      | West/Services/ Other | Total     |\n| Natural gas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 4,775     | 1,881     | 1,494                | 8,150     |\n| Coal   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 4,174     | 3,140     | 605                  | 7,919     |\n| Oil   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -         | 455       | -                    | 455       |\n| Nuclear   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | 1,132     | -         | -                    | 1,132     |\n| Utility Scale Solar   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | -         | -         | 219                  | 219       |\n| Battery Storage   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 2         | -         | -                    | 2         |\n| Total generation capacity   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | 10,083    | 5,476     | 2,318                | 17,877    |\n\nPlant Operations is responsible for operating the Company's generation facilities at the highest standards of safety and reliability,  and  includes  (i)  operations  and  maintenance,  (ii)  asset  management,  and  (iii)  development,  engineering  and construction.\n\n## Operations & Maintenance\n\nNRG operates and maintains its generation portfolio, as well as approximately 7,377 MW of additional coal and natural gas  generation  capacity  at  12  plants  operated  on  behalf  of  third  parties  as  of  December  31,  2021  using  prudent  industry practices  for  the  safe,  reliable  and  economic  generation  of  electricity  in  compliance  with  all  local,  state  and  federal requirements.

Measures the percentage of maximum generation available over time as the fraction of net maximum generation that could be provided over a defined period of time after all types of outages and deratings, including seasonal deratings, are taken into account.\n\nNet Heat Rate - The net heat rate represents the total amount of fuel in BTU required to generate one net kWh provided.\n\nNet Capacity Factor - The net amount of electricity that a generating unit produces over a period of time divided by the net amount of electricity it could have produced if it had run at full power over that time period. The net amount of electricity produced is the total amount of electricity generated minus the amount of electricity used during generation by the station.\n\nThe tables below presents these performance metrics for the Company's generation portfolio, including leased facilities, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                                       | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021                   | Year Ended December 31, 2021           | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                       |                                |                                                | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a)         | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a) | Fossil and Nuclear Plants  (a) |\n|                                                       | Net Owned Capacity (MW)  (b)   | Net Generation     (In thousands of  MWh)  (a) | Annual Equivalent  Availability Factor | Average Net Heat  Rate BTU/kWh | Net Capacity Factor            |\n| Texas   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 10,083                         | 36,920                                         | 70.6 %                                 | 10,717                         | 42.4 %                         |\n| East  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 5,476                          | 7,494                                          | 79.8 %                                 | 11,877                         | 8.8 %                          |\n| West/Services/Other                                   | 2,318                          | 7,949                                          | 88.0 %                                 | 7,337                          | 47.2 %                         |",

customers.  In  Texas,  there  is  healthy  competition  in  deregulated  areas  and  customers  can  choose  providers based on the most appealing offers. Outside of Texas, electricity retailers compete with the incumbent utilities, in addition to other retail electric providers, which can inhibit competition depending on the market rules of the state. There is a high degree of fragmentation, with both large and small competitors offering a range of value propositions, including value, rewards, and sustainability-based offerings.\n\nWholesale generation is highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure by region. As such, there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identities of the Company's competitors depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.\n\n## Seasonality and Price Volatility\n\nThe  sale  of  power  and  natural  gas  to  retail  customers  are  seasonal  businesses  with  the  demand  for  power  generally peaking  during  the  summer,  and  the  demand  for  natural  gas  generally  peaking  during  the  winter.  As  a  result,  net  working capital requirements for the Company's retail operations generally increase during summer and winter months along with the higher  revenues,  and  then  decline  during  off-peak  months.  Weather  may  impact  operating  results  and  extreme  weather conditions could have a material impact. The rates charged to retail customers may be impacted by fluctuations in total power",

Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the regions in which the Company operates.\n\n## Market Framework\n\nNRG sells electricity, natural gas and related products and services to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. In most of the states and regions that have introduced retail consumer choice, NRG competitively offers electricity, natural gas, portable power and other value-enhancing services to customers. Each retail consumer choice state or province establishes its own retail competition  laws  and  regulations,  and  the  specific  operational,  licensing,  and  compliance  requirements  vary  by  state  or province.  Regulated  terms  and  conditions  of  default  service,  as  well  as  any  movement  to  replace  default  service  with competitive  services,  as  is  done  in  ERCOT,  can  affect  customer  participation  in  retail  competition.  In  Canada,  NRG  sells energy and related services to residential and commercial customers in the province of Alberta pursuant both to a regulated rate service governed by provincial regulations as well as a competitive service with rates set by market forces. Sales of energy to commercial customers take place in other provinces as well. The attractiveness of NRG's retail offerings may be impacted by the  rules,  regulations,  market  structure  and  communication  requirements  from  public  utility  commissions  in  each  state  and province.\n\nNRG's fleet of power plants which it owns, operates or manages are located in organized energy markets, known as RTOs or  ISOs.  Each  organized  market  administers  day-ahead  and  real-time  centralized  bid-based  energy  and  ancillary  services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, market rules approved by the PUCT. These tariffs and rules dictate how the energy markets operate, how market participants make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Established prices reflect the value of energy at the specific location and time it is delivered, which is known as the Locational Marginal Price. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of locational market power. These market structures facilitate NRG's sale of power and capacity products at market-based rates.\n\nOther  than  ERCOT,  each  of  the  ISO  regions  also  operates  a  capacity  or  resource  adequacy  market  that  provides  an opportunity for generating and demand response resources to earn revenues to offset their fixed costs that are not recovered in the energy and ancillary services markets. The ISOs are also responsible for transmission planning and operations.\n\n## Texas\n\nNRG's  business  in  Texas  is  subject  to  standards  and  regulations  adopted  by  the  PUCT  and  ERCOT (a) ,  including  the requirement for retailers to be certified by the PUCT in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity. The ERCOT market is  one  of  the  nation's  largest  and,  historically,  fastest  growing  power  markets.  ERCOT  is  an  energy-only  market  and  has implemented market rule changes referred to as the ORDC to provide pricing more reflective of higher energy value when operating reserves are scarce or constrained. The PUCT directed the implementation of the ORDC in 2014 to act as the primary scarcity pricing mechanism, with subsequent amendments made in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The majority of the retail load in the ERCOT market  region  is  served  by  competitive  retail  suppliers,  except  certain  areas  that  have  not  opted  into  competitive consumer choice and are served by municipal utilities and electric cooperatives.\n\n## East\n\nWhile most of the states in the East region of the U.S. have introduced some level of retail consumer choice for electricity and/or natural gas, the incumbent utilities currently provide default service in most of the states and as a result typically serve the majority of residential customers. NRG's retail activities in the East are subject to standards and regulations adopted by the ISOs, state public utility commissions and legislators, including the requirement for retailers to be certified in each state in order to contract with end-users to sell electricity.",

        "page_content": "Power plants owned, operated and managed by NRG and NRG's demand response assets located in the East region of the U.S. are within the control areas of PJM, NYISO and MISO. Each of the market regions in the East region provides for robust competition in the day-ahead and real-time energy and ancillary services markets. Additionally, the assets in the East region receive a significant portion of their revenues from capacity markets. PJM uses a forward capacity auction, while NYISO uses a month-ahead capacity auction. MISO has an annual auction. Capacity market prices are sensitive to design parameters, as well as additions of new capacity. PJM operates a pay-for-performance model where capacity payments are modified based on realtime generator performance. In such markets, NRG's actual capacity revenues will be the combination of cleared auction prices times the quantity of MW cleared, plus the net of any over-performance \"bonus payments\" and any under-performance charges. Additionally, bidding rules allow for the incorporation of a risk premium into generator bids.\n\n## West\n\nIn the West region of the U.S., NRG owns equity interests in natural gas-fired power plants located entirely within the CAISO footprint.  The  CAISO operates  day-ahead  and  real-time  locational  markets  for  energy  and  ancillary  services,  while managing congestion primarily through nodal prices. The CAISO system facilitates NRG's sale of power, ancillary services and capacity  products  at  market-based  rates,  either  within  the  CAISO's  centralized  energy  and  ancillary  service  markets  or bilaterally pursuant to tolling arrangements or other capacity sales with California's LSEs. The CPUC also determines capacity requirements for LSEs and for specified local areas utilizing inputs from the CAISO. Both the CAISO and CPUC rules require LSEs to contract with sufficient generation resources in order to maintain minimum levels of generation within defined local areas.  Additionally,  the  CAISO  has  independent  authority  to  contract  with  needed  resources  under  certain  circumstances, typically either when LSEs have failed to procure sufficient resources, or system conditions change unexpectedly.\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, NRG sells to residential and commercial retail customers in Alberta under both regulated rates approved by the AUC as well as through competitive service. The Company's regulated rates are approved through periodic rate applications that  establish  rates  for  power  and  gas  sales  as  well  as  for  recovery  of  other  costs  associated  with  operating  the  regulated business.  In  addition,  the  Company  sells  energy  to  commercial  customers  in  other  provinces.  All  sales  and  operations  are subject to applicable federal and provincial laws.\n\n## Regulatory Matters\n\nAs participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generation or distributed generation assets are located. In addition,  NRG  is  subject  to  the  market  rules,  procedures  and  protocols  of  the  various  ISO  and  RTO  markets  in  which  it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the  states  and  provinces  in  which  NRG  entities  are  licensed  to  sell  at  retail.  NRG  must  also  comply  with  the  mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates.\n\nNRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT, as well as to regulation by the NRC with respect to NRG's ownership interest in STP.\n\n## Federal Energy Regulation\n\nIn March 2021, President Biden announced a framework for his \"Build Back Better\" initiative which includes policies to address climate change across the whole of the federal government through the tax code, an energy efficiency and clean energy incentives, research and development, among other areas of focus. The \"Build Back Better\" initiative has taken the form of two separate bills in Congress. The $1.2 trillion \"core infrastructure\" bill, which contains spending on new electric vehicle charging programs,  among  other  things,  was  signed  into  law  by  President  Biden  on  November  15,  2021.  The  remaining  priorities, commonly referred to as \"Build Back Better,\" are being monitored by NRG as they progress through the legislative process.\n\n## State and Provincial Energy Regulation\n\nIllinois  Legislation -  Illinois  enacted  the  Climate  and  Equitable  Jobs  Act  (\"CEJA\")  on  September  15,  2021,  which targets  100% clean energy by 2050. CEJA focuses on (i) decarbonization, (ii) incentives to transition coal plants into clean energy facilities and (iii) nuclear subsidies. CEJA requires non-publicly owned coal or oil electric generating units larger than 25 MWs to eliminate CO2e and copollutant emissions by January 1, 2030. Non-publicly owned electric generating units that are gas-fired, including Joliet, must eliminate CO2e and copollutant emissions, including through unit retirement or the use of 100% green hydrogen, in a timeframe ranging from January 1, 2030 to January 1, 2045 depending on certain emission rates and proximity to environmental justice communities. Furthermore, CEJA placed restrictions, with immediate effect, on gas-fired units that limits future emissions to their historic baselines. These limits affect the total potential energy production by gas units in  Illinois.  PJM,  the  PJM  Independent  Market  Monitor  and  the  Illinois  Environmental  Protection  Agency  have  exchanged",

The new energy law also provides $174 million in incentives to develop solar and battery storage at coal generating sites that may be available to NRG.\n\n## Regional Regulatory Developments\n\nNRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments see Item 15 -  Note 24, Regulatory Matters, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Texas\n\nPublic Utility Commission of Texas' Actions with Respect to Wholesale Pricing and Market Design In September 2021, the PUCT opened a rulemaking project to evaluate whether it should amend its rules to modify the High System Wide Offer cap (\"HCAP\") and the ORDC, which is intended to ensure prices in the competitive market appropriately reflect the value of operating  reserves  as  the  system  approaches  scarcity  conditions.  This  rulemaking  project  concluded  in  December  2021, resulting in a rule amendment that lowered the HCAP to $5,000 per MWh and which expands the minimum contingency level to 3,000 MW. These two changes are broadly offsetting in their effect on overall average energy prices.\n\nActivity on Securitization and ERCOT Pricing during Winter Storm Uri The Texas Legislature acted to pass a variety of  securitization  vehicles  to  finance  exceptionally  high  power  and  gas  costs  from  Winter  Storm  Uri,  including  HB  4492. ERCOT subsequently filed  two  applications  requesting  the  PUCT  to  issue  Debt  Obligation  Orders  (\"DOOs\")  based  on  the legislation. On October 13, 2021, the PUCT issued DOOs authorizing ERCOT's securitization of $800 million to cover short payments and reimburse congestion revenue right account holders for amounts related to the default of market participants other than  electric  cooperatives  Brazos  and  Rayburn,  which  are  discussed  below  (the  \"Default  Securitization\")  and  $2.1  billion related to highly priced ancillary service and ORPDA during Winter Storm Uri (the \"Uplift Securitization\").\n\nThe DOOs require ERCOT to issue loans or securitized bonds through a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity as the borrower and distribute the proceeds to affected market participants for default-related short payments and to LSEs for certain ancillary-service and ORDPA costs using an allocation of proceeds based on an LSE's exposure to relevant costs as calculated by the LSE's prevailing load-ratio share during the period of Winter Storm Uri, and a further redistribution of proceeds initially allocated to other LSEs and customers who opt-out of securitization. In turn, ERCOT will charge non-bypassable fees related to the Default Securitization and Uplift Securitization to all qualified scheduling entities and to all LSEs (other than those that have  opted-out),  respectively.  The  Uplift  Securitization  provided  for  a  one-time  opt-out  for  certain  LSEs  or  individual transmission-level  customers  who  in  exchange  for  foregoing  any  securitization-related  proceeds  likewise  avoid  future  fees assessed by ERCOT for the use of repaying ERCOT's debt obligations. However, nearly all competitive REPs were required by the law to participate, ensuring the charge established by the law is competitively neutral. These opt-outs and calculations of the allocation of proceeds have been finalized. Based on LSE-level detail published by the PUCT on December 7, 2021, NRG will receive $689 million of Uplift Securitization proceeds, with receipt expected to occur during the second quarter of 2022. The $800 million Default Securitization was disbursed by ERCOT in November 2021, with NRG receiving $12 million.\n\nElectric Cooperative Bankruptcy and Securitization - Of the defaults in the ERCOT market, two electric cooperatives, Brazos and Rayburn, constitute the vast majority. Brazos currently is in bankruptcy. NRG and ERCOT have both filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding of Brazos, and Brazos has challenged ERCOT's claims in a manner that may prejudice NRG's claims against Brazos. During the fourth quarter of 2021, ERCOT filed a motion to dismiss Brazos' complaint relating to ERCOT's proof of claim, which NRG joined in support, but this motion was denied by the Bankruptcy Court, and ERCOT, NRG and certain other parties appealed. On January 11, 2022, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered an order allowing the appellants to seek direct review from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals of the Bankruptcy Court's decision on the motion to dismiss. On January 18, 2022, ERCOT, NRG and certain other parties filed a petition for direct review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The Court of Appeals granted the petition on February 4,  2022.  On  February  7,  2022,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  entered  an  order  granting  summary  judgement  in  favor  of  Brazos  on whether ERCOT's sales to Brazos were in the ordinary course of Brazos' business. The Bankruptcy Court ruled that the portion of ERCOT's claims for charges incurred by Brazos after the intervention of the PUCT and ERCOT were not in the ordinary course  and  thus  are  not  entitled  to  administrative  expense  status  under  the  Bankruptcy  Code.  The  amount  and  priority  of ERCOT's claim for amounts incurred prior to such intervention or after such intervention ceased are issues to be determined at trial. The Bankruptcy Court's summary judgement ruling may also apply to NRG's claims again Brazos. Trial on the merits of the ERCOT proof of claim and Brazos' complaint is set to commence before the Bankruptcy Court on February 22, 2022. To the extent the Bankruptcy Court reduces or disallows claims against Brazos, this presents risk for NRG.\n\nERCOT's market protocols provide for short payments to be extinguished through a process of uplift, whereby the cost of defaults is allocated to all market participants, including retailers, generators, municipal and cooperative utilities, and financial traders.  However,  the  total  amount  of  this  uplift  is  limited  by  ERCOT's  current  protocols  of  $2.5  million  per  month. Consequently, it  would  take  approximately  63  years  for  the  net  short-pay  balance  of  $1.887  billion  related  to  Brazos  to  be uplifted to the market under the current market rules. NRG's undiscounted share of the uplift based on its current market share",

The  remaining  $53  million  has  been discounted based on the 63 year repayment term and present value of $9 million was recorded as an additional liability.\n\nRayburn announced that it intended to securitize the amounts owed to ERCOT and payment from such securitization is expected in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nReliability and Plant Operations Standards - The PUCT established a rulemaking to establish weatherization standards, and issued a notice for comments in response to provisions of Texas Senate Bill 3 (\"SB3\") that require mandatory standards for power  generators  and  others  within  the  electric-power  sector.  SB3  provides  that  the  standards  adopted  by  the  PUCT  be implemented by generation owners, be subject to ERCOT inspections, and that ERCOT provide asset owners with a reasonable period of time to remedy any violation. Continuing violations would be subject to an administrative penalty and a requirement that  a  third-party  contractor  assess  the  asset  owner's  weatherization  plans.  On  August  24,  2021,  Commission  Staff  issued  a proposal of weatherization standards for publication. NRG, through its trade association, filed comments. On October 21, 2021, Commissioners of the PUCT voted to adopt the rule without substantial modifications from the proposal.\n\n## PJM\n\nPJM's Variable Resource Requirement Curve On July 9, 2021, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a decision  denying  in  part  and  granting  in  part  an  appeal  by  several  PJM  state  consumer  advocates  regarding  FERC's  order approving revisions to PJM's Variable Resource Requirement Curve ('VRR'). The court upheld PJM's use of a greenfield gasfired combustion turbine as the reference unit to establish Net Cost of New Entry (\"Net CONE\"). However, the court remanded back to FERC the issue of allowing generators to have a 10% adder to their offer to supply capacity in the PJM market, and on January 20, 2022, FERC issued an order removing the 10% adder. The VRR is the demand curve that represents the slope of bids in the auction that ultimately results in the price and quantity of capacity allocated to load-serving entities, including NRG. The VRR curve is based on several inputs, including the Net CONE. The outcome could affect PJM's capacity market prices.\n\nPJM Revisions to Minimum Offer Price Rule On July 30, 2021, PJM filed proposed tariff changes at FERC to largely eliminate the current minimum offer price rules (\"MOPR\") except in very narrow cases. The proposal would eliminate: (i) the current MOPR for new entrant natural gas resources effective with the 2023/2024 delivery year and (ii) the expanded MOPR established in FERC's December 2019 Order to address out-of-market subsidies. On September 30, 2021, PJM's proposal went into effect by operation of law because the FERC Commissioners were split 2-2 as to the lawfulness of the change. Multiple parties  filed  motions  for  rehearing  and  ultimately  appealed  to  the  federal  court  of  appeals.  On  December  21,  2021  and December 30, 2021, respectively, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order holding the appeals in abeyance. The proposed revisions would allow PJM to address specific and narrow instances of buyerside market power through subsequent filings at FERC. Any changes to the PJM capacity market construct may impact the outcome of future Base Residual Auctions.\n\nPJM's ORDC Filing and Compliance Directives - On May 21, 2020, PJM proposed energy and reserve market reforms to enhance price formation in reserve markets, which included modifying ORDC and aligning market-based reserve products in Day-Ahead and Real-Time markets. In addition to approving PJM's proposal, FERC also directed PJM to implement a forwardlooking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset to be used in PJM's capacity markets. After multiple compliance filings, parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit of FERC's orders, and on August 13, 2021, FERC filed a motion and was granted  a  voluntary  remand  the  case  back  to  the  agency.  On  December  22,  2021,  FERC  issued  its  order  on  voluntary remand affirming in part and reversing in part FERC's determination. Specifically, FERC reversed itself and ordered PJM to: (i) eliminate  the  more  robust  ORDC  curves  and  reserve  penalty  adders  and  maintain  the  existing  (lower)  curves  and  (lower) penalty adders and (ii) restore its tariff provisions related to its prior backward-looking Energy and Ancillary Services Offset. At the direction of FERC, on January 21, 2022, PJM filed a compliance fling proposing a new schedule for the Base Residual Auctions.\n\nIndependent Market Monitor Market Seller Offer Cap Complaint On March 18, 2021, finding that the calculation of the  default  Market  Seller  Offer  Cap  was  unjust  and  unreasonable,  the  Order  permitted  the  current  PJM  May  2021  capacity auction for the 2022/2023 delivery rule to continue under the existing rules and set a procedural schedule for parties to file briefs  with  possible  solutions.  On  September  2,  2021,  FERC  issued  an  order  in  response  to  a  complaint  filed  by  the  PJM Independent  Market  Monitor's  proposal,  which  eliminates  the  Cost  of  New  Entry-based  Market  Seller  Offer  Cap  and implements  a  limited  default  cap  for  certain  asset  classes  based  on  going-forward  costs  and  provides  for  unit  specific  cost review  by  the  Independent  Market  Monitor  for  all  other  non-zero  offers  into  the  auctions.  As  required  by  the  Order,  PJM submitted  its  compliance  tariff  on  October  4,  2021.  On  October  4,  certain  parties  filed  a  motion  for  rehearing.  which  was denied.  Multiple  parties  filed  appeals  at  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  D.C.  Circuit.  The  appeals  are  currently  being  held  in abeyance. The removal of the Offer Caps may impact the outcome of future Base Residual Auctions.",

The proposal would remove certain facilities to be reviewed under the buyer-side mitigation rules to serve the goals of New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, adopt a marginal capacity accreditation market design and adjust the rules surrounding installed and unforced capacity. Changes to NYISO's Buyer Side Mitigation rules may impact the outcome of future capacity auctions.\n\n## California\n\nCalifornia Resource Adequacy Proceedings - On March 25, 2021, the CPUC directed the state's major investor-owned utilities  to  engage  in  up  to  1.5  GW  of  emergency  procurement  for  2021  and  2022  and  is  currently  evaluating  further procurement directives through 2023. In the same docket, the CPUC approved a new demand response program for use during emergency conditions. As part of the Integrated Resource Procurement docket, the CPUC approved a decision on June 24, 2021 that will require all Load Serving Entities to procure a pro rata share of 11.5 GW of new non-fossil resource adequacy from 2023 to 2026. To replace the retiring Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, this will consist largely of GHG-free energy, long-duration storage,  baseload  renewables  and  energy  storage.  A  new  resource  adequacy  docket  opened  in  October  2021  will  consider changes to the reserve margin and qualifying capacity of different resource types, and the CPUC and CAISO will continue to evaluate major structural reforms to the resource adequacy program in California that would begin in 2024.\n\nMidway-Sunset Reliability Must Run Proceeding San Joaquin Energy, LLC, a subsidiary of NRG, owns a 50%, noncontrolling  interest  in  the  Midway-Sunset  Cogeneration  Company  (\"MSCC\").  MSCC  owns  a  cogeneration  facility  near Fellows, California and submitted mothball notices for the cogeneration facility to the CAISO in the latter half of 2020. On December 17, 2020, the CAISO Board effectively rejected the mothball notices by authorizing its staff to designate the MSCC facility as a reliability must-run (\"RMR\") resource conditioned on execution of a RMR contract. On January 29, 2021, MSCC made its RMR filing at FERC. Multiple parties filed protests and on March 16, 2021, MSCC filed a response to those protests. On April 2, 2021, FERC accepted the RMR filing, suspended it to become effective February 1, 2021 subject to refund and established hearing and settlement judge proceedings. The parties are engaging in settlement proceedings. On September 27, 2021, the CAISO gave notice to MSCC extending the term of the reliability designation through December 31, 2022.\n\n## Canada\n\nAlberta Energy Market - In December 2020, prior to its acquisition by NRG, Direct Energy filed a Non-Energy Rate Application with the AUC to approve cost recovery for the 2020-2022 period. Major cost elements of this application relate to bad  debt,  corporate  costs,  and  customer  care  and  billing  contracts.  The  Company  engaged  in  a  mediation  and  settlement process, and on April 20, 2021 an all-party settlement was executed, and was filed with the AUC on April 23, 2021. The AUC approved the settlement agreement on June 4, 2021. Separately, the Company received approval from the AUC of a negotiated rate  settlement  for  its  electricity  focused  2020-2022  Energy  Price  Setting  Plan  which  went  into  effect  on  July  1,  2021.  The Company has completed the last repayment to the Balancing Pool and the Alberta government as part of its 90-day utility bill deferral  program.  This  program,  effective  March  18,  2020,  was  designed  to  assist  residential,  farms,  and  small  business customers who were negatively affected by COVID-19 related economic circumstances by temporarily deferring their utility bill payments. The program was also designed to mitigate bad debt risks associated with the implementation of the program.\n\n## Environmental Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during  operation  of  power  plants.  Federal  and  state  environmental  laws  historically  have  become  more  stringent  over  time. Future  laws  may  require  the  addition  of  emissions  controls  or  other  environmental  controls  or  impose  restrictions  on  the Company's operations. Complying with environmental laws often involves specialized human resources and significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital.\n\nA  number  of  regulations  that  affect  the  Company  have  been  revised  recently  by  the  EPA,  including  ash  storage  and disposal requirements, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent limitation guidelines. Some of these recent revisions may, in turn, be revised by the current U.S. presidential administration. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions and legal challenges are resolved.\n\n## Air\n\nThe  CAA  and  related  regulations  (as  well  as  similar  state  and  local  requirements)  have  the  potential  to  affect  air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO2, ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are",

        "page_content": "classified  by  the  EPA  as  not  achieving  certain  NAAQS  (non-attainment  areas).  The  relevant  NAAQS  may  become  more stringent.  The  Company  maintains  a  comprehensive  compliance  strategy  to  address  continuing  and  new  requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some  NRG  facilities  or  retiring  of  units  if  installing  such  controls  is  not  economic.  Significant  changes  to  air  regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below.\n\nCPP/ACE Rules -The  attention  in  recent  years  on  GHG  emissions  has  resulted  in  federal  and  state  regulations.  In October 2015, the EPA promulgated the CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. In July 2019, EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit's decision, which should provide some clarity regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. The Company expects the EPA to promulgate a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from power plants after a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions -  NRG emits CO 2 (and small quantities of other GHGs) when generating electricity at a majority  of  its  facilities.  Nearly  all  (>99%)  of  NRG's  domestic  GHG  emissions  are  subject  to  federal  (U.S.  EPA)  GHG reporting requirements.\n\nNRG's climate goals are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2025, from its current 2014 baseline, and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions include directly controlled emissions, emissions from NRG's purchased energy, and emissions from employee business travel. In 2021, NRG's climate goals were certified by the Science Based Targets initiative as aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory. From the current 2014 baseline to 2021, the Company's CO2e emissions decreased from 61 million metric tons to 34 million metric tons, representing a cumulative 44% reduction. The decrease is attributed to reductions in fleet-wide annual net generation and a market-driven shift away from coal as a primary fuel to natural gas. The increase in emissions in 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily due to higher power demand which was  a  result  of  the  easing  of  COVID-19  pandemic  lockdowns  and  the  associated  economic  recovery.  The  Company  is continuing to target a 50% reduction by 2025 and is on track to meet that goal.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, less than 5% of the Company's consolidated operating revenues were derived from coal-fired operating assets.\n\nThe following charts reflect the Company's domestic generation portfolio, including leased facilities and those accounted for through equity method investments. Prior year information was adjusted to remove divested assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination\n\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider the rule. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the existing ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy ponds. In 2019 and 2020, the EPA proposed several changes to this rule. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments,\" which further amended the April 2015 Rule to, among other things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner.\n\n## Domestic Site Remediation Matters\n\nUnder certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances  or  petroleum  products.  NRG  may  be  responsible  for  property  damage,  personal  injury  and  investigation  and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. Further discussions of affected NRG sites can be found in Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nJewett Mine Lignite Contract -The Company's Limestone facility historically burned lignite obtained from the Jewett mine, which was operated by TWCC. In 2019, the Jewett mine and related lignite supply agreement with NRG were acquired by  Westmoreland Jewett Mining LLC (\"Jewett Mining\"), a subsidiary of Westmoreland Mining LLC pursuant to a plan of reorganization  confirmed  by  the  Texas  Bankruptcy  Court.  Effective  August  5,  2020,  NRG's  subsidiary,  NRG  Texas  LLC, acquired all of the equity interests of Jewett Mining. Active mining under the lignite supply agreement ceased as of December 31,  2016;  however,  under  the  terms  of  the  lignite  supply  agreement,  Jewett  Mining  remains  responsible  for  reclamation activities  and  NRG  is  responsible  for  all  reclamation  costs.  NRG  has  recorded  an  adequate  ARO  liability.  The  Railroad Commission of Texas has imposed a bond obligation of approximately $99 million for the reclamation of the Jewett mine, which NRG supports through surety bonds. The cost of the reclamation may exceed the value of the bonds. NRG may provide additional performance assurance if required by the Railroad Commission of Texas.\n\nNuclear Waste - The federal government's program to construct a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada was  discontinued  in  2010.  Since  1998,  the  U.S.  DOE  has  been  in  default  of  the  federal  government's  obligations  to  begin accepting spent nuclear fuel, or SNF, and high-level radioactive waste, or HLW, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. Owners of  nuclear  plants,  including  the  owners  of  STP,  had  been  required  to  enter  into  contracts  setting  out  the  obligations  of  the owners and the U.S. DOE, including the fees to be paid by the owners for the U.S. DOE's services to license a spent fuel repository. Effective May 16, 2014, the U.S. DOE stopped collecting the fees.\n\nOn February 5, 2013, STPNOC entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOE for payment of damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act through December 31, 2013, which has been extended three times through addendums to cover payments through December 31, 2022. There are no facilities for the reprocessing or permanent disposal of SNF currently in operation in the U.S., nor has the NRC licensed any such facilities. STPNOC currently stores all SNF generated by its nuclear generating facilities on-site. STPNOC plans to continue to assert claims against the U.S. DOE for damages relating to the U.S. DOE's failure to accept SNF and HLW.\n\nUnder the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980, as amended in 1985, the state of Texas is required to provide, either on its own or jointly with other states in a compact, for the disposal of all low-level radioactive waste generated within the state. Texas is currently in a compact with the state of Vermont, and the compact low-level waste facility located in Andrews County in Texas has been operational since 2012.\n\n## Water\n\nThe  Company  is  required  under  the  CWA  to  comply  with  intake  and  discharge  requirements,  requirements  for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements.",

        "page_content": "Effluent Limitations Guidelines - I n November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines (\"ELG\") for Steam  Electric  Generating  Facilities,  which  imposed  more  stringent  requirements  (as  individual  permits  were  renewed)  for wastewater  streams  from  FGD,  fly  ash,  bottom  ash,  and  flue  gas  mercury  control.  On  September  18,  2017,  the  EPA promulgated  a  final  rule  that,  among  other  things,  postponed  the  compliance  dates  to  preserve  the  status  quo  for  FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. On July 26, 2021, the EPA announced that it is initiating a new rulemaking to evaluate revising the ELG rule. While the EPA is developing the new rule, the existing rule (as amended in 2020) will stay in place, and the EPA expects permitting authorities to continue to implement the  current  regulation.  The  EPA  anticipates  releasing  a  proposed  rule  in  fall  2022.  In  October  2021,  NRG  informed  its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants in Texas.\n\n## Regional Environmental Developments\n\nAsh Regulation in Illinois - On July 30, 2019, Illinois enacted legislation that requires the state to promulgate regulations regarding  coal  ash  at  surface  impoundments.  On  April  15,  2021,  the  state  promulgated  the  implementing  regulation,  which became effective on April 21, 2021. The new regulation requires NRG to apply for initial operating permits for its coal ash surface impoundments by October 31, 2021 and construction permits (for closure) starting in 2022.\n\n## Customers\n\nNRG sells  to  a  wide  variety  of  customers,  primarily  end-use  customers  in  the  residential,  commercial  and  industrial sectors. The Company owns and operates power plants to generate and sell power to wholesale customers, such as utilities and other intermediaries. The Company had no customer that comprised more than 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries had 6,635 employees, approximately 13% of whom were covered by U.S. collective bargaining agreements. During 2021, the Company did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of its facilities.\n\nNRG believes  its  employees  are  vital  to  its  success  and  is  committed  to  offering  employees  a  rewarding  career  that provides opportunities for growth and the ability to make valuable contributions toward the achievement of the Company's business objectives. NRG focuses on safety, health and wellness, diversity, equity and inclusion, talent development and total rewards for its employees.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety  is  embedded  in  the  culture  at  NRG.  The  Company  strives  to  begin  each  meeting  with  a  safety  moment  and regularly reminds its employees that safety comes first. NRG has achieved its targeted top decile safety record of Occupational Safety and Health Administration recordable injury rates in each of the 5 previous years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Health and Wellness\n\nFor several years, NRG has invested in the well-being of its employees and their families. NRG provides programs that holistically  support  its  employees'  physical,  emotional  and  financial  wellness,  allowing  employees  the  opportunity  to  take control of their well-being and focus on what matters most to them for a healthy, secure future.\n\nDuring 2020, the Company evaluated its approach to health and well-being in light of the circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to COVID-19, NRG implemented additional programs to provide services to support the needs of employees, including those working from home, such as programs that provided back-up childcare, expanded access to telemedicine (for both physical and mental health), and supported mental and emotional well-being through programs such as mindfulness.  During  2021,  the  Company  continued  its  support  of  employees  by  partnering  with  the  National  Council  for Behavioral Health to roll out their Mental Health First Aid program. This program safely, respectfully and effectively opens the conversation about mental illness and addiction, encourages employees to recognize and take responsibility for their mental health, teaches managers to recognize and speak to an employee with a mental health concern before it creates performance problems, complements and supports existing benefit and wellness programs and company's policies and procedures.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nNRG  is  committed  to  diversity,  equity  and  inclusion  (\"DE&I\")  as  an  integral  part  of  the  Company.  In  2020,  NRG completed a gender and race pay equity study to ensure that the Company's pay decisions were not influenced by gender, race, or other similar factors. The study showed equitable pay practices after accounting for education, experience, performance and location. NRG also conducted company-wide unconscious bias training to help all employees recognize, understand, and reduce implicit bias and offers various other related guides and tools to its employees and management.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Company  focused  on  embedding  DE&I  in  the  Company's  operations,  culture  and  communications,  by working  with  diverse  suppliers,  finding  diverse  talent,  facilitating  engagement  and  awareness  of  DE&I  by  employees,  and committing to be accountable for our DE&I progress.\n\n## Talent Development\n\nNRG deploys various talent development strategies and programs with the goal of ensuring a pipeline of leadership who can execute on the Company's strategy and drive value for all stakeholders. The Board of Directors regularly engages with management  on  leadership  development  and  succession  planning,  including  providing  feedback  on  development  plans  and bench strength for key senior leader positions. The Board of Directors also has a structured program that allows directors to interact  directly  with  individuals  deeper  within  the  organization  whom  management,  through  a  robust  talent  assessment program, as well as mentoring relationships, has identified as high potential future leaders. In 2021, the Company launched an Executive  Leadership  Program  to  strengthen  the  identified  pipeline  of  future  leaders  and  create  a  cohort  of  high  potential candidates for the program. The Company has a performance management tool that emphasizes a continuous feedback loop and a robust online training curriculum with topics including leadership, communication and productivity.\n\n## Total Rewards\n\nNRG seeks to provide the median target of compensation and benefits, benchmarked against direct peers, industry, and, where  appropriate,  general  peers.  To  ensure  incentives  are  properly  aligned  with  business  needs  and  can  attract  and  retain qualified  employees,  the  Compensation  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors  actively  reviews  the  Company's  total  rewards programs, including benchmarking programs against peer groups, assessing the risks of programs and evaluating the design of the annual and long-term incentive programs. The Company offers full-time employees incentives designed to motivate and reward success. NRG continues to evaluate its offerings taking into consideration the needs of its employees to ensure they are competitive and best serve its employees. Every two years, the Company engages an independent third party to benchmark its compensation and benefits programs against its peers and report the results to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nFor further discussion and recent available data regarding the Company's efforts and programs please see the Company's 2021  Proxy  Statement  and  2020  Sustainability  Report,  which  are  available  on  the  Company's  website  at: www.nrg.com .

        "page_content": "## Item 1A - Risk Factors\n\nNRG's risk factors are grouped into the following categories: (i) Risks Related to the Acquisition of Direct Energy; (ii) Risks  Related  to  the  Operation  of  NRG's  Business;  (iii)  Risks  Related  to  Governmental  Regulation  and  Laws;  (iv)  Risks Related to Public Health Threats; and (v) Risks Related to Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and the Company's Indebtedness.\n\n## Risks Related to the Acquisition of Direct Energy\n\n## The acquisition of Direct Energy may not achieve its intended results.\n\nAchieving the anticipated benefits of cost savings and operating efficiencies of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of NRG and Direct Energy are integrated in an efficient and effective manner. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, lower-than-expected revenues or income generated by  the  combined  company  and  diversion  of  management's  time  and  energy,  which  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the Company's business, financial results and prospects.\n\n## The  Company will  be  subject  to  business  uncertainties  related  to  Direct  Energy  that  could  adversely  affect  its  financial results.\n\nUncertainty about the effects of the acquisition of Direct Energy on employees, customers and suppliers may have an adverse effect on NRG's business. Although the Company intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel for a period of time, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with it to seek to change existing business relationships.\n\nEmployee  retention  and  recruitment  may  be  particularly  challenging,  as  employees  and  prospective  employees  may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company. If, despite the Company's retention and recruiting efforts, key employees  depart  or  fail  to  accept  employment  with  NRG  because  of  issues  relating  to  the  uncertainty  and  difficulty  of integration or a desire not to remain with NRG, the Company's financial results could be affected.\n\n## The integration of NRG and Direct Energy may disrupt or have a negative impact on the Company's business.\n\nThe acquisition of Direct Energy is complex, and the Company will devote significant time and resources to integrating its operations  with  the  operations  of  NRG.  NRG  could  have  difficulty  integrating  the  acquired  assets  and  personnel  of  Direct Energy with its own. The integration of NRG and Direct Energy may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks that could impact the Company negatively include:\n\n- \u00b7 the difficulty of managing and integrating Direct Energy and its operations;\n- \u00b7 the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of management;\n- \u00b7 changes in our business focus and/or management;\n- \u00b7 difficulties  in  implementing  and  maintaining  uniform  processes,  systems,  standards,  controls,  procedures,  practices, policies and compensation standards;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications, and other systems;\n- \u00b7 the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n- \u00b7 the potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners;\n- \u00b7 unforeseen expenses associated with the acquisition of Direct Energy, including delays to the integration of Direct Energy's business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- \u00b7 the potential difficulty in managing an increased number of locations and employees;\n- \u00b7 the potential loss of valuable employees;\n- \u00b7 difficulty addressing any possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n- \u00b7 unanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations; and\n- \u00b7 the effect of any government regulations that relate to the business acquired.\n\nIf  the  Company is not successful in addressing these risks effectively, the business could be impacted. Many of these factors will be outside of the Company's control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially affect NRG's business, results of operations and financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## Risks Related to the Operation of NRG's Business\n\n## NRG's financial  performance  may  be  impacted  by  price  fluctuations  in  the  retail  and  wholesale  power  and  natural  gas markets, as well as fluctuations in coal and oil markets and other market factors that are beyond the Company's control.\n\nMarket prices for power, capacity, ancillary services, natural gas, coal and oil are unpredictable and tend to fluctuate substantially. Unlike most other commodities, electric power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances,  especially  in  the  day-ahead  and  spot  markets.  Long  and  short-term  power  and  gas  prices  may  also  fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of the Company's control, including:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in generation capacity in the Company's markets, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new plants, expansion of existing plants, the continued operation of uneconomic power plants due to state subsidies, retirement of existing plants or addition of new transmission capacity;\n- \u00b7 environmental regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 electric supply disruptions, including plant outages and transmission disruptions;\n- \u00b7 changes in power and gas transmission infrastructure;\n- \u00b7 fuel price volatility and transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n- \u00b7 changes in law, including judicial decisions;\n- \u00b7 weather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations, including the effects of climate change;\n- \u00b7 changes in commodity prices and the supply of commodities, including but not limited to natural gas, coal and oil;\n- \u00b7 changes in the demand for power or gas, or in patterns of power or gas usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices, distributed generation, and more efficient end-use technologies;\n- \u00b7 development of new fuels, new technologies and new forms of competition for the production of power;\n- \u00b7 economic and political conditions;\n- \u00b7 federal, state and provincial power regulations and legislation, and regulations and actions of the ISO and RTOs;\n- \u00b7 changes in prices related to RECs; and\n- \u00b7 changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\n\nWhile  retail  rates  are  generally  designed  to  allow  retail  sellers  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  to  pass  through  price fluctuations  and  other  changes  to  costs,  the  Company  may  not  be  able  to  pass  through  all  such  changes  to  customers.  For example, serving retail power customers in ISOs that have a capacity market exposes the Company to the risk that capacity costs  can  change  and  may  not  be  recoverable,  or  the  Company  may  engage  in  sales  of  power  at  fixed  prices.  Additionally, increases in wholesale costs to retail customers may cause additional customer defaults or increased customer attrition, or may be impacted by regulatory rules.\n\nFurther, in low natural gas price environments, natural gas can be the more cost-competitive fuel compared to coal for generating electricity. The Company enters into guaranteed supply contracts to provide for the amount of coal needed to operate its base load coal-fired generating facilities, the Company may experience periods where it holds excess amounts of coal if fuel pricing results in the Company reducing or idling coal-fired generating facilities. In addition, the Company may incur costs to terminate supply contracts for coal in excess of its generating requirements.\n\nSuch factors and the associated fluctuations in power prices have affected the Company's wholesale and retail profitability in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.\n\n## Volatile  power  and  gas  supply  costs  and  demand  for  power  and  gas  could  adversely  affect  the  financial  performance  of NRG's retail operations.\n\nNRG's retail power operations purchase a significant portion of their supply from third parties. All of the gas sold by the Company in retail and wholesale markets is purchased from third parties. As a result, financial performance depends on the ability to obtain adequate supplies of power and gas from third parties at prices below the prices NRG charges its customers. Consequently, the Company's earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in any period in which the wholesale power or gas prices rise at a greater rate than the rates the Company can charge to customers. The price of wholesale electricity and gas supply purchases associated with the retail operations' energy commitments can be different than that reflected in the rates charged to customers due to, among other factors:\n\n- \u00b7 varying supply procurement contracts used and the timing of entering into related contracts;\n- \u00b7 subsequent changes in the overall price of natural gas;",

In addition, many of NRG's generation facilities are exposed to market risk because they operate as \"merchant\" facilities without long-term power sales agreements for some or all of their generating capacity and output. Without the benefit of long-term power sales or purchase agreements, and without long-term load obligations, NRG cannot be sure that it will be able to sell or purchase power at commercially attractive rates or that its generation facilities will be able to operate profitably. This could lead to future impairments of the Company's property, plants and equipment, the closing of certain of its facilities or the loss of retail customers, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\n## Competition  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations,  cash  flows  and  the  market  value  of  its assets.\n\nNRG has numerous competitors in all aspects of its  business,  and  additional  competitors  may  enter  the  industry.  The Company's  retail  operations  specifically  face  competition  for  customers.  Competitors  may  offer  different  products,  lower prices,  and  other  incentives  which  may  attract  customers  away  from  the  Company.  In  some  retail  electricity  markets,  the principal competitor may be the incumbent utility. The incumbent utility has the advantage of long-standing relationships with its customers and strong brand recognition. Furthermore, NRG may face competition from other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services, who may develop businesses that will compete with NRG.\n\nThe Company's plant operations face competition from newer or more efficient plants owned by competitors, which may put some of the Company's plants at a disadvantage to the extent these competitors are able to consume the same or less fuel as the Company's plant. Over time, the Company's plants may be unable to compete with these more efficient plants, which could result in retirements.\n\nNRG's competitors may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, more  effective  risk  management  policies  and  procedures,  greater  ability  to  incur  losses,  longer-standing  relationships  with customers,  greater  potential  for  profitability  from  retail  sales  or  greater  flexibility  in  the  timing  of  their  sale  of  generation capacity and ancillary services than NRG does. Competitors may also have better access to subsidies or other out-of-market payments that put NRG at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nNRG's competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws or regulations or emerging technologies, or devote greater resources to marketing of retail energy than NRG can. In addition, current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among current and new competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share.\n\nThere can be no assurance that NRG will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and any failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## NRG's costs, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely impacted by disruption of its fuel supplies.\n\nNRG relies on natural gas, coal and oil to fuel a majority of its power generation facilities. Grid operations depend on the continuing financial viability  of  contractual  counterparties,  as  well  as  the  infrastructure  (including  rail  lines,  rail  cars,  barge facilities,  roadways,  riverways  and  natural  gas  pipelines)  available  to  serve  generation  facilities  and  to  ensure  that  there  is sufficient power produced to meet retail demand. As a result, the Company's wholesale generation facilities are subject to the risks of disruptions or curtailments in the production of power at its generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price, if a counterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel delivery infrastructure.\n\nNRG routinely hedges both its wholesale sales and purchases to support its retail load obligations. In order to hedge these obligations, the Company may enter into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Many of the forward power sales contracts do not allow the Company to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majeure events or the default of a fuel supplier or transporter.",

        "page_content": "Disruptions  in  the  Company's  fuel  supplies  or  power  supply  arrangements  may  therefore  require  it  to  find  alternative  fuel sources at higher costs, to find other sources of power to deliver to retail customers or other counterparties at a higher cost, or to pay damages to counterparties for failure to deliver power or sell electricity or natural gas as contracted. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG also buys significant quantities of energy and fuel on a short-term or spot market basis. Prices sometimes rise or fall significantly over a relatively short period of time. The price NRG can obtain for the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate, or may not rise at all, to match a rise in fuel or delivery costs. Retail rates may also not rise at the same rate or may not rise at all. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance.\n\nNRG's plant operating characteristics and equipment, particularly at its coal-fired plants, often dictate the specific fuel quality to be combusted. The availability and price of specific fuel qualities may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions and force majeure. At times, coal of specific quality may not be available at any price or the Company may not be able to transport such coal to its facilities on a timely basis. In this case, the Company may not be able to run the coal facility even if it would be profitable. Operating a coal facility with different quality coal can lead to emission or operating problems. If the Company had sold forward the power from such a coal facility, it could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on the financial results of specific plants and on the Company's results of operations.\n\n## There may be periods when NRG will not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale or purchase obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.\n\nThe  Company  may  sell  fixed  price  gas  as  a  proxy  for  power.  Because  the  obligations  under  most  of  the  Company's forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, NRG is generally required to deliver power to the buyer, even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that the Company does not have sufficient lower-cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, the Company would be required to supply replacement power either by running its other, higher cost power plants  or  by  obtaining  power  from  third-party  sources  at  market  prices  that  could  substantially  exceed  the  contract  price.  If NRG fails to deliver the contracted power, it would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price, and the amount of such payments could be substantial.\n\n## NRG's trading operations and use of hedging agreements could result in financial losses that negatively impact its results of operations,  and  NRG's  hedging  activities  may  increase  the  volatility  in  the  Company's  quarterly  and  annual  financial results.\n\nThe Company typically enters  into  hedging  agreements,  including  contracts  to  purchase  or  sell  commodities  at  future dates  and  at  fixed  prices,  to  manage  the  commodity  price  risks  inherent  in  its  business.  The  Company's  risk  management policies and hedging procedures may not mitigate risk as planned, and the Company may fail to fully or effectively hedge its commodity  supply  and  price  risk.  In  addition,  these  activities,  although  intended  to  mitigate  price  volatility,  expose  the Company to other risks. When the Company sells or buys power or gas forward, it gives up the opportunity to buy or sell at the future price, which not only may result in lost opportunity costs but also may require the Company to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to its counterparties. The Company also relies on counterparty performance under its hedging agreements and is exposed to the credit quality of its counterparties under those agreements. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that the Company does not anticipate, or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract, it could harm the Company's business, operating results or financial position.\n\nNRG does not typically hedge the entire exposure of its operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent it does not hedge against commodity price volatility, the Company's results of operations and financial position may be improved or diminished based upon movement in commodity prices.\n\nNRG may engage in trading activities, including the trading of power, fuel and emissions allowances that are not directly related to the operation of the Company's generation facilities or the management of related risks. These trading activities take place in volatile markets and some of these trades could be characterized as speculative. The Company would expect to settle these trades financially rather than through the production of power or the delivery of fuel. This trading activity may expose the Company to the risk of significant financial losses which could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition.\n\nNRG generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative contracts. These derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value resulting from fluctuations in the underlying commodity prices immediately recognized in earnings, unless the derivative qualifies for",

        "page_content": "cash flow hedge accounting treatment or a scope exception. As a result, the Company's quarterly and annual results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by changes in market prices.\n\n## NRG may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  market  risks  through  its  retail  and  wholesale  operations,  which  involve  the  purchase  of electricity  and  natural  gas  for  resale,  the  sale  of  energy,  capacity  and  related  products,  and  the  purchase  and  sale  of  fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into energy and delivering energy to a buyer.\n\nNRG  undertakes  these  market  activities  through  agreements  with  various  counterparties.  Many  of  the  Company's agreements  with  counterparties  include  provisions  that  require  the  Company  to  provide  guarantees,  offset  or  netting arrangements, letters of credit, a first lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties against the risk of the Company's default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price  of  the  commodity  in  a  given  contract  and  the  market  price  of  the  commodity.  Significant  movements  in market prices can result in the Company being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of the Company's strategy may depend on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than the Company anticipates or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, the Company may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement its strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to the Company's counterparties may negatively affect the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\nFurther,  if  retail  customers  use  more  power  or  gas  than  expected,  or  if  any  of  NRG's  facilities  experience  unplanned outages,  the  Company  may  be  required  to  procure  additional  power  or  gas  at  spot  market  prices  to  fulfill  contractual commitments.  Without  adequate  liquidity  to  meet  margin  and  collateral  requirements,  the  Company  may  be  exposed  to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities, and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.\n\n## NRG relies on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which it does not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\n\nThe Company depends on natural gas pipelines and other transportation and storage facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. The Company's ability to provide natural gas for its present and projected customers will depend upon its suppliers' ability to obtain and deliver supplies of natural gas, as well as NRG's ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of the Company and its suppliers may affect the Company's ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties' control over  the  drilling  of  new  wells  and  the  facilities  to  transport  natural  gas  to  the  Company's  receipt  points,  development  of additional interstate pipeline infrastructure, availability of supply sources competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies and the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the U.S. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of the Company to sell and deliver its products and services may be hindered. As a result, the Company may be responsible for damages incurred by its customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. These conditions could have a material impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Operation of power generation facilities involves significant risks and hazards customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on NRG's revenues and results of operations, and NRG may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\n\nThe ongoing operation of NRG's facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and the inability to transport the Company's products to its customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled  outages  due  to  mechanical  failures  or  other  problems  occur  from  time  to  time  and  are  an  inherent  risk  of  the Company's business. Unplanned outages typically increase the Company's operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce the Company's revenues as a result of selling fewer MWh or incurring non-performance penalties and/or require NRG to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market or running one of its higher cost units to satisfy the Company's forward power sales obligations. NRG's inability to operate the Company's plants efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs, and generate earnings and cash flow from the Company's asset-based businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\n\nIn  addition,  NRG  provides  plant  operations  and  commercial  services  to  a  variety  of  third-parties.  There  is  a  risk  that mistakes, mis-operations, or actions taken by these third-parties could be attributed to NRG, including the risk of investigation",

        "page_content": "or penalties being assessed to NRG in connection with the services it offers, or that regulators could question whether NRG had the appropriate safeguards in place.\n\nPower  generation  involves  hazardous  activities,  including  acquiring,  transporting  and  unloading  fuel,  operating  large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, explosion, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in the Company's operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in NRG being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties.\n\nNRG  maintains  an  amount  of  insurance  protection  that  it  considers  adequate,  obtains  warranties  from  vendors  and obligates contractors to meet certain performance levels, but the Company cannot provide any assurance that these measures will  be  sufficient  or  effective  under  all  circumstances  and  against  all  hazards  or  liabilities  to  which  it  may  be  subject. A successful claim for which the Company is not fully insured or protected could hurt its financial results and materially harm NRG's financial condition. NRG cannot provide any assurance that its insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at  rates  or  on  terms  similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Supplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\n\nNRG often relies on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel, chemicals and other services required for the operation of certain of its facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, the Company utilizes the marketplace to provide these services. There can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide these services as, when and where required or at comparable prices.\n\nThe Company may also hedge a portion of its exposure to power and fuel price fluctuations through various physical or financial agreements with counterparties. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations,  and  in  case  of  renewable  generation,  such  counterparties  may  be  subject  to  additional  risks,  such  as  facility development and transmission risks, unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions, and mechanical or operational failures. NRG may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as its existing agreements, or at all. If the Company is unable to enter into  replacement  purchase  agreements  or  other  replacement  hedging  agreements,  the  Company would be exposed to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price.\n\nThe failure of any supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to NRG could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results. Consequently, the financial performance of the Company's facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers.\n\n## Maintenance,  expansion  and  refurbishment  of  power  generation  facilities  involve  significant  risks  that  could  result  in unplanned power outages or reduced output and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nNRG's  facilities  require  periodic  maintenance  and  repair.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures could result in reduced profitability.\n\nNRG cannot be certain of the level of capital expenditures that will be required due to changing environmental and safety laws (including changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof) needed facility repairs and unexpected events (such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks). The unexpected requirement of large capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## NRG and its subsidiaries have guaranteed the performance of third parties, which may result in substantial costs in the event of non-performance.\n\nNRG  and  its  subsidiaries  have  issued  certain  guarantees  of  the  performance  of  others,  which  obligate  NRG  and  its subsidiaries to perform in the event that the third parties do not perform. In the event of non-performance by the third parties, NRG could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligations under these guarantees. Such performance guarantees could have a material impact on the operating results, financial condition, or cash flows of the Company.\n\n## NRG  relies  on  power  transmission  and  distribution  facilities  that  it  does  not  own  or  control  and  that  are  subject  to transmission constraints within a number of the Company's core regions.\n\nNRG depends on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by others to deliver power to its customers. If  transmission  or  distribution  is  disrupted,  including  by  force  majeure  events,  or  if  the  transmission  or  distribution",

The  Company  also  cannot  predict whether transmission or distribution facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.\n\nIn  addition,  in  certain  of  the  markets  in  which  NRG  operates,  energy  transmission  congestion  may  occur  and  the Company may be deemed responsible for congestion costs associated with power sales or purchases, or retail sales, particularly where the Company's load is not co-located with its retail sales obligations. If NRG were liable for such congestion costs, the Company's financial results could be adversely affected.\n\n## Rates and terms for service of certain residential and commercial customers in Alberta are subject to regulatory review and approval.\n\nThe  Company  owns  Direct  Energy  Regulated  Services,  which  serves  as  a  regulated  rate  supplier  for  residential  and commercial energy customers in portions of the province of Alberta. It is required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as  a  part  of  the  process  of  establishing  the  terms  and  rates  for  sales  of  power  and  natural  gas.  These  proceedings  typically involve multiple parties,  including  governmental  bodies  and  officials,  consumer  advocacy  groups  and  various  consumers  of energy,  who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or even reducing rates. Decisions  are  subject  to  appeal,  potentially  leading  to  additional  uncertainty  associated  with  the  approval  proceedings.  The potential duration of such proceedings creates a risk that rates ultimately approved by the applicable regulatory body may not be sufficient  for  the  Company  to  recover  its  costs  by  the  time  the  rates  become  effective.  Established  rates  are  also  subject  to subsequent  reviews  by  regulators,  whereby  various  portions  of  rates  could  be  adjusted,  subject  to  refund  or  disallowed.  In certain instances, the Company could agree to negotiated settlements related to various rate matters and other cost recovery elements. These settlements are subject to regulatory approval. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings have a significant effect on the Company to recover its costs or earn an adequate return. In addition, subsequent legislative or regulatory  action  could  alter  the  terms  on  which  the  regulated  business  operates  and  future  earnings  could  be  negatively impacted. The Company also operates a competitive energy supply business in Alberta that is not subject to rate regulation and is  subject  to  stringent  requirements  to  segregate  operations  and  information  relating  to  the  competitive  business  from  the regulated business. Failure to comply with these and other requirements on the business could subject the Company's regulated and competitive businesses in Alberta to fines, penalties, and restrictions on the ability to continue business.\n\n## Because NRG owns less than a majority of the ownership interests of some of its project investments, the Company cannot exercise complete control over their operations.\n\nNRG  has  limited  control  over  the  operation  of  some  project  investments  and  joint  ventures  because  the  Company's investments are in projects where it beneficially owns less than a majority of the ownership interests. NRG seeks to exert a degree  of  influence  with  respect  to  the  management  and  operation  of  projects  in  which  it  owns  less  than  a  majority  of  the ownership  interests  by  negotiating  to  obtain  positions  on  management  committees  or  to  receive  certain  limited  governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, the Company may not always succeed in such negotiations. NRG may  be  dependent  on  its  co-venturers  to  operate  such  projects.  The  Company's  co-venturers  may  not  have  the  level  of experience, technical expertise, human resources management or other attributes necessary to operate these projects optimally. The approval of co-venturers also may be required for NRG to receive distributions of funds from projects or to transfer the Company's interest in projects.\n\n## NRG may be unable to integrate the operations of acquired entities in the manner expected.\n\nNRG enters into acquisitions that result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions depends on whether the businesses can be integrated into NRG in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of  valuable  employees,  the  disruption  of  NRG's  businesses,  processes  and  systems  or  inconsistencies  in  standards,  controls, procedures,  practices,  policies  and  compensation  arrangements,  any  of  which  could  divert  the  attention  of  management  and adversely  affect  the  Company's  ability  to  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the  acquisitions.  NRG  may  have  difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could  result  in  increased  costs  or  decreases  in  the  amount  of  expected  revenues  and  could  adversely  affect  NRG's  future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\n\n## Future acquisition or disposition activities could involve unknown risks and may have materially adverse effects and NRG may be subject to trailing liabilities from businesses that it disposes of or that are inactive.\n\nNRG may in the future acquire or dispose of businesses or assets, acquire or sell books of retail customers, or pursue other business activities, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, that involve a number of risks. The acquisition of companies and assets is subject to substantial risks, including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets or customers, the ability to retain customers and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired. Further, the integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other",

In the case of dispositions, such risks may relate to employment matters, counterparties, regulators and other stakeholders in the disposed business, risks relating to separating  the  disposed  assets  from  NRG's  business,  risks  related  to  the  management  of  NRG's  ongoing  business,  risks unknown to NRG at the time, and other financial, legal and operational risks related to such disposition. In addition, NRG may be subject to material trailing liabilities from disposed businesses. Any such risk may result in one or more costly disputes or litigation.  There  can  be  no  assurances  that  any  future  acquisitions  will  perform  as  expected  or  that  the  returns  from  such acquisitions will support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them. There can also be no assurances that NRG will realize the anticipated benefits from any such dispositions. The failure to realize the anticipated returns or benefits from an acquisition or disposition could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n## Risks that are beyond NRG's control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or related acts of war, natural disaster, hostile cyber intrusions, data breaches or other catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nNRG's generation facilities and the facilities of third parties on which they rely may be targets of terrorist activities, as well  as  events  occurring  in  response  to  or  in  connection  with  such  activities,  all  of  which  could  cause  environmental repercussions  and/or  result  in  full  or  partial  disruption  of  the  facilities  ability  to  generate,  transmit,  transport  or  distribute electricity or natural gas. Strategic targets, such as energy-related facilities, may be at greater risk of future terrorist activities than  other  domestic  targets.  Any  such  environmental  repercussions  or  disruption  could  result  in  a  significant  decrease  in revenues or significant reconstruction or remediation costs beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, significant  weather  events  or  terrorist  actions  could  damage  or  shut  down  the  power  or  gas  transmission  and  distribution facilities upon which the Company is dependent, which may reduce retail volume for extended periods of time. Power or gas supply may be sold at a loss if these events cause a significant loss of retail customer demand.\n\nNumerous  functions  affecting  the  efficient  operation  of  NRG's  businesses  depend  on  the  secure  and  reliable  storage, processing and communication of electronic data and the use of sophisticated computer hardware and software systems. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems, as well as electronic control systems used at the generation facilities and for the distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as  well  as  significant  expense  to  repair  security  breaches  or  system  damage.  The  operation  of  NRG's  generation  plants, including STP, and of NRG's energy and fuel trading businesses rely on cyber-based technologies and, therefore, are subject to the  risk  that  such  systems  could  be  the  target  of  disruptive  actions,  particularly  through  cyber-attack  or  cyber  intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, or otherwise be compromised by unintentional events. As a result, operations could be interrupted, property could be damaged and sensitive customer information could be lost or stolen, causing NRG to incur significant losses of revenues, other substantial liabilities and damages, costs to replace or repair damaged equipment and damage to NRG's reputation. In addition, NRG may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its cyber systems and plants.\n\nIn addition, the Company requires access to sensitive data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data, credit and debit card account numbers, driver's license numbers, social security numbers and bank account information. NRG provides  sensitive  data  to  vendors  and  service  providers,  who  require  access  to  this  information  in  order  to  provide services  to  NRG,  such  as  call  center  operations.  If  a  significant  breach  occurs  or  if  sensitive  data  that  was  entrusted  to  the Company were mishandled, the reputation of NRG and its businesses may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished,  or  NRG  and  its  retail  operations  may  be  subject  to  legal  claims,  any  of  which  may  contribute  to  the  loss  of customers and have a negative impact on the business and/or results of operations.\n\n## The  Company has made investments,  and  may  continue  to  make  investments,  in  new  business  initiatives  predominantly focused on consumer products and in markets that may not be successful, may not achieve the intended financial results or may result in product liability and reputational risk that could adversely affect the Company.\n\nNRG continues to pursue growth in its existing businesses and markets and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain. Such initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current  operations,  inadequate  return  on  capital,  and  unidentified  issues  not  discovered  in  the  diligence  performed  prior  to launching an initiative or entering a market.\n\nAs  part  of  these  initiatives,  the  Company  may  be  liable  to  customers  for  any  damage  caused  to  customers'  homes, facilities, belongings or property during the installation of Company products and systems, such as home back-up generators and residential HVAC system repairs, installation and replacements. Where such work is performed by independent contractors, such as repairs performed under the Company's home warranty and protection plan products, the Company may nonetheless face  claims  and  costs  for  damage.

The  products  that  the  Company  sells  or  manufactures  may  expose  the  Company  to product liability claims relating to personal injury, death, or environmental or property damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Although the Company maintains liability insurance, the Company cannot be certain that its coverage will be adequate  for  liabilities  actually  incurred  or  that  insurance  will  continue  to  be  available  to  the  Company  on  economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, any product liability claim or damage caused by the Company could significantly impair the Company's brand  and  reputation,  which  may  result  in  a  failure  to  maintain  customers  and  achieve  the  Company's  desired growth initiatives in these new businesses.\n\n## Changes in technology may impair the value of NRG's power plants and the attractiveness of its retail products, and the Company may potentially be affected by emerging technologies that may over time affect change in capacity markets and the energy industry overall with the inclusion of distributed generation and clean technology.\n\nResearch and development activities are ongoing in the industry to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to produce  power,  including  wind,  photovoltaic  (solar)  cells,  hydrogen,  energy  storage,  and  improvements  in  traditional technologies and equipment, such as more efficient gas turbines. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the costs of power production to a level below what the Company has currently forecasted, which could adversely affect its cash flows, results of operations or competitive position. Technology, including distributed technology or changes in retail rate structures, may also have a material impact on the Company's ability to retain retail customers.\n\nSome emerging technologies,  such  as  distributed  renewable  energy  technologies,  broad  consumer  adoption  of  electric vehicles and energy storage devices, could affect the price of energy. These emerging technologies may affect the financial viability of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on NRG's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## NRG's business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages by its unionized employees or inability to replace employees as they retire.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 13% of NRG's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the event that the Company's union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strife or disruption, NRG would be responsible for procuring replacement labor or the Company could experience reduced power  generation  or  outages.  Although  NRG's  ability  to  procure  such  labor  is  uncertain,  contingency  staffing  planning  is completed as part of each respective contract negotiations. Strikes, work stoppages or the inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, a number of the Company's employees at NRG's plants are close to retirement. The Company's inability to replace retiring workers could create potential knowledge and expertise gaps as such workers retire.\n\n## Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Laws\n\nNRG's  business  is  subject  to  substantial  energy  regulation  and  may  be  adversely  affected  by  legislative  or  regulatory changes,  as  well  as  liability  under,  or  any  future  inability  to  comply  with,  existing  or  future  energy  regulations  or requirements.\n\nNRG's business is subject to extensive U.S. federal, state and local laws and foreign laws. Compliance with, or changes to, the requirements under these legal regimes may cause the Company to incur significant additional costs, reduce the Company's ability  to  hedge  exposure  or  to  sell  retail  power  within  certain  states  or  to  certain  classes  of  retail  customers,  or  restrict  the Company's marketing practices, its ability to pass through costs to retail customers, or its ability to compete on favorable terms with competitors, including the incumbent utility. Retail competition and home warranty services are regulated on a state-bystate or at the province-by-province level and are highly dependent on state and provincial laws, regulations and policies, which could  change  at  any  moment.  Failure  to  comply  with  such  requirements  could  result  in  the  shutdown  of  a  non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines, and/or civil or criminal liability.\n\nPublic  utilities  under  the  FPA  are  required  to  obtain  FERC  acceptance  of  their  rate  schedules  for  wholesale  sales  of electricity.  Except  for  ERCOT  generation  facilities  and  power  marketers,  all  of  NRG's  non-qualifying  facility  generating companies and power marketing affiliates in the U.S. make sales of electricity in interstate commerce and are public utilities for purposes  of  the  FPA.  FERC  has  granted  each  of  NRG's  generating  and  power  marketing  companies  that  make  sales  of electricity outside of ERCOT the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. FERC's orders that grant NRG's generating and  power  marketing  companies  market-based  rate  authority  reserve  the  right  to  revoke  or  revise  that  authority  if  FERC subsequently determines that NRG can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, NRG's market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of NRG's generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated those rules, they are subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If NRG's generating and power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain FERC's acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-",

        "page_content": "keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have a material adverse effect on the rates NRG charges for power from its facilities.\n\nSubstantially  all  of  the  Company's  generation  assets  are  also  subject  to  the  reliability  standards  promulgated  by  the designated  Electric  Reliability  Organization  (currently  NERC)  and  approved  by  FERC.  If  NRG  fails  to  comply  with  the mandatory  reliability  standards,  NRG  could  be  subject  to  sanctions,  including  substantial  monetary  penalties  and  increased compliance obligations. NRG is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations, and bidding rules that occur in the existing ISOs. The ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power  markets  impose,  and  in  the  future  may  continue  to  impose,  mitigation,  including  price  limitations,  offer  caps,  nonperformance penalties and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these  markets.  These  types  of  price  limitations  and  other  regulatory  mechanisms  may  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the profitability of NRG's generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets.\n\nThe regulatory environment has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting wholesale and retail competition and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable generation and, in some cases, transmission. These changes are ongoing, and the Company cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on NRG's business. In addition,  in  some  of  these  markets,  interested  parties  have  proposed  material  market  design  changes.  If  competitive restructuring  of  the  electric  power  markets  is  reversed,  discontinued,  or  delayed,  the  Company's  business  prospects  and financial results could be negatively impacted. In addition, since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets, both in the United States and internationally. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption  of  additional  regulations,  including  any  regulations  relating  to  position  limits  on  futures  and  other  derivatives  or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact NRG's ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among  other  things,  potentially  decreasing  liquidity  in  the  forward  commodity  and  derivatives  markets  or  limiting  NRG's ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.\n\n## NRG's business may be affected by interference in the competitive wholesale marketplace.\n\nNRG's  generation  and  competitive  retail  operations  rely  on  a  competitive  wholesale  marketplace.  The  competitive wholesale marketplace may be impacted by out-of-market subsidies, including bailouts of uneconomic nuclear plants, imports of power from Canada, renewable mandates or subsidies, mandates to sell power below its cost of acquisition and associated costs,  as  well  as  out-of-market  payments  to  new  or  existing  generators.  These  out-of-market  subsidies  to  existing  or  new generation  undermine  the  competitive  wholesale  marketplace,  which  can  lead  to  premature  retirement  of  existing  facilities, including those owned by the Company. If these measures continue, capacity and energy prices may be suppressed, and the Company may not be successful in its efforts to insulate the competitive market from this interference. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and operate facilities that could be provided by competitive market participants.\n\n## The integration of the Capacity Performance product into the PJM market could lead to substantial changes in capacity income  and  non-performance  penalties,  which  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  results  of  operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nPJM  operates  a  pay-for-performance  model  where  capacity  payments  are  modified  based  on  real-time  generator performance.  Capacity  market  prices  are  sensitive  to  design  parameters,  as  well  as  additions  of  new  capacity.  NRG  may experience substantial changes in capacity income and non-performance penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## NRG's ownership interest in a nuclear power facility subjects the Company to regulations, costs and liabilities  uniquely associated with these types of facilities.\n\nUnder the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, or AEA, ownership and operation of STP, of which NRG indirectly owns a 44% interest, is subject to regulation by the NRC. Such regulation includes licensing, inspection, enforcement, testing, evaluation  and  modification  of  all  aspects  of  nuclear  reactor  power  plant  design  and  operation,  environmental  and  safety performance,  technical  and  financial  qualifications,  decommissioning  funding  assurance  and  transfer  and  foreign  ownership restrictions. The current facility operating licenses for STP expire on August 20, 2047 (Unit 1) and December 15, 2048 (Unit 2).\n\nThere are unique risks to owning and operating a nuclear power facility. These include liabilities related to the handling, treatment, storage, disposal, transport, release and use of radioactive materials, particularly with respect to spent nuclear fuel, and uncertainties regarding the ultimate, and potential exposure to, technical and financial risks associated with modifying or decommissioning a nuclear facility. The NRC could require the shutdown of the plant for safety reasons or refuse to permit restart of the unit after unplanned or planned outages. New or amended NRC safety and regulatory requirements may give rise to additional operation and maintenance costs and capital expenditures. Additionally, aging equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic",

        "page_content": "upgrading  and  improvement.  Any  unexpected  failure,  including  failure  associated  with  breakdowns,  forced  outages,  or  any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. STP will be obligated to continue storing spent nuclear fuel if the U.S. DOE continues to fail to meet its contractual obligations to STP made pursuant to the U.S. Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept and dispose of STP's spent nuclear fuel. Costs associated with these risks could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on NRG's results of operations, financial condition or cash flow to the extent not covered by the Decommissioning Trusts or recovered from ratepayers. In addition, to the extent that all or a part of STP is required by the NRC to permanently or temporarily shut down or modify its operations, or is otherwise subject to a forced outage, NRG may incur additional costs to the extent it is obligated to provide power from more expensive alternative sources - either NRG's own plants, third party generators or the ERCOT - to cover the Company's then existing forward sale obligations. Such shutdown or modification could also lead to substantial costs related to the storage and disposal of radioactive materials and spent nuclear fuel.\n\nWhile STP maintains property and liability insurance for losses related to nuclear operations, there may be limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available. See also Item 15 -Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies , Nuclear Insurance .  An  accident  at  STP  or  another  nuclear  facility  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  NRG's  financial condition, its operational results, or liquidity as losses may exceed the insurance coverage available and/or may result in the obligation to pay retrospective premium obligations.\n\nNRG is subject  to  environmental  laws  that  impose  extensive  and  increasingly  stringent  requirements  on  the  Company's ongoing  operations,  as  well  as  potentially  substantial  liabilities  arising  out  of  environmental  contamination.  These environmental requirements and liabilities could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nNRG is subject to the environmental laws of foreign and U.S., federal, state and local authorities. The Company must comply with numerous environmental laws and obtain numerous governmental permits and approvals to build and operate the Company's plants. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time. Should NRG fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to its operations, the Company could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions seeking to curtail the Company's operations. In  addition,  when  new  requirements  take  effect  or  when  existing  environmental  requirements  are  revised,  reinterpreted  or subject to changing enforcement policies, NRG's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\n\nNRG's businesses are subject to physical, market and economic risks relating to potential effects of climate change, and policies at the national, regional and state levels to regulate GHG emissions and mitigate climate change could adversely impact NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nFluctuations in weather and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for electricity or natural gas. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events, could disrupt NRG's operations and supply chain, and cause it  to  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  effects.  These  or  other  changes  in  climate  could  lead  to increased operating costs or capital expenses. NRG's customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change  and  may  incur  significant  costs  in  preparing  for  or  responding  to  these  efforts,  including  increasing  the  mix  and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply.\n\nHazards customary to the power production industry include the potential for unusual weather conditions, which could affect fuel pricing and availability, the Company's route to market or access to customers, i.e., transmission and distribution lines, transportation and delivery, or critical plant assets. The contribution of climate change to the frequency or intensity of weather-related events could affect NRG's operations and planning process.\n\nClimate change could also affect the availability of a secure and economical supply of water in some locations, which is essential for the continued operation of NRG's generation plants. NRG monitors water risk carefully. If it is determined that a water  supply  risk  exists  that  could  impact  projected  generation  levels  at  any  plant  risk  mitigation  efforts  are  identified  and evaluated for implementation.\n\nFurther,  demand  for  NRG's  energy-related  services  could  be  similarly  impacted  by  consumers'  preferences  or  market factors favoring energy efficiency, low-carbon power sources or reduced electricity usage.\n\nNRG's GHG emissions for 2021 can be found in Item 1, Business -Environmental Regulatory Matters. GHG regulation, at  the  state  or  federal  level,  could  increase  the  cost  of  electricity  generated  by  fossil  fuels,  and  such  increases  could  reduce demand for the power NRG generates and markets. Any increase in costs at a national, regional or state level could adversely affect NRG's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows",

        "page_content": "## Changes in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any non-compliance with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect NRG's business and financial results.\n\nThe consumer privacy landscape continues to experience momentum for greater privacy protection and reform at the state and federal level in response to precedents set forth by the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"). The development and evolving nature of domestic and international privacy regulation and  enforcement  could  impact  and  potentially  limit  how  NRG  processes  personally  identifiable  information.  The  2020 enactment of the CCPA granted certain data access rights to California residents with respect to their personal information, and with  the  forthcoming  amendments  to  the  CCPA  supported  by  the  California  Privacy  Rights  Act  (the  'CPRA'),  effective January 1, 2023, California residents will have increased access rights (including the right to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information), which will be enforced by a new state privacy regulator, resulting in more scrutiny of business practices  and  disclosures.  Additional  states  including  Virginia,  Colorado,  and  Nevada  have  similarly  adopted  enhanced  data privacy legislation patterned after the standards set forth by CCPA, including broader data access rights, with Virginia going a step further requiring businesses to perform data protection assessments for certain processing activities.\n\nAs new laws and regulations are created, requiring businesses to implement processes to enable customer access to their data  and  enhanced  data  protection  and  management  standards,  NRG  cannot  forecast  the  impact  that  they  may  have  on  the Company's  business.  Any  non-compliance  with  laws  may  result  in  proceedings  or  actions  against  the  Company  by governmental  entities  or  individuals.  Moreover,  any  inquiries  or  investigations,  government  penalties  or  sanctions,  or  civil actions  by  individuals  may  be  costly  to  comply  with,  resulting  in  negative  publicity,  increased  operating  costs,  significant management time and attention,  and  may  lead  to  remedies  that  harm  the  business,  including  fines,  demands  or  orders  that existing business practices be modified or terminated.\n\n## NRG's retail operations are subject to changing rules and regulations that could have a material impact on the Company's profitability.\n\nThe competitiveness of NRG's retail operations partially depends on regulatory policies that establish the structure, rules, terms and conditions on which services are offered to retail customers. These policies can include, among other things, controls on the retail rates that NRG can charge, the imposition of additional costs on sales, restrictions on the Company's ability to obtain new customers through various marketing channels and disclosure requirements. The Company's retail operations may be materially impacted by rules or regulations that allow regulated utilities to participate in competitive retail markets or own and  operate  facilities  that  could  be  provided  by  competitive  market  participants.  Additionally,  state,  federal  or  provincial imposition of net metering or RPS programs can make it more or less expensive for retail customers to supplement or replace their reliance on grid power.\n\n## The  Company's  international  operations  are  exposed  to  political  and  economic  risks,  commercial  instability  and  events beyond  the  Company's  control  in  the  countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  risks  may  negatively  impact  the  Company's business.\n\nThe  Company's  international  operations  depend  on  products  manufactured,  purchased  and  sold  in  the  U.S.  and internationally.  In  some  cases,  these  countries  have  greater  political  and  economic  volatility  and  greater  vulnerability  to infrastructure and labor disruptions than in NRG's other markets. Operating a business in a number of different regions and countries  exposes  the  Company  to  a  number  of  risks,  including:  multiple  and  potentially  conflicting  laws,  regulations  and policies that are subject to change; imposition of currency restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints; imposition of  burdensome  tariffs  or  quotas;  national  and  international  conflict,  including  terrorist  acts;  and  political  and  economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.\n\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risks Related to Public Health Threats\n\n## Public  health  threats  or  outbreaks  of  communicable  diseases  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's operations and financial results .\n\nThe  Company  may  face  risks  related  to  public  health  threats  or  outbreaks  of  communicable  diseases.  A  widespread healthcare  crisis,  such  as  an  outbreak  of  a  communicable  disease,  could  adversely  affect  the  global  economy  and  the Company's  ability  to  conduct  its  business  for  an  indefinite  period  of  time.  For  example,  the  ongoing  global  COVID-19 pandemic  negatively  impacted  local  and  global  economies,  disrupted  financial  markets  and  international  trade,  resulted  in increased  unemployment  levels  and  impacted  local  and  global  supply  chains,  all  of  which  negatively  impact  the  electricity industry  and  the  Company's  business.  Federal,  state,  and  local  governments  had  implemented  various  mitigation  measures, including  travel  restrictions,  border  closings,  restrictions  on  public  gatherings,  shelter-in-place  orders  and  limitations  on business activities. Although the operations of the Company are considered an essential service, some of these measures may adversely  impact  the  ability  of  NRG  employees,  contractors,  suppliers,  customers,  and  other  business  partners  to  conduct",

This could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\nIn particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus could:\n\n- \u00b7 adversely impact demand for the Company's electricity services and other products and services and the ability of customers to pay their bills;\n- \u00b7 cause an increase in costs for  the  Company as a result  of  emergency  measures  taken  by  state  and  local  regulatory authorities in response to the COVID-19 crisis, including regulatory changes prohibiting customer disconnects and late fees;\n- \u00b7 impact  the  ability  of  the  Company's  partners  or  counterparties  to  perform  their  obligations  under  existing arrangements, including development projects, power purchase and sale arrangements, hedging arrangements or other commercial activities; and\n- \u00b7 cause other unpredicted events which may have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\nThe situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the potential for a material impact on the Company's results of operations, financial condition, risk exposure and liquidity increases the longer the virus, or any variants thereof, impacts the level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. NRG cannot reasonably estimate with any degree of certainty the future  impact  of  COVID-19,  or  any  resurgence  of  COVID-19  or  other  pandemic  may  have  on  the  Company's  results  of operations, financial position, risk exposure and liquidity.\n\n## Risks Related to the Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and the Company's Indebtedness\n\nNRG's level  of  indebtedness  could  adversely  affect  its  ability  to  raise  additional  capital  to  fund  its  operations  or  return capital to stockholders. It could also expose it to the risk of increased interest rates and limit its ability to react to changes in the economy or its industry.\n\nNRG's substantial debt could have negative consequences, including:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing NRG's vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n- \u00b7 requiring a substantial portion of NRG's cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, therefore reducing NRG's ability to pay dividends or to use its cash flow to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n- \u00b7 limiting NRG's ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors who have less debt; and\n- \u00b7 exposing NRG to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of its borrowings are at variable rates of interest, primarily through its Revolving Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company's credit documents contain financial and other restrictive covenants that may limit the Company's ability to return  capital  to  stockholders  or  otherwise  engage  in  activities  that  may  be  in  its  long-term  best  interests.  NRG's  failure  to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all  of  the  Company's  indebtedness.  The  Company's  corporate  credit  agreement  includes  a  sustainability-linked  metric  and sustainability-linked bonds, which could result in increased interest expense to the Company if the sustainability metrics set forth therein are not met. Furthermore, financial and other restrictive covenants contained in any project level subsidiary debt may limit the ability of NRG to receive distributions from such subsidiary.\n\nIn addition, NRG's ability to arrange financing, either at the corporate level, a non-recourse project-level subsidiary or otherwise, and the costs of such capital, are dependent on numerous factors, including: general economic and capital market conditions;  credit  availability  from  banks  and  other  financial  institutions;  investor  confidence  in  NRG,  its  partners  and  the regional wholesale power markets; NRG's financial performance and the financial performance of its subsidiaries; NRG's level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements; maintenance of acceptable credit ratings; cash flow; and provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\n\nNRG may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. The failure to obtain additional capital from time to time may have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.",

A discussion and analysis of fiscal year 2019 may be found in Part II, Item 7 -Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nAs further described in Item 15 -Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company determined in prior years that the following businesses were discontinued operations and recast to present their results in the corporate segment:\n\n- \u00b7 South Central Portfolio\n- \u00b7 NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform\n- \u00b7 Carlsbad\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and  Canada  in  a  manner  that  delivers  value  to  all  of  NRG's  stakeholders.  NRG  sells  power,  natural  gas,  home  and  power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 6 million Home  customers  as  well  as  commercial,  industrial,  and  wholesale  customers,  supported  by  approximately  18,000  MW  of generation as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Business Environment\n\nThe industry dynamics and external influences affecting the Company, its businesses, and the retail energy and power generation industry in 2021 and for the future medium term include:\n\nMarket Dynamics -  The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates. Natural gas prices are driven by variables including demand from the industrial, residential, and electric sectors, productivity across natural gas supply basins, costs of natural gas production, changes in pipeline infrastructure, and the financial and hedging profile of natural gas customers and producers. In 2021, the average natural gas price at Henry Hub was 85% higher than in 2020.\n\nNRG may experience impacts to gross margins due to significant, rapid changes in current natural gas prices and the lag in our ability to make a corresponding adjustment to the retail rates we charge customers on term and month to month contracts. The Company hedges its load commitments in order to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, and as a result, these gross margin impacts would be realized in future periods until we are able to make the corresponding adjustments to the retail customer rates.\n\nNatural gas prices are a primary driver of coal demand. Coal commodity prices increased significantly in 2021, which is partly due to supply chain disruptions, as further discussed below in Global Supply Chain Disruptions , as well as stressed coal equities,  which  has  led  coal  suppliers  to  file  for  bankruptcy  protection,  launch  debt  exchanges,  rationalize  assets,  and  cut production.",

        "page_content": "Electricity Prices - The price of electricity is a key determinant of the profitability of the Company. Many variables such as the price of different fuels, weather, load growth and unit availability all coalesce to impact the final price for electricity and the  Company's  profitability.  An  increase  in  supply  cost  volatility  in  the  competitive  retail  markets  may  result  in  smaller companies choosing to exit the market, which may result in further consolidation in the competitive retail space. The following table  summarizes average on-peak power prices for each of the major markets in which NRG operates for the years ended December  31,  2021  and  2020.  The  average  on-peak  power  prices  increased  significantly  in  Texas  due  to  the  impact  from Winter  Storm  Uri.  The  average  on-peak  power  prices  increased  in  East  and  West/Services/Other  due  to  higher  natural  gas prices.\n\n|                                                                                             | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   | Average On-Peak Power Price ($/MWh)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                             | Year Ended December 31,               | Year Ended December 31,               | 2021 vs 2020                          |\n| Region                                                                                      | 2021                                  | 2020                                  | Change %                              |\n| Texas  (a)                                                                                  |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| ERCOT -

Intercompany financial transactions hedging generation with the retail operations make up ($8.03)/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2021 and $12.18/MWh in the year ended December 31, 2020\n\nThe average realized power prices increased less than average on peak power prices for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, due to the Company's multi-year hedging program impacting average realized power  prices,  while  on  peak  power  prices  increased  due  to  increased  natural  gas  prices  and  warmer  June  temperatures  in California.\n\nIncreased Awareness of, and Action to Combat, Climate Change - Diverse groups of stakeholders, including investors, asset  managers,  financial  institutions,  non-government  organizations,  industry  coalitions,  individual  companies,  consumer groups and academic institutions, are increasingly engaged in efforts to limit global warming in the post-industrial era to well below  2  degrees  Celsius.  As  a  result,  policymakers  and  regulators  at  regional,  national,  sub-national  and  local  levels  of government,  both  in  the  United  States  and  other  parts  of  the  world,  are  increasingly  focused  on  actions  to  combat  climate change.\n\nNRG actively monitors climate change related developments that could impact its business and regularly engages with a diverse set of stakeholders on these issues. Such engagement helps the Company identify and pursue potential opportunities both to decarbonize its business and better serve its customers. NRG is committed to providing transparent disclosures of its climate risks and opportunities to stakeholders. The Company became an early supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") recommendations after they were issued in 2017, published a TCFD mapping disclosure in December 2020 and issued a stand-alone TCFD report in December 2021.",

        "page_content": "Lower Carbon Infrastructure Development - Policy mechanisms at the state and federal level, including production and investment tax credits, cash grants, loan guarantees, accelerated depreciation tax benefits, RPS, and carbon trading plans, have supported  and  continue  to  support  the  development  of  renewable  generation,  demand-side  and  smart  grid,  and  other  lower carbon infrastructure technologies. In addition, the costs associated with the development of lower carbon infrastructure, such as  wind  and  solar  generating  facilities,  continue  to  decline.  These  factors  continue  to  drive  increases  in  the  development  of lower carbon infrastructure in the markets where the Company participates, which may impact the ability of the Company's generating facilities to participate in those markets. According to ERCOT, 39% of 2021 energy consumption in the ERCOT market  was  generated  from  carbon  emission-free  resources,  with  wind  power  contributing  24%.  In  addition,  subsidies  and incentives have contributed to the increase in renewable power sources, and customer awareness and preferences are shifting toward  sustainable  solutions.  Increased  demand  for  sustainable  energy  products  from  both  residential  and  commercial customers creates opportunities for diversified product offerings in competitive retail markets.\n\nDigitization and Customization -  The electric industry is experiencing major technology changes in the way power is distributed  and  used  by  end-use  customers.  The  electric  grid  is  shifting  from  a  centralized  analog  system,  where  power  is generated  from  limited  sources  and  flows  in  one  direction,  to  a  decentralized  multidirectional  system,  where  power  can  be generated from a number of distributed resources and stored or dispatched on an as-needed basis. In addition, customers are seeking new ways to engage with their power providers. Technologies like smart thermostats, appliances and electric vehicles are giving individuals more choice and control over their electricity usage.\n\nWeather -  Weather  conditions  in  the  regions  of  the  U.S.  in  which  NRG  conducts  business  influence  the  Company's financial  results.  Weather  conditions  can  affect  the  supply  and  demand  for  electricity  and  fuels  and  may  also  impact  the availability of the Company's generating assets. Changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot and forward markets, which may affect the Company's results in any given period. Typically, demand for and the price of electricity is higher in the summer and the winter seasons, when temperatures are more extreme. The demand for and price of natural gas is also generally higher in the winter. However, all regions of the U.S. typically do not experience  extreme  weather  conditions  at  the  same  time,  thus  NRG's  operations  are  typically  not  exposed  to  the  effects  of extreme weather in all parts of its business at once. A significant portion of the Company's business is located within Texas, and extreme weather conditions occurring in Texas may have a material impact on the Company's financial position.\n\nFor discussion of the recent weather event in Texas, see Significant Events - Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021 and expected Uplift Securitization Proceeds below.\n\nGlobal Supply Chain Disruptions There are currently global supply chain disruptions impacting natural gas, coal and other  fuels  and  materials  necessary  for  the  production  and  sale  of  electricity  to  our  retail  customers.  These  supply  chain disruptions are due in part to increased demand driven by a number of factors outside the Company's control including the COVID-19 pandemic, labor  shortages  and  extreme  weather  events  in  the  U.S.  These  factors  are  impacting  the  dispatch  of generation  facilities,  as  well  as  the  costs  to  serve  our  retail  customers.  The  Company  expects  supply  chain  disruptions  will continue throughout the remainder of 2022. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts of these events. We will continue to actively monitor all direct and indirect potential impacts of the supply chain disruptions, and will seek to mitigate and minimize their impact on our business.\n\nOther  Factors -  A  number  of  other  factors  significantly  influence  the  level  and  volatility  of  prices  for  energy commodities and related derivative products for NRG's business. These factors include:\n\n- \u00b7 seasonal, daily and hourly changes in demand;\n- \u00b7 extreme peak demands;\n- \u00b7 available supply resources;\n- \u00b7 transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions;\n- \u00b7 location of NRG's generating facilities relative to the location of its load-serving opportunities;\n- \u00b7 procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions; and\n- \u00b7 changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations.\n\nThese factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees. These effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in:\n\n- \u00b7 weather conditions;\n- \u00b7 market liquidity;\n- \u00b7 capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems;\n- \u00b7 local transportation systems; and\n- \u00b7 the nature and extent of electricity deregulation.",

Details of regulatory matters are presented in Item 15 -  Note 24, Regulatory Matters , to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1 -Business, Regulatory  Matters .  Details  of  legal  proceedings  are  presented  in  Item  15  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies , to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of this information relates to costs that may be material to the Company's financial results.\n\n## Significant Events\n\nThe  following  significant  events  occurred  during  2021  and  through  the  filing  date,  as  further  described  within  this Management's Discussion and Analysis and the consolidated financial statements:\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the Company issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount at par of 3.875% senior notes due 2032 (the \"2032 Senior Notes\"). The 2032 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. The 2032 Senior Notes were issued under NRG's Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2032 Senior Notes from and including August 15, 2026.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company redeemed $1.9 billion in aggregate principal of its Senior Notes for $1.9 billion using the proceeds of the 2032 Senior Notes and cash on hand.\n\n## Extreme Weather Event in Texas During February 2021 and expected Uplift Securitization proceeds\n\nDuring February 2021, Texas experienced unprecedented cold temperatures for a prolonged duration as a result of Winter Storm Uri, resulting in a power emergency, blackouts, and an estimated all-time peak demand of 77 GW (without load shed). Ahead of the event, NRG launched residential customer communications calling for conservation across all of its brands, and initiated  residential  and  commercial  and  industrial  demand  response  programs  to  curtail  customer  load.  The  Company maximized available generating capacity and brought in additional resources to supplement in-state staff with technical and operating experts from the rest of its U.S. fleet.\n\nThe Texas Legislature passed House Bill 4492, which among other things, authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT exceptionally highly priced ORDPA and ancillary service costs during Winter Storm Uri. Based on LSE-level detail published by the PUCT on December 7, 2021, NRG will receive $689 million from ERCOT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Winter Storm Uri's pre-tax financial impact to the Company was a loss of $380 million, which reflects the recovery of $689 million of cost of operations as a result of the proceeds we will receive from the  Uplift  Securitization  discussed  above,  with  receipt  expected  to  occur  during  the  second  quarter  of  2022.  The  Company continues  to  pursue  additional  mitigants  including,  but  not  limited  to,  customer  bad  debt  mitigation,  counterparty  default recovery, and additional ERCOT default recovery.\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in  North  America,  with  operations  in  all  50  U.S.  states  and  8  Canadian  provinces.  The  acquisition  increased  NRG's  retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and complements its integrated model. It also broadened the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it did not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business. See Item 15 -Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n## Limestone Extended Outage\n\nIn early July 2021, Limestone Unit 1 came offline as a result of damage to the duct work associated with the flue gas desulfurization  system.  Based  on  management's  current  assessment  of  necessary  remediation  efforts,  Limestone  Unit  1  is expected to remain on an outage until the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## PJM Base Residual Auction results and Planned Retirement of 1,600 MWs of PJM Coal Capacity\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year were released, leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM coal generating assets in June 2022. On July 30, 2021, PJM identified reliability impacts resulting from the proposed deactivation of one of those assets, Indian River Unit 4. On August 27, 2021 the Company notified PJM that it would continue operations at Indian River Unit 4 until the reliability upgrades identified by PJM were completed, provided that the unit receives a satisfactory and compensatory 'reliability must run' arrangement.",

        "page_content": "The Company recorded impairment losses of $271 million and $35 million on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively, in connection with the decline in PJM capacity prices and the near-term retirement dates of certain assets. See Item 15 -Note 11, Asset Impairments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company is continuing to evaluate the viability of the remaining PJM generating assets.\n\n## Sale of 4.8 GW of Fossil Generation Assets\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company sold approximately 4,850 MWs of fossil generating assets from its East and West regions of operations to Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into  a  tolling  agreement  for  the  866  MW  Arthur  Kill  plant  in  New  York  City  through  April  2025.  See  Item  15 -Note  4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\n## Sale of Agua Caliente\n\nOn February 3, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its 35% ownership in Agua Caliente to Clearway Energy, Inc. for $202 million. NRG recognized a gain on the sale of $17 million, including cash disposed of $7 million.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nIn December 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase $1.0 billion of its common stock. Through December 31, 2021, the Company completed $53 million of share repurchases at an average price of $40.22 per share,  including  $9  million  of  equivalent  shares  purchased  in  lieu  of  tax  withholdings  on  equity  compensation  issuances. Through February 24, 2022, an additional $82 million of share repurchases were executed at an average price of $40.26 per share, including $6 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuances. See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Renewable Power Purchase Agreements\n\nThe Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term generation through power purchase agreements. As of December 31,  2021,  NRG  has  entered  into  PPAs  totaling  approximately  2.6  GW  with  third-party  project  developers  and  other counterparties.  The  average  tenor  of  these  agreements  is  twelve  years.  The  Company  expects  to  continue  evaluating  and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW entered into through PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.\n\n## Dividend Increase\n\nIn  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  NRG  increased  the  annual  dividend  to  $1.30  from  $1.20  per  share.  In  2022,  NRG  further increased the annual dividend to $1.40 per share, representing an 8% increase from 2021. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWhile the pandemic presented risks, as further described in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Form 10-K, to the Company's  business,  there  was  not  a  material  adverse  impact  on  the  Company's  results  of  operations  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Economic Gross Margin\n\nIn  addition  to  gross  margin,  the  Company  evaluates  its  operating  performance  using  the  measure  of  economic  gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies' presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not  a  substitute  for  the  Company's  presentation  of  gross  margin,  which  is  the  most  directly  comparable  GAAP  measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to  investors  as  it  is  a  key  operational  measure  reviewed  by  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker.  Economic  gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuels, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities,  contract  amortization, emission credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other costs of operations.\n\nThe tables below present the composition and reconciliation of gross margin and economic gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n|                                                                                                           | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021   | Year Ended December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| ($ in millions, except otherwise noted)                                                                   | Texas                          | East                           | West/ Services/ Other          | Corporate/ Eliminations        | Total                          |\n| Retail revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  8,410                       | $  11,862                      | $  3,290                       | $  (1)                         | $  23,561                      |\n| Energy revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 329                            | 508                            | 371                            | 7                              | 1,215                          |\n| Capacity revenue   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | -

The $2.9 billion gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of increases in natural gas and power prices across all segments as well as the reversal of acquired contracts that settled during the year.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020 the $95 million gain in operating revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in New York capacity prices, as well as the  reversal  of  previously  recognized  unrealized  losses  on  contracts  that  settled  during  the  period.  The  $214  million  loss  in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as  a  result  of  decreases  in  ERCOT  power  prices  and  heat  rate  contraction,  as  well  as  the  reversal  of  previously  recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 815, the following table represents the results of the Company's financial and physical trading of energy  commodities  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021  and  2020.

market conditions and an assessment of various alternatives for the long-term operational landscape of the facility including the impact of the CEJA in Illinois, and $25 million related to various

These factors and others, including the Company's history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity Position\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  NRG's  liquidity,  excluding  collateral  funds  deposited  by  counterparties,  was approximately $2.7 billion and $7.0 billion, respectively, comprised of the following:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                     | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                       | 2021                 | 2020                 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents:   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | $  250               | $  3,905             |\n| Restricted cash - operating    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | 4                    | 3                    |\n| Restricted cash - reserves  (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 11                   | 3                    |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 265                  | 3,911                |\n| Total availability under Revolving Credit Facility and collective collateral facilities (b)  . . . . . . . .                                        | 2,421                | 3,129                |\n| Total liquidity, excluding collateral funds deposited by counterparties  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                      | $  2,686             | $  7,040             |",

        "page_content": "As  of  December  31,  2021,  total  liquidity,  excluding  collateral  funds  deposited  by  counterparties,  decreased  by  $4.4 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by the closing of the Direct Energy acquisition and the impact of Winter Storm Uri. Changes in cash and cash equivalent balances are further discussed under the heading Cash Flow Discussion .  Cash and cash equivalents  at  December  31,  2021  were  predominantly  held  in  money  market  funds  invested  in  treasury  securities,  treasury repurchase agreements or government agency debt.\n\nManagement believes that the Company's liquidity position and cash flows from operations will be adequate to finance operating and maintenance capital expenditures, to fund dividends to NRG's common stockholders, and to fund other liquidity commitments. Management continues to regularly monitor the Company's ability to finance the needs of its operating, financing and investing activity within the dictates of prudent balance sheet management.\n\n## Credit Ratings\n\nOn  March  17,  2021,  following  Winter  Storm  Uri,  Standard  &  Poor's  placed  NRG's  issuer  credit  rating  of  BB+  on CreditWatch with negative implications. On May 12, 2021, Standard & Poor's affirmed NRG's issuer credit rating of BB+ with a  stable  outlook.  On  March  19,  2021,  Moody's  changed  NRG's  rating  outlook  from  positive  to  stable.  At  the  same  time, Moody's affirmed NRG's corporate family rating of Ba1.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Company's current credit ratings:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                         | S&P        | Moody's    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| NRG Energy, Inc.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | BB+ Stable | Ba1 Stable |\n| 3.75% Senior Secured Notes, due 2024  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | BBB-       | Baa3       |\n| 2.00% Senior Secured Notes, due 2025  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | BBB-       | Baa3       |\n| 2.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2027  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | BBB-       | Baa3       |\n| 6.625% Senior Notes, due 2027  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| 5.75% Senior Notes, due 2028  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| 3.375% Senior Notes, due 2029  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| 4.45% Senior Secured Notes, due 2029  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .               | BBB-       | Baa3       |\n| 5.25% Senior Notes, due 2029  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| 3.625% Senior Notes, due 2031  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| 3.875% Senior Notes, due 2032  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | BB+        | Ba2        |\n| Revolving Credit Facility, due 2024   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .           | BBB-       | Baa3       |\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for NRG's operating and capital expenditures are expected to be derived from cash on hand,  cash  flows  from  operations  and  financing  arrangements.  As  described  in  Item  15  Note  13, Long-term  Debt  and Finance Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company's financing arrangements consist mainly of the Senior Notes, Convertible Senior Notes, Senior Secured First Lien Notes, Revolving Credit Facility, and tax-exempt bonds.\n\nThe Company's requirements for liquidity and capital resources, other than for operating its facilities, can generally be categorized  by  the  following:  (i)  market  operations  activities;  (ii)  debt  service  obligations,  as  described  more  fully  in Item 15 -  Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases , to the Consolidated Financial Statements; (iii) capital expenditures, including  maintenance,  repowering,  development,  and  environmental;  and  (iv)  allocations  in  connection  with  acquisition opportunities, debt repayments, share repurchases and dividend payments to stockholders, as described in Item 15 -  Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash,  subject  to  a  purchase  price  adjustment  of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The final purchase price adjustment resulted in additional payment of $22 million, which was paid to Centrica in December 2021.",

The  Company remains committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and continues to work to achieve investment grade credit metrics.\n\n## Issuance of 2032 Senior Notes\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the Company issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount at par of 3.875% senior notes due 2032 (the \"2032 Senior Notes\"). The 2032 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. The 2032 Senior Notes were issued under NRG's Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2032 Senior Notes from and including August 15, 2026.\n\n## Senior Note Redemptions\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company redeemed $1.9 billion in aggregate principal of its Senior Notes for  $1.9  billion  using  the  proceeds  of  the  2032  Senior  Notes  and  cash  on  hand.  In  connection  with  the  redemptions,  a $77 million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded.\n\n## Receivables Facility\n\nOn July  26,  2021,  NRG  Receivables  LLC,  a  wholly-owned  indirect  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  renewed  its  existing accounts receivable securitized borrowings facility (the \"Receivables Facility\") to, among others, (i) increase the facility size to $800 million, (ii) extend the maturity date until July 26, 2022, (iii) make certain adjustments to the pool of receivables through the Receivables Facility and certain related covenants, and (iv) provide for revised language relating to interest determination based on SOFR in case of a LIBOR cessation or the occurrence of certain other trigger events. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $400 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\n\n## Repurchase Facility\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company renewed its existing uncommitted repurchase facility (\"Repurchase Facility\") to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date to July 26, 2022 and (ii) provide for revised language relating to interest determination based  on  SOFR  in  case  of  a  LIBOR  cessation  or  the  occurrence  of  certain  other  trigger  events.  On  February  9,  2022,  the Company entered into amendments to its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the size of the facility from  $75  million  to  $150  million  and  (ii)  replace  LIBOR  with  term  SOFR  as  the  benchmark  for  the  pricing  rate.  The Repurchase Facility has no commitment fee and borrowings will be drawn at SOFR + 1.30%. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Repurchase Facility.\n\n## Sale of 4.8 GW of Fossil Generation Assets\n\nOn  December  1,  2021,  the  Company  closed  the  previously  announced  sale  of  approximately  4,850  MWs  of  fossil generating assets from its East and West regions to Generation Bridge, an affiliate of ArcLight Capital Partners. At Closing, NRG received $623 million of net proceeds, after working capital and other adjustments, including a deduction for cash flows generated of approximately $11 million per month from the beginning of the year until the closing of the transaction, in lieu of",

        "page_content": "## Market Operations\n\nThe Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g. buying fuel before receiving  energy  revenues);  and  (iv)  initial  collateral  for  large  structured  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  market operations had total cash collateral outstanding of $291 million and $3.5 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of December 31, 2021, total funds deposited by counterparties were $845 million in cash and $429 million of letters of credit.\n\nThe Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements to procure certain fuel and transportation services for the  Company's  generation  assets.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  had  minimum  payment  obligations  under  such outstanding agreements of $378 million, with $122 million payable within the next 12 months. Additionally, the Company has long-term  contractual  commitments  related  to  electricity  and  natural  gas  products,  including  power  purchases,  gas transportation and storage of various quantities and durations, and renewable purchased power agreements under PPAs with third-party  project  developers,  which  are  accounted  for  as  NPNS.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  had  minimum purchased energy commitments of $5.0 billion, with $1.6 billion payable within the next 12 months. For further discussion, see Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies .\n\nFuture liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements are dependent on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness.\n\n## First Lien Structure\n\nNRG has granted first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions  including  NRG's  assets  that  have  project-level  financing  and  the  assets  of  certain  non-guarantor  subsidiaries,  to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its  obligations  under  out-of-the-money  hedge  agreements  for  forward  sales  of  power  or  MWh  equivalents.  The  first  lien program does not limit the volume that can be hedged or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date.\n\nThe Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices exceed the hedged prices. As of December 31, 2021, all hedges under the first liens were out-of-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  amount  of  MW  hedged  against  the  Company's  coal  and  nuclear  assets  and  as  a percentage  relative  to  the  Company's  coal  and  nuclear  capacity  under  the  first  lien  structure  as  of  December  31,  2021:\n\n(a)\n\n| Equivalent Net Sales Secured by First Lien Structure                                                                                                                 | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| In MW  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 653    | 738    |\n| As a percentage of total net coal and nuclear capacity  (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                         | 15%    | 17%    |\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  Company's  capital  expenditures  for  maintenance,  environmental,  and  growth investments for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                        | Maintenance   | Environmental   | Growth  Investments (a)   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|\n| Texas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  (127)  $   | (1)             | $  (25)  $                | (153)   |\n| East   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (23)          | (1)             | (26)                      | (50)    |\n| West/Services/Other   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .            | (21)          | -               | -                         | (21)    |\n| Corporate   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | (4)           | -               | (41)                      | (45)    |\n| Total cash capital expenditures for 2021                                                                             | (175)         | (2)             | (92)                      | (269)   |\n| Investments   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | -             | -               | (47)                      | (47)    |\n| Total capital expenditures and investments  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                            | $  (175)  $   | (2)             | $  (139)  $               | (316)   |",

        "page_content": "Growth investments in East for the year ended December 31, 2021 include the Astoria generating facility, for which the Company has proposed to replace existing units with a single, new state-of-the-art Simple Cycle Combustion Turbine having a total generating capacity of 437 MW. On October 27, 2021, the NYSDEC Staff denied the Company's application for an air permit. On November 26, 2021, Astoria Gas Turbine Power LLC filed a Request for Adjudicatory Hearing on the NYSDEC's denial. To date, the Company has spent approximately $42 million on the Astoria project. Additionally, included in Investments are expenditures for Encina site improvements classified as ARO payments. Demolition of Encina is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022. The Company expects to begin marketing the site in 2022.\n\n## Environmental Capital Expenditures Estimate\n\nNRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2022 through 2026 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately $56 million. The largest component is the cost of complying with ELG at our coal units in Texas.\n\nThe table below summarizes the status of NRG's coal fleet with respect to air quality controls.

        "page_content": "## Share Repurchases\n\nIn December 2021, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase $1.0 billion of its common stock. Through December 31, 2021, the Company completed $53 million of share repurchases at an average price of $40.22 per share,  including  $9  million  of  equivalent  shares  purchased  in  lieu  of  tax  withholdings  on  equity  compensation  issuances. Through February 24, 2022, an additional $82 million of share repurchases were executed at an average price of $40.26 per share, including $6 million of equivalent shares purchased in lieu of tax withholdings on equity compensation issuances. See Item 15 - Note 16, Capital Structure , to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Dividend Increase\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, NRG increased the annual dividend to $1.30 from $1.20 per share. The Company returned $320 million of capital to shareholders in the year ended 2021 through a $1.30 dividend per common share. In 2022, NRG further  increased  the  annual  dividend  to  $1.40  per  share,  representing  an  8%  increase  from  2021.  The  Company  expects  to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in subsequent years.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per  share  on  an  annualized  basis,  payable  on  February  15,  2022,  to  stockholders  of  record  as  of  February  1,  2022.  The Company's common stock dividends are subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws and regulations.\n\n## Additional Material Cash Requirements Not Discussed Above\n\nOperating leases -  The Company leases generating facilities, land,  office  and  equipment,  railcars,  fleet  vehicles  and storefront space at retail stores. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had lease payment obligations of $372 million, of which $96 million is payable within the next 12 months. For further discussion, see Item 15 -  Note 10, Leases.\n\nOther  liabilities -Other  liabilities  includes  water  right  agreements,  service  and  maintenance  agreements,  stadium naming rights,  stadium  sponsorships,  LTSA  commitments  and  other  contractual  obligations.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the Company had total of $210 million under such commitments, of which $41 million are payable within the next 12 months.\n\nContingent  obligations  for  guarantees -  NRG   and  its  subsidiaries  enter  into  various  contracts  that  include indemnifications and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. For further discussion, see Item 15 - Note 27, Guarantees.\n\n## Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity\n\nVariable interest in Equity investments -  As of December 31, 2021, NRG has several investments with an ownership interest  percentage  of  50%  or  less  in  energy  and  energy-related  entities  that  are  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting. Ivanpah is considered a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary.\n\nNRG's  pro-rata  share  of  non-recourse  debt  held  by  unconsolidated  affiliates  was  approximately  $535  million  as  of December 31, 2021. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. See  also  Item  15  Note  17, Investments  Accounted  for  by  the  Equity  Method  and  Variable  Interest  Entities, to  the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\n\n## Cash Flow Discussion\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nThe following table reflects the changes in cash flows for the comparative years:\n\n|                                                                                                                             | Year ended December 31,   | Year ended December 31,   |            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                               | 2021                      | 2020                      | Change     |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  493                    | $  1,837                  | $  (1,344) |\n| Net cash used by investing activities   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (3,039)                   | (494)                     | (2,545)    |\n| Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities                                                                            | (272)                     | 2,204                     | (2,476)    |",

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of $2.8 billion and foreign pretax  book  income  of  $100  million.  For  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  utilized  U.S.  federal  NOLs  of $1.6 billion due to current year taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has cumulative U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $8.4 billion, of which $11 million were generated prior to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will begin expiring in 2031  and  cumulative  state  NOL  carryforwards  of  $5.2  billion  for  financial  statement  purposes.  NRG  also  has  cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $383 million, which do not have an expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a $20 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as $384 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates income tax payments, due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, of up to $58 million in 2022.",

With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2013.\n\n## Guarantor Financial Information\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of $375 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and $821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes, as shown in Note 13, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases .  These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100% owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the 'Guarantors'). See Exhibit 22.1 for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several.\n\nNRG  conducts  much  of  its  business  through  and  derives  much  of  its  income  from  its  subsidiaries.  Therefore,  the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the 'Non-Guarantors'). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries.\n\nThe tables below present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X.

Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Commodity Price Risk , NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict  risk  of  loss  based  on  market  price  and  volatility.  NRG's  risk  management  policy  places  a  limit  on  one-day  holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative assets and liability position is a better indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of December 31, 2021, NRG's net derivative asset was $2.3 billion, an increase to total fair value of $2.4 billion as compared to December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by roll-off trades that settled during the period, as well as gains in fair value.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu increase in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in an increase of approximately $1.3 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe impact of a $0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a decrease of approximately $1.4 billion in the net value of derivatives as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe  Company's  discussion  and  analysis  of  the  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory  challenges,  and  the  fair  value  of  certain  assets  and  liabilities.  These  judgments,  in  and  of  themselves,  could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the accounting guidance has not changed.",

815, Derivatives  and  Hedging, or  ASC  815,  to  account  for  derivative instruments. ASC 815 requires the Company to mark-to-market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet and recognize fair  value  change  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  ASC  815  applies  to  NRG's  energy  related commodity contracts, interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\nFor purposes of measuring the fair value of derivative instruments, the Company uses quoted exchange prices and broker quotes. When external prices are not available, NRG uses internal models to determine the fair value. These internal models include assumptions of the future prices of energy commodities based on the specific market in which the energy commodity is being purchased or sold, using externally available forward market pricing curves for all periods possible under the pricing model. These estimations are considered to be critical accounting estimates.",

        "page_content": "During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  entered  into  $1.6  billion  of  interest  rate  hedges  associated  with anticipated  certain  financing  needs.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  interest  rate  hedges  were  settled  in  connection  with  the issuance of fixed rate debt, resulting in a gain of $11 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense. In order to qualify the derivative instruments for hedged transactions prior to termination, NRG estimated the forecasted borrowings for interest rate swaps occurring within a specified time period.\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nCertain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting, as they are considered to be NPNS. The availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that the Company has the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item. These assumptions are based on expected load requirements, internal forecasts of sales and generation and historical physical delivery on contracts. Derivatives  that  are  considered  to  be  NPNS  are  exempt  from  derivative  accounting  treatment  and  are  accounted  for  under accrual  accounting.  If  it  is  determined  that  a  transaction  designated  as  NPNS  no  longer  meets  the  scope  exception  due  to changes in estimates, the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with the immediate recognition through earnings.\n\n## Income Taxes and Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  NRG's  deferred  tax  assets  were  primarily  the  result  of  U.S.  federal  and  state  NOLs,  the difference  between  book  and  tax  basis  in  property,  plant,  and  equipment,  and  tax  credit  carryforwards.  The  realization  of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the Company's ability to generate sufficient future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible, prior to the expiration of the tax attributes. The evaluation of deferred tax  assets  requires  judgment  in  assessing  the  likely  future  tax  consequences  of  events  that  have  been  recognized  in  the Company's financial statements or tax returns and forecasting future profitability by tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets quarterly on a jurisdictional basis to determine whether adjustments to the valuation  allowance  are  appropriate  considering  changes  in  facts  or  circumstances.  As  of  each  reporting  date,  management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, when determining the future realization of the Company's deferred tax assets. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  maintain  a  valuation  allowance  of  approximately  $248  million  as  of  December  31,  2021 against deferred tax assets consisting of state net operating losses and foreign NOL carryforwards in jurisdictions where the Company does not currently believe that the realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. As of December 31, 2020 the Company's valuation allowance balance was $266 million.\n\nConsiderable  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  tax  treatment  of  a  particular  item  that  involves  interpretations  of complex tax laws. The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal jurisdiction  and  various  state  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  operations  located  in  Australia  and  Canada.  The  Company continues to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2018. With few exceptions, state and and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years before 2013.\n\nNRG does not intend, nor currently foresee a need, to repatriate funds held at our international operations into the U.S. These funds are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations and the Company has not changed its assertion with respect to distributions of funds that would require the accrual of U.S. income tax.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value\n\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment , or ASC 360, the Company evaluates property, plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Examples of such indicators or events include:\n\n- \u00b7 Significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset;\n- \u00b7 Significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition;\n- \u00b7 Adverse business climate;\n- \u00b7 Accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amounts originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset;\n- \u00b7 Current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses; and\n- \u00b7 Change in the Company's intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than 50% likelihood that an asset will be sold, or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, through considering project specific assumptions for long-term power and natural gas prices, escalated future project operating costs and expected plant operations. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the different courses of action available to the Company. Generally, fair value will be determined using valuation techniques, such as the present value of expected future cash flows. NRG uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors, including forward price curves for energy, fuel and operating costs. However, actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in the Company's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nFor assets to be held and used, if the Company determines that the undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset, NRG must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss. Assets heldfor-sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell. The estimation of fair value, whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held-for-sale, and the evaluation of asset impairment are, by their nature, subjective. The Company considers quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available. In the absence  of  such  information,  NRG  may  consider  prices  of  similar  assets,  consult  with  brokers,  or  employ  other  valuation techniques. The Company will also discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative  of  the  risk  involved  with  such  an  investment  or  asset.  The  use  of  these  methods  involves  the  same  inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows. Actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in NRG's estimates and the impact of such variations could be material.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year were released leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM coal generating assets in June 2022. The Company considered the decline in PJM capacity prices and the near-term retirement dates of certain assets to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. The Company measured the impairment losses on the PJM generation assets and Midwest Generation goodwill  as  the  difference  between  the  carrying  amount  and  the  fair  value  of  the  PJM  generating  assets  and  Midwest Generation  reporting  unit,  respectively.  Fair  values  were  determined  primarily  using  an  income  approach  in  which  the Company applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budgets for the plants and reporting unit. Significant inputs impacting the income approach include the Company's long-term view of capacity and fuel prices, projected generation, the physical and economic characteristics of each plant, and the discount rate applied to the after-tax cash flow projections. Impairment  losses  of  $271  million  and  $35  million  were  recorded  in  the  East  segment  on  the  PJM  generating  assets  and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\nAnnually, during the fourth quarter, the Company revises its views of power and fuel prices including the Company's fundamental view for long-term prices, forecasted generation and operating and capital expenditures, in connection with the preparation of its annual budget. Changes to the Company's views of long-term power and fuel prices impact the Company's projections of profitability, based on management's estimate of supply and demand within the sub-markets for its operations and the physical and economic characteristics of each of its businesses.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $213 million in the East segment as a result of  changes  in  the  long-term  outlook  of  the  Joliet  facility  prompted  by  market  conditions  and  an  assessment  of  various alternatives for the long-term operational landscape of the facility including the impact of the CEJA in Illinois, which concluded with the annual budget process. The Company recorded additional impairment losses of $16 million and $9 million related to various power plants in the East and West/Services/Other segments, respectively.",

        "page_content": "In the third quarter of 2020, the Company concluded its Home Solar business was held for sale as a result of advanced negotiations to sell the business and recorded an impairment loss of $29 million in the West/Services/Other segment to adjust the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities to fair market value based on indicative sale prices. On November 13, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the Home Solar business for $66 million.\n\nIn  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  recognized  an  impairment  loss  of  $32  million  in  the  West/Services/Other segment related to the Cottonwood facility. The impairment was attributable to the Company's long-term services agreement and related lease payments, as the carrying amounts of the assets from the contract were higher than the estimated operating cash flow though the remaining lease period. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded $14 million of impairment losses related to intangible assets in the Texas segment.\n\n## Equity Method Investments\n\nThe Company is also required to evaluate for impairment its equity method investments in accordance with ASC 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures ,  or  ASC 323. The standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under ASC 323 is whether an observed decline in the value of an equity method investment is considered other-thantemporary. The evaluation and measurement of impairments under ASC 323 involves the same uncertainties as described for long-lived assets that the Company owns directly and accounts for in accordance with ASC 360. Similarly, the estimates that the Company makes with respect to its equity method investments are subjective, and the impact of variations in these estimates could be material. Additionally, if the projects in which the Company holds these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of ASC 360, the Company would record its proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate its investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value under ASC 323. During the first quarter of 2020, NRG recorded an impairment  loss  of  $18  million  in  the  Texas  segment,  attributable  to  its  equity  method  investment  in  Petra  Nova  Parish Holdings,  which  included  the  anticipated  drawdown  of  the  $12  million  letter  of  credit  posted  in  September  2019  to  cover certain project debt reserve requirements.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company reported goodwill of $1.8 billion, consisting of $1.3 billion from the acquisition of Direct  Energy  in  2021,  $130  million  associated  with  the  acquisition  of  Midwest  Generation  and  $414  million  for  retail operations acquisitions, including Stream Energy, which was acquired in 2019.\n\nThe Company applies ASC 805, Business Combinations , or ASC 805, and ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, or ASC 350  to  account  for  its  goodwill  and  intangible  assets.  Under  these  standards,  the  Company  amortizes  all  finite-lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted-average useful lives, while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized.  Goodwill  is  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually,  or  more  frequently  whenever  an  event  or  change  in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is identified by assessing whether the components of the  Company's  operating  segments  constitute  businesses  for  which  discrete  financial  information  is  available  and  whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company performs the annual goodwill impairment  assessment  as  of  December  31  or  when  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  fair  value  of  the reporting unit may be below the carrying amount. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. In the absence of sufficient qualitative factors, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing to its book value. If it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount, the Company's goodwill will be impaired at that time.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year were released leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM coal generating assets in June 2022. The Company considered the decline in PJM capacity prices and the near-term retirement dates of certain assets to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. An impairment of $35 million was recorded in Midwest Generation goodwill. For further discussion, see Evaluation of Assets for Impairment and Other-Than-Temporary Decline in Value caption above.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed its qualitative assessment of macroeconomic, industry and market events and circumstances, and the overall financial performance of the Texas (Texas segment) and East Retail (East segment) reporting units. The Company determined it was more-likely-than not that the fair value of the goodwill attributed to these  reporting  units  were  more  than  their  carrying  amount  and  accordingly,  no  impairment  existed  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company also performed a quantitative assessment for the Midwest Generation (East segment) and West/Services/Other reporting units. The Company determined the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach. Based on the income approach, the Company estimated the fair value of each reporting units' cash flows exceeded  its  carrying  value  and,  as  such,  NRG  concluded  that  the  goodwill  associated  with  each  reporting  unit  was  not impaired as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company believes the methodology and assumptions used in its quantitative assessments were consistent with the views of market participants. Significant inputs to the determinations of fair value of the Midwest Generation reporting unit were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The  Company  applied  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  to  the  long-term  budgets  for  the  Midwest  Generation plants, resulting in fair value over the carrying value of the reporting unit of 117%. The significant assumptions used to derive the long-term budgets used in the income approach are affected by the following key inputs:\n- \u00b7 The Company's views of power, capacity and fuel prices consider market prices for the next five years and the Company's fundamental view for the longer term, driven by the Company's long-term view of the price of natural gas. The Company's fundamental view for the longer term reflects the implied prices and heat rate that would support new build of a combined cycle gas plant. The price of natural gas plays an important role in setting the price of electricity in many of the regions where NRG operates power plants. Hedging is included to the extent of contracts already in place;\n- \u00b7 The  Company's  estimate  of  generation,  fuel  costs,  capital  expenditure  requirements  and  the  existing  and anticipated impact of environmental regulations;\n- \u00b7 The Company's fundamental view for the longer term, cash flows for the plants in the region were included in the fair value calculation through the end of each plants' estimated useful life; and\n- \u00b7 Projected  generation  and  resulting  energy  gross  margin  in  the  long-term  budgets  is  based  on  an  hourly dispatch  that  simulates  dispatch  of  each  unit  into  the  power  market.  The  dispatch  simulation  is  based  on power prices, fuel prices, and the physical and economic characteristics of each plant.\n\nFair  value  determinations  require  considerable  judgment  and  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  underlying  assumptions  and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe account for business acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed under ASC 805. Under this method, we are required to record on our Consolidated Balance Sheets the estimated fair values of the acquired company's assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  is  recorded  as  goodwill.  Determining  fair  values  of  assets  acquired  and liabilities  assumed  requires  significant  estimates  and  judgments.  We  determine  fair  value  based  on  the  estimated  price  that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities that involved the most subjectivity in determining fair value consisted of the trade names, customer relationships and derivative contracts.\n\nThe fair  value  of  trade  names  and  customer  relationships  was  measured  using  income-based  valuation  methodologies, which include  certain  assumptions  such  as  forecasted  future  cash  flows,  customer  attrition  rates,  royalty  rates  and  discount rates. The trade names are amortized to depreciation and amortization, on a straight line basis. The customer relationships are amortized to depreciation and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows.\n\nIn measuring the fair value of derivative contracts, a significant portion of the fair value of the derivative portfolio was based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts were valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. The fair value of each contract was discounted using a risk free interest rate. In addition, the Company applied a credit reserve to reflect credit risk.

Gain  contingencies  are  not  recorded  until management determines it is certain that the future event will become or does become a reality. Such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances, forecasts of future events, and estimates of the financial impacts of such events. NRG describes in detail its contingencies in Item 15 -  Note 23, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments\n\nSee  Item  15  Note  2, Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Policies, to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  a discussion of recent accounting developments.\n\n## Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may  result  from  market  changes  associated  with  the  Company's  retail  operations,  merchant  power  generation,  or  with  an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency exchange risk. In order to manage these risks, the Company uses  various  fixed-price  forward  purchase  and  sales  contracts,  futures  and  option  contracts  traded  on  NYMEX  and  other exchanges, and swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter financial markets to:\n\n- \u00b7 Manage and hedge fixed-price purchase and sales commitments;\n- \u00b7 Reduce exposure to the volatility of cash market prices, and\n- \u00b7 Hedge fuel requirements for the Company's generating facilities.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nCommodity  price  risks  result  from  exposures  to  changes  in  spot  prices,  forward  prices,  volatilities,  and  correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil, and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's load servicing obligations and merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of electricity and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of its energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, gas transportation and storage assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions, based on historical and forward values for factors such as customer demand, weather, commodity availability and commodity prices. The Company's VaR model is based on a one-day holding period at a 95% confidence interval for the forward 36 months, not including the spot month. The VaR model is not a complete picture of all risks that may affect the Company's results. Certain events such as counterparty defaults, regulatory changes, and extreme weather and prices that deviate significantly from historically observed values are not reflected in the model.\n\nThe following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, calculated using the VaR model for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| VaR as of December 31,  (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | $  30  | $  30  |\n| For the year ended December 31,                                                                                                                                 |        |        |\n| Average (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | $  35  | $  30  |\n| Maximum (b)     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 53     | 47     |\n| Minimum (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 23     | 22     |\n\nIn  order  to  provide  additional  information,  the  Company  also  uses  VaR  to  estimate  the  potential  loss  of  derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading was $242 million  as  of  December  31,  2021,  primarily  driven  by  asset-backed  transactions.  The  increase  in  the  VaR  for  derivative financial instruments was primarily due to the acquisition of Direct Energy.",

        "page_content": "## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nNRG is exposed to retail credit risk related to its Business and Home customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the  loss  of  in-the-money  forward  value.  NRG  manages  retail  credit  risk  through  the  use  of  established  credit  policies  that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures, such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company's provision for credit losses resulting from credit risk was $698 million, $108 million and $95 million for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020 and  2019,  respectively.  As  a  result  of  Winter  Storm  Uri,  the  Company  incurred  additional  credit  losses  from  Business customers primarily due to a segment of customers whose contracts included a pass through of wholesale power prices which were  significantly  escalated  during  the  storm  and  from  customers  who  failed  to  meet  their  obligations  in  ERCOT  load curtailment programs.\n\n## Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations.\n\nBased on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of December 31, 2021, a $0.50 per  MMBtu  decrease  in  natural  gas  prices  across  the  term  of  the  marginable  contracts  would  cause  an  increase  in  margin collateral posted of approximately $828 million and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately $378 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established  credit  approval  process;  (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation measures  such  as  margin,  collateral,  prepayment  arrangements,  or  volumetric  limits;  (iv)  the  use  of  payment  netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures of various contracts associated with a single counterparty. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the  amount  and  timing  of  expected  cash  flows.  The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  counterparty  risk  by  having  a  diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $2.2 billion, of which the Company held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $598 million resulting in a net exposure of $1.6 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 87% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off  by  the  end  of  2023.  The  following  table  highlights  the  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by counterparty  credit  quality.  Net  counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market, NPNS, and non-derivative  transactions.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  the  aggregate  credit  exposure  is  shown  net  of  collateral  held,  and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                  | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                                          | 67 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 33                                   |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |",

Changes  in  hedge  positions  and  market  prices  will  affect  credit  exposure  and  counterparty concentration.\n\nDuring Winter Storm Uri, the Company experienced nonperformance by a counterparty in one of its bilateral financial hedging transactions, resulting in exposure of $403 million. The Company is pursuing all means available to enforce its rights under  this  transaction  but,  given  the  size  of  the  exposure,  cannot  determine  with  certainty  what  the  amount  of  its  ultimate recovery will be. The full exposure was recorded as a provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and include credit  policies  that,  under  certain  circumstances,  require  that  losses  arising  from  the  default  of  one  member  on  spot  market transactions  be  shared  by  the  remaining  participants.  As  a  result,  the  counterparty  credit  risk  to  these  markets  is  limited  to NRG's applicable share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market  and  extrapolation  of  observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Based  on  these  valuation  techniques,  as  of December 31, 2021, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $1.1 billion for the next five years.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company's debt fair value was $8.3 billion and carrying value was $8.0 billion. NRG estimates that a 1% decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt by $690 million.\n\n## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging and trading agreements contain provisions that entitle the counterparty to demand that the Company post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in the Company's credit quality, generally termed 'adequate assurance' under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there  were  a  downgrade  in  the  Company's  credit  rating.  In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy  from Centrica,  certain  of  the  Company's  agreements  as  of  December  31,  2021,  were  still  supported  by  credit  support  posted  by Centrica,  and  as  a  result  could  require  the  Company  to  post  collateral  upon  a  deterioration  or  downgrade  of  Centrica.  The collateral  potentially  required  for  contracts  with  adequate  assurance  clauses  that  are  in  a  net  liability  position  as  of December 31, 2021, was $1.0 billion. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability  position,  but  the  counterparty  has  not  called  for  the  collateral  due,  which  was  approximately  $70  million  as  of December 31, 2021. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, $1 million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Currency Exchange Risk\n\nNRG is subject to transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the United States, primarily within Canada, as well as from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises  from  the  purchase  and  sale  of  goods  and  services  in  currencies  other  than  our  functional  currency  or  the  functional currency  of  an  applicable  subsidiary.  NRG  hedges  a  portion  of  its  forecasted  currency  transactions  with  foreign  exchange forward contracts. As of December 31, 2021, NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business and entered into foreign exchange contracts with notional amount of $279 million.\n\nThe Company is subject to translation exchange rate risk related to the translation of the financial statements of its foreign operations  into  U.S.  dollars.  Costs  incurred  and  sales  recorded  by  subsidiaries  operating  outside  of  the  United  States  are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10% appreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2021 would have resulted in an increase of $10 million to net income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\n## Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n\nThe financial statements and schedules are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Item 9 - Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\n\nNone.\n\n## Item 9A - Controls and Procedures\n\n## Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on  this  evaluation,  the  Company's  principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and  principal  accounting  officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm are incorporated under the caption \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\" and under the caption \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of Direct Energy. In the first quarter of 2022, the Company integrated a significant component of Direct Energy's accounting systems into NRG's legacy ERP system. As part of this integration, the Company has completed the evaluation of our internal controls related to Direct Energy, and designed and implemented a control structure over Direct Energy's operations. Other than the Direct Energy acquisition, there were  no  changes  in  NRG's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  (as  such  term  is  defined  in  Rule  13a-15(f)  under  the Exchange Act) that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG's internal control over financial reporting.",

        "page_content": "## Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls\n\nNRG's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n- 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company's receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors; and\n- 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInternal  control  over  financial  reporting  cannot  provide  absolute  assurance  of  achieving  financial  reporting  objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control  over  financial reporting,  as  such  term  is  defined  in  Exchange  Act  Rule  13a-15(f).  Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  the Company's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, the  Company  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Company's evaluation under the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , the  Company's  management  concluded  that  its  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of December 31, 2021.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, NRG acquired Direct Energy, as further described in Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions. Direct Energy comprised of approximately 35% of the Company's total assets as of December 31, 2021 and approximately 58% of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we are in  the  process of evaluating the internal controls of the acquired business and integrated it into our existing operations. The acquired business has, therefore, been excluded from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB),  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  the  Company  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  the  related  consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period  ended  December  31,  2021,  and  the  related  notes  and  financial  statement  schedule  II  (collectively,  the  consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company acquired Direct Energy during 2021 and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Direct Energy's internal control over financial reporting are associated with 35% of total assets and 58% of total revenues included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of  the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Direct Energy.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe  Company's  management  is  responsible  for  maintaining  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  and  for  its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA  company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  is  a  process  designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  (1)  pertain  to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also, projections  of  any  evaluation  of  effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## /s/ KPMG LLP\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 24, 2022",

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing  separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over operating revenues\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company  had  $26.989  billion  of  operating revenues.  Operating  revenue  is  derived  from  various  revenue  streams  in  different  geographic  markets  and  the Company's processes and related information technology (IT) systems used to record revenue differ for each of these revenue streams.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of  audit  evidence  over  operating  revenues  as  a  critical  audit  matter which required a high degree of auditor judgment due to the number of revenue streams and IT systems involved in the revenue  recognition  process.  This  included  determining  the  revenue  streams  over  which  procedures  were  to  be performed and evaluating the nature and extent of evidence obtained over the individual revenue streams as well as operating revenue in the aggregate. It also included the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the performance of certain procedures.",

        "page_content": "The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We, with the assistance of IT professionals, applied auditor judgment to determine the revenue streams over which procedures were performed as well as the nature and extent of such procedures. For certain revenue streams, we evaluated the design and tested the operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  over  the  Company's  revenue  recognition  processes.  For  certain revenue streams, we involved IT professionals, who assisted in testing certain IT applications used by the Company in its  revenue  recognition  processes.  In  addition,  we  assessed  recorded  revenue  for  a  selection  of  transactions  by comparing the amounts recognized to underlying documentation, including contracts with customers. In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over operating revenues by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the appropriateness of such evidence.\n\n## Fair value of customer relationship intangible assets\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Direct Energy on January 5, 2021  for  consideration  of  $3.724  billion.  The  Company  recorded  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed at fair value at the acquisition date, including $1.277 billion of customer relationship intangible assets which represent the generation of future income reflective of Direct Energy's customer base. Customer relationship intangible assets were valued using the excess earnings method of the income approach.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in the Direct Energy transaction  as  a  critical  audit  matter.  A  higher  degree  of  auditor  judgment  was  required  to  evaluate  the  customer attrition used in the excess earnings method. Changes in the customer attrition could have a significant impact on the forecasted  future  cash  flows  used  in  the  excess  earnings  method  and  the  resulting  fair  value  of  the  customer relationship intangible assets.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company's acquisition-date valuation process, including controls over the development of the customer attrition. We performed sensitivity analyses over the Company's customer attrition used to determine the estimated fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets to  assess  the  effect  of  changes  in  that  assumption  on  the  Company's  determination  of  fair  value.  We  evaluated  the customer attrition by comparing it to the Company's actual customer attrition.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2004.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania February 24, 2022",

        "page_content": "## Note 1 Nature of Business\n\n## General\n\nNRG Energy, Inc., or NRG or the Company, is a consumer services company built on dynamic retail brands. NRG brings the power of energy to customers by producing and selling energy and related products and services, nation-wide in the U.S. and  Canada  in  a  manner  that  delivers  value  to  all  of  NRG's  stakeholders.  NRG  sells  power,  natural  gas,  home  and  power services, and develops innovative, sustainable solutions, predominately under the brand names NRG, Reliant, Direct Energy, Green Mountain Energy, Stream, and XOOM Energy. The Company has a customer base that includes approximately 6 million Home  customers  as  well  as  commercial,  industrial,  and  wholesale  customers,  supported  by  approximately  18,000  MW  of generation.\n\nOn January 5, 2021, the Company acquired Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in  North  America,  with  operations  in  all  50  U.S.  states  and  8  Canadian  provinces.  The  acquisition  increases  NRG's  retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and complements its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it does not currently operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business. See  Note  4, Acquisitions,  Discontinued  Operations  and  Dispositions ,  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  further discussion of the acquisition of Direct Energy.\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company sold approximately 4,850 MWs of fossil generating assets from its East and West regions  to  Generation  Bridge,  an  affiliate  of  ArcLight  Capital  Partners.  NRG  received  $623  million  of  net  proceeds,  after purchase price adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement entered into on February 28, 2021. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into a tolling agreement for the 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April 2025.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the results of the PJM Base Residual Auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year were released, leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of approximately 1,600 MW of its PJM coal generating assets in June 2022. On July 30, 2021, PJM identified reliability impacts resulting from the proposed deactivation of one of those assets, Indian River Unit 4. On August 27, 2021 the Company notified PJM that it would continue operations at Indian River Unit 4 until the reliability upgrades identified by PJM were completed, provided that the unit receives a satisfactory and compensatory  reliability  must  run  arrangement.  See  Item  15 -Note  11, Asset  Impairments, to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements for further discussion. The Company is continuing to evaluate the viability of the remaining PJM generating assets.\n\nThe Company manages its operations based on the combined results of the retail and wholesale generation businesses with a geographical focus.\n\nThe Company's business is segmented as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Texas, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in Texas;\n- \u00b7 East, which includes all activity related to customer, plant and market operations in the East;\n- \u00b7 West/Services/Other,  which  includes  the  following  assets  and  activities:  (i)  all  activity  related  to  plant  and  market operations in the West and Canada, (ii) the Services businesses (iii) activity related to the Cottonwood facility, (iv) the remaining renewables activity, including the Company's equity method investment in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, and (v) activity related to the Company's equity method investment for the Gladstone power plant in Australia; and\n- \u00b7 Corporate activities.\n\n## Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.  The  ASC, established by the FASB, is the source of authoritative U.S. GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities. In addition, the rules  and  interpretative  releases  of  the  SEC  under  authority  of  federal  securities  laws  are  also  sources  of  authoritative  U.S. GAAP for SEC registrants.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include NRG's accounts and operations and those of its subsidiaries in which the Company  has  a  controlling  interest.  All  significant  intercompany  transactions  and  balances  have  been  eliminated  in consolidation. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity.  However,  a  controlling  financial  interest  may  also  exist  through  arrangements  that  do  not  involve  controlling  voting\n\n## NRG ENERGY, INC.

        "page_content": "interests. As such, NRG applies the guidance of ASC 810, Consolidations, or  ASC 810, to determine when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or not controlled through its voting interests, referred to as a VIE, should be consolidated.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.\n\n## Funds Deposited by Counterparties\n\nFunds deposited by counterparties consist of cash held by the Company as a result of collateral posting obligations from its counterparties. Though some amounts are segregated into separate accounts, not all funds are contractually restricted. Based on the Company's intention, these funds are not available for the payment of general corporate obligations; however, they are available  for  liquidity  management.  Depending  on  market  fluctuations  and  the  settlement  of  the  underlying  contracts,  the Company will refund this collateral to the hedge counterparties pursuant to the terms and conditions of the underlying trades. Since collateral requirements fluctuate daily and the Company cannot predict if any collateral will be held for more than twelve months,  the  funds  deposited  by  counterparties  are  classified  as  a  current  asset  on  the  Company's  balance  sheet,  with  an offsetting liability for this cash collateral received within current liabilities.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Uplift Securitization Proceeds\n\nThe Texas Legislature passed HB 4492 for ERCOT to mitigate exceptionally high price adders and ancillary service costs incurred by LSEs during Winter Storm Uri. HB 4492 authorized ERCOT to obtain $2.1 billion of financing to distribute to LSEs that were charged and paid to ERCOT those highly priced ancillary service and ORDPA during Winter Storm Uri.\n\nIn December 2021, ERCOT filed with the PUCT a calculation of each LSE's share of proceeds based on the settlement methodology. The Company accounted for the proceeds we will receive by analogy to the contribution model within ASC 958-605, Not-for-Profit Entities- Revenue Recognition and the grant model within IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance , as a reduction to expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the annual period for which the proceeds are intended to compensate. The Company expects to receive proceeds of $689 million from ERCOT in the second quarter of 2022 and we concluded that the threshold for recognizing a receivable was met in December 2021 as the amounts to be received are determinable and ERCOT was directed by its governing body, the PUCT, to take all actions required to effectuate the $2.1 billion funding approved in the DOO. The associated expense reduction is reflected in Cost  of  operations  within  our  consolidated  statements  of  operations  as  that  is  where  the  initial  costs  which  are  being compensated for were recorded.\n\n## Credit Losses\n\nOn  January  1,  2020,  the  Company  adopted  ASU  No.  2016-13, Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (Topic  326): Measurement of  Credit  Losses  on  Financial  Instruments ,  or  ASU  No.  2016-13,  using  the  modified  retrospective  approach. Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company's process of estimating expected credit losses remains materially consistent with its historical practice. Information prior to January 1, 2020, which was previously referred to as the allowance and provision for bad debt, has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period.\n\nRetail trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet net of the allowance for credit losses. The Company accrues an allowance for current expected credit losses based on (i) estimates of uncollectible revenues by analyzing accounts receivable aging and current and reasonable forecasts of expected economic factors including, but not limited to, unemployment rates and weather-related  events,  (ii)  historical  collections  and  delinquencies,  and  (iii)  counterparty  credit  ratings  for  commercial  and industrial  customers.  The  Company  writes  off  customer  contract  receivable  balances  against  the  allowance  for  credit  losses when it is determined a receivable is uncollectible.\n\nThe  following  table  represents  the  activity  in  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021:\n\n|                                                                                                                                    | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                      | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Beginning balance   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  67                     | $  43                     |\n| Acquired balance from Direct Energy                                                                                                | 112                       | -                         |\n| Provision for credit losses (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | 698                       | 108                       |\n| Write-offs   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (224)                     | (101)                     |\n| Recoveries collected   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | 30                        | 17                        |\n| Ending balance (a)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | $  683                    | $  67                     |",

        "page_content": "The increase in the provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020 was primarily due  to  the  impacts  of  Winter  Storm  Uri  on  bilateral  finance  hedging  risk  of  $403  million,  counterparty  credit  risk  of $126 million and ERCOT default shortfall payments of $67 million.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nThe  following  table  provides  a  reconciliation  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  funds  deposited  by counterparties reported within the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of cash flows.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                       | $  250                    | $  3,905                  | $  345                    |\n| Funds deposited by counterparties   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                            | 845                       | 19                        | 32                        |\n| Restricted cash  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                               | 15                        | 6                         | 8                         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties and restricted cash shown  in the statements of cash flows  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  1,110                  | $  3,930                  | $  385                    |\n\nRestricted  cash  consists  primarily  of  funds  held  to  satisfy  the  requirements  of  certain  debt  agreements  and  funds  held within the Company's projects that are restricted in their use.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventory is valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, and consists principally of natural gas, fuel oil, coal, spare parts and finished goods. The Company removes natural gas inventory in the delivery of goods to customers and as they are used in the production of electricity or steam. The Company removes fuel oil and coal inventories as they are used in the production of electricity. Spare parts inventory is valued at weighted average cost. The Company removes these inventories when they are used for repairs, maintenance or capital projects. The Company expects to recover the natural gas, fuel oil, coal and spare parts costs in the ordinary course of business. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a first in first out basis for finished goods and weighted average cost method for all other inventories. The Company removes these inventories as they are sold to customers. Sales of inventory are classified as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of business acquisitions, fair value; however, impairment adjustments  are  recorded  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  their  carrying  values  may  not  be recoverable. NRG also classifies nuclear fuel related to the Company's 44% ownership interest in STP as part of the Company's property, plant, and equipment. Significant additions or improvements extending asset lives are capitalized as incurred, while repairs  and  maintenance  that  do  not  improve  or  extend  the  life  of  the  respective  asset  are  charged  to  expense  as  incurred. Depreciation, other than nuclear fuel, is computed using the straight-line method, while nuclear fuel is amortized based on units of production over the estimated useful lives. Certain assets and their related accumulated depreciation amounts are adjusted for asset retirements and disposals with the resulting gain or loss included in cost of operations in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Asset Impairments\n\nLong-lived  assets  that  are  held  and  used  are  reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. Such reviews are performed in accordance with ASC 360. An impairment loss is  indicated if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value. An impairment charge is measured by the difference between an asset's carrying amount and fair value with the difference recorded in  operating  costs  and  expenses  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  Fair  values  are  determined  by  a  variety  of valuation methods, including third-party appraisals, sales prices of similar assets, and present value techniques.\n\nInvestments accounted for by the equity method are reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 323, InvestmentsEquity Method and Joint Ventures ,  or  ASC  323,  which  requires  that  a  loss  in  value  of  an  investment  that  is  an  other-thantemporary  decline  should  be  recognized.  The  Company  identifies  and  measures  losses  in  the  value  of  equity  method investments based upon a comparison of fair value to carrying value. For further discussion of these matters, refer to Note 11, Asset Impairments .",

        "page_content": "## Development Costs and Capitalized Interest\n\nDevelopment  costs  include  project  development  costs,  which  are  expensed  in  the  preliminary  stages  of  a  project  and capitalized when the project is deemed to be commercially viable. Commercial viability is determined by one or a series of actions including, among others, Board of Director approval pursuant to a formal project plan that subjects the Company to significant  future  obligations  that  can  only  be  discharged  by  the  use  of  a  Company  asset.  When  a  project  is  available  for operations, capitalized interest and capitalized project development costs are reclassified to property, plant and equipment and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the project's related assets. Capitalized costs are charged to expense if a project is abandoned or management otherwise determines the costs to be unrecoverable.\n\nInterest incurred on funds borrowed to finance capital projects is capitalized until the project under construction is ready for its intended use. The amount of interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $2 million, $2 million and $3 million, respectively.\n\n## Debt Issuance Costs\n\nDebt issuance costs are capitalized and amortized as interest expense on a basis which approximates the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt, or as an asset if the issuance costs relate to revolving debt agreements or certain other financing arrangements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIntangible  assets  represent  contractual  rights  held  by  the  Company.  The  Company  recognizes  specifically  identifiable intangible assets including emission allowances, customer and supply contracts, customer relationships, marketing partnerships, trade names and fuel contracts when specific rights and contracts are acquired. These intangible assets are amortized based on expected volumes, expected delivery, expected discounted future net cash flows, straight line or units of production basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had accumulated amortization related to its intangible assets of $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.\n\nEmission allowances held-for-sale, which are included in other non-current assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet, are not amortized; they are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other ,  or  ASC 350, the Company recognizes goodwill for the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. NRG performs goodwill impairment tests annually, during the fourth quarter, and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nThe Company first assesses qualitative factors to  determine  whether  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  fair  value  of  a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, there is no goodwill impairment.\n\nIn the absence of sufficient qualitative factors indicating that it is more-likely-than-not that no impairment occurred, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by determining the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its book value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. If the book value exceeds fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss equal to the difference between book value and fair value.\n\nFor  further  discussion  of  goodwill  and  goodwill  impairment  losses  recognized  refer  to  Note  12, Goodwill  and  Other Intangibles.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  using  the  liability  method  in  accordance  with  ASC  740, Income  Taxes, or ASC 740, which requires that the Company use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant temporary differences.\n\nThe Company has two categories of income tax expense or benefit - current and deferred, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Current income tax expense or benefit consists solely of current taxes payable less applicable tax credits, and\n- \u00b7 Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the change in the net deferred income tax asset or liability, excluding amounts charged or credited to accumulated other comprehensive income",

        "page_content": "The Company reports some of its revenues and expenses differently for financial statement purposes than for income tax return purposes, resulting in temporary and permanent differences between the Company's financial statements and income tax returns. The tax effects of such temporary differences are recorded as either deferred income tax assets or deferred income tax liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company measures its deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities using income tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the deferred tax is realized.\n\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which applies to all tax positions related to  income  taxes.  Under  ASC  740,  tax  benefits  are  recognized  when  it  is  more-likely-than-not  that  a  tax  position  will  be sustained  upon  examination  by  the  authorities.  The  benefit  recognized  from  a  position  is  the  amount  of  benefit  that  has surpassed  the  more-likely-than-not  threshold,  as  it  is  more  than  50%  likely  to  be  realized  upon  settlement.  The  Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n\nIn  accordance  with  ASC 740 and as discussed further in Note 20, Income Taxes ,  changes  to  existing  net  deferred  tax assets or valuation allowances or changes to uncertain tax benefits, are recorded to income tax (benefit)/expense.\n\n## Contract and Emission Credit Amortization\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  recognized  through  acquisitions  related  to  the  purchase  and  sale  of  energy  and  energy-related products  in  future  periods  for  which  the  fair  value  has  been  determined  to  be  significantly  less  or  more  than  market  are amortized to operating revenues or cost of operations over the term of each underlying contract based on actual generation and/ or contracted volumes.\n\nEmission credits represent the right to generate a specified amount of emissions, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide, over a compliance period. Emission credits held for use are amortized to cost of operations based on the weighted average cost of the allowances held.\n\n## Lease Revenue\n\nCertain of the Company's revenues are obtained through leases of rooftop residential solar systems, which are accounted for  as  operating  leases  in  accordance  with  ASC  842, Leases. Pursuant  to  the  lease  agreements,  the  customers'  monthly payments  are  pre-determined  fixed  monthly  amounts  and  may  include  an  annual  fixed  percentage  escalation  to  reflect  the impact  of  utility  rate  increases  over  the  lease  term,  which  is  20  years.  The  Company  records  operating  lease  revenue  on  a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term. Certain customers made initial down payments that are being amortized over the life of the lease. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue.\n\n## Lessor Accounting\n\nCertain of the Company's revenues are obtained through PPAs or other contractual agreements. Many of these agreements are accounted for as operating leases under ASC 842 .\n\n## Gross Receipts and Sales Taxes\n\nIn  connection  with  its  retail  sales,  the  Company  records  gross  receipts  taxes  on  a  gross  basis  in  revenues  and  cost  of operations  in  its  consolidated  statements  of  operations.  During  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  the Company's  revenues  and  cost  of  operations  included  gross  receipts  taxes  of  $184  million,  $107  million  and  $109  million, respectively.  Additionally,  the  Company  records  sales  taxes  collected  from  its  taxable  retail  customers  and  remitted  to  the various governmental entities on a net basis; thus, there is no impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations.\n\n## Cost of Operations\n\nCost of operations includes cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emission credit amortization, operations and maintenance, and other cost of operations.\n\n## Cost of Fuel, Purchased Energy and Other Cost of Sales\n\nCost of fuel is primarily the costs associated with procurement, transportation and storage of natural gas, oil and coal to operate the generation portfolio, which is expensed as the fuel is consumed. Purchased energy primarily relates to purchases to supply  the  Company's  customer  base,  which  includes  spot  market  purchases,  as  well  as  contracts  of  various  quantities  and durations, including renewable purchased power agreements under PPAs with third-party developers, which are accounted for as NPNS (see further discussion in Derivative Financial Instruments below). Other cost of sales primarily consists of TDSP expenses.\n\nThe cost of fuel is based on actual and estimated fuel usage for the applicable reporting period. The cost to deliver energy and related services to customers is based on actual and estimated supply volumes for the applicable reporting period. A portion of the cost of energy, $189 million, $98 million and $103 million as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, was accrued and consisted of estimated transmission and distribution charges not yet billed by the transmission and distribution utilities.",

        "page_content": "In  estimating  supply  volumes,  the  Company  considers  the  effects  of  historical  customer  volumes,  weather  factors  and usage by customer class. Transmission and distribution delivery fees are estimated using the same method used for electricity sales and services to retail customers. In addition, ISO fees are estimated based on historical trends, estimated supply volumes and initial ERCOT ISO settlements. Volume estimates are then multiplied by the supply rate and recorded as cost of operations in the applicable reporting period.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments under ASC 815, which requires the Company to record all derivatives on  the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value  and  changes  in  fair  value  in  earnings,  unless  they  qualify  for  the  NPNS  exception.  The Company's primary derivative instruments are power and natural gas purchase or sales contracts, fuels purchase contracts and other energy related commodities used to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuation in market prices. In addition, in order  to  mitigate  foreign  exchange  risk  associated  with  the  purchase  of  USD  denominated  natural  gas  for  the  Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company did not have derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow or fair value or hedge.\n\nRevenues and expenses on contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized when the underlying physical transaction is delivered. While these contracts are considered derivative instruments under ASC 815, they are not recorded at fair value, but on an accrual basis of accounting. If it is determined that a transaction designated as NPNS no longer meets the scope exception, the fair value of the related contract is recorded on the balance sheet and immediately recognized through earnings.\n\nNRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.\n\n## Mark-to-Market for Economic Hedging Activities\n\nNRG enters into derivative instruments to manage price and delivery risk, optimize physical and contractual assets in the portfolio and manage working capital requirements. The mark-to-market for economic hedging activities are recognized to cost of operations during the reporting period.\n\n## Operations and Maintenance and Other Cost of Operations\n\nOperations and maintenance costs include major and other routine preventative (planned outage) and corrective (forced outage) maintenance activities to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the Company's generation portfolio in compliance with all local, state and federal requirements. Operations and maintenance costs are also costs associated with retaining and maintaining the Company's customer base, such as call center support, portfolio maintenance and data analytics. Other cost of operations primarily includes gross receipts taxes, insurance, property taxes and asset retirement obligation expense.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses\n\nThe local currencies are generally the functional currency of NRG's foreign operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates of exchange. Revenues, expenses, and cash flows are translated at the weighted-average  rates  of  exchange  for  the  period.  The  resulting  currency  translation  adjustments  are  not  included  in  the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the period, but are accumulated and reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity until sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the foreign entity takes place. Foreign currency transaction gains or losses are reported within other income/(expense) in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, amounts recognized as foreign currency transaction  gains/(losses)  were  immaterial.  The  Company's  cumulative  translation  adjustment  balances  as  of  December  31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $(8) million, $(2) million and $(13) million, respectively.\n\n## Concentrations of Credit Risk\n\nFinancial  instruments  which  potentially  subject  the  Company  to  concentrations  of  credit  risk  consist  primarily  of  trust funds, accounts receivable, notes receivable, derivatives, and investments in debt securities. Trust funds are held in accounts managed  by  experienced  investment  advisors.  Certain  accounts  receivable,  notes  receivable,  and  derivative  instruments  are concentrated within entities engaged in the energy industry. These industry concentrations may impact the Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. Receivables and other contractual arrangements are subject to collateral requirements under the terms of enabling agreements. However, the Company believes that the credit risk posed by industry concentration is offset by the diversification and creditworthiness of its customer base. See Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for  a  further discussion of derivative concentrations.",

        "page_content": "## Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nThe carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. See Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for a further discussion of fair value of financial instruments.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  AROs  in  accordance  with  ASC  410-20, Asset  Retirement  Obligations, or  ASC  410-20. Retirement obligations associated with long-lived assets included within the scope of ASC 410-20 are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws, statutes, and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel, and for which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event. ASC 410-20 requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for an ARO in the period in which it is incurred and a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.\n\nUpon initial recognition of a liability for an ARO, the Company capitalizes the asset retirement cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. Over time, the liability is accreted to its future value, while the  capitalized  cost  is  depreciated  over  the  useful  life  of  the  related  asset.  See  Note  14, Asset Retirement Obligations, for  a further discussion of AROs.\n\n## Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\n\nThe  Company  offers  pension  benefits  through  a  defined  benefit  pension  plan.  In  addition,  the  Company  provides postretirement  health  and  welfare  benefits  for  certain  groups  of  employees.  The  Company  accounts  for  pension  and  other postretirement  benefits  in  accordance  with  ASC  715, Compensation  -  Retirement  Benefits ,  or  ASC  715 . The  Company recognizes the funded status of the Company's defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position and records an offset for gains and losses as well as all prior service costs that have not been included as part of the Company's net periodic benefit cost  to  other  comprehensive  income.  The  determination  of  the  Company's  obligation  and  expenses  for  pension  benefits  is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions. These assumptions determined by management include the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. The Company's actuarial consultants assist in determining assumptions for such items as retirement age. The assumptions used may differ materially from actual results, which may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension obligation or expense recorded by the Company.\n\nThe Company measures the fair value of its pension assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  its  stock-based  compensation  in  accordance  with  ASC  718, Compensation  -  Stock Compensation, or ASC 718 . The fair value of the Company's performance stock units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  NRG  uses  the  Company's  common  stock  price  on  the  date  of  grant  as  the  fair  value  of  the Company's deferred stock units. The fair value of the Company's restricted stock units is derived from the closing price of NRG's  common  stock  at  the  grant  date.  Forfeiture  rates  are  estimated  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  Company's  historical forfeitures,  employment  turnover,  and  expected  future  behavior.  The  Company  recognizes  compensation  expense  for  both graded and cliff vesting awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\n\n## Investments Accounted for by the Equity Method\n\nThe Company has investments in various domestic energy projects, as well as one Australian project. The equity method of accounting is applied to such investments in affiliates, which include joint ventures and partnerships, because the ownership structure prevents the Company from exercising a controlling influence over the operating and financial policies of the projects. Under this method, equity in pre-tax income or losses of domestic partnerships and, generally, in the net income or losses of its Australian project, are reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from equity method investments that represent earnings on the Company's investment are included within cash flows from operating activities and distributions from  equity  method  investments  that  represent  a  return  of  the  Company's  investment  are  included  within  cash  flows  from investing activities.\n\n## Tax Equity Arrangements\n\nThe Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries represented third-party interests in the net assets under certain tax equity arrangements, which were consolidated by the Company, that had been entered into to finance the cost of solar  energy  systems  under  operating  leases.  The  Company  determined  that  the  provisions  in  the  contractual  agreements  of these structures represented substantive profit sharing arrangements. Further, the Company had determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the redeemable noncontrolling interest that reflected the substantive profit sharing arrangements was a balance sheet approach that utilized the HLBV method. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as redeemable",

        "page_content": "noncontrolling  interests  represented  the  amounts  the  investors  that  were  party  to  the  tax  equity  arrangements  would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the contractual agreements, assuming the net  assets  of  the  funding  structures  were  liquidated  at  their  recorded  amounts.  The  investors'  interests  in  the  results  of operations  of  the  funding  structures  were  determined  as  redeemable  noncontrolling  interests  at  the  start  and  end  of  each reporting  period,  after  taking  into  account  any  capital  transactions  between  the  structures  and  the  funds'  investors.  The calculations utilized to apply the HLBV method included estimated calculations of taxable income or losses for each reporting period. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company repurchased its partners' equity interest, which was the Company's last remaining tax equity arrangement.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nThe following table reflects the changes in the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interest balance for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                              | (In millions)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Balance as of December 31, 2018  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  19           |\n| Distributions to redeemable noncontrolling interest   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | (2)             |\n| Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest - continuing operations                                                                                        | 3               |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2019  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 20              |\n| Repurchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .         | (20)            |\n| Balance as of December 31, 2020  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  -            |\n\n## Sale-Leaseback Arrangements\n\nNRG is party to sale-leaseback arrangements that provide for the sale of certain assets to a third party and simultaneously leases back the same asset to the Company. If the seller-lessee transfers control of the underlying assets to the buyer-lessor, the arrangement is accounted for under ASC 842-40, Sale-Leaseback Transactions. These arrangements are classified as operating leases on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10, Leases, for further discussion.\n\n## Marketing and Advertising Costs\n\nThe Company expenses its marketing and advertising  costs  as  incurred  and  includes  them  within  selling,  general  and administrative expenses. The costs of tangible assets used in advertising campaigns are recorded as fixed assets or deferred advertising costs and amortized as advertising costs over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the advertising campaign. The  Company  has  several  long-term  sponsorship  arrangements.  Payments  related  to  these  arrangements  are  deferred  and expensed over the term of the arrangement. Advertising expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $109 million, $74 million and $66 million, respectively.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe Company accounts for its business combinations in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, or ASC 805, which requires an acquirer to recognize and measure in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company also recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired or a gain from a bargain purchase in the business combination. In addition, transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nIn recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations, the Company uses estimates based on the best information  available.  Estimates  are  used  for  such  items  as  plant  depreciable  lives,  tax  provisions,  uncollectible  accounts, actuarially determined benefit costs, the valuation of energy commodity contracts, environmental liabilities, legal costs incurred in connection with recorded loss contingencies, and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, among others. In addition, estimates are used to test long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and to determine the fair value of impaired  assets.  As  better  information  becomes  available  or  actual  amounts  are  determinable,  the  recorded  estimates  are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.",

        "page_content": "## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect results from operations, net assets or cash flows.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Adopted in 2021\n\nASU 2019-12 In  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying  the Accounting  for  Income  Taxes, or  ASU  2019-12,  to  simplify  various  aspects  related  to  accounting  for  income  taxes.  The guidance in ASU 2019-12 amends the general principles in Topic 740 to eliminate certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investment, performing intraperiod allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. This ASU also includes guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods  within  those  fiscal  years.  The  Company  adopted  the  amendments  effective  January  1,  2021  using  the  prospective approach. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations, statements of cash flows, or statement of financial position.\n\nASU 2021-10 - In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business  Entities  about  Government  Assistance ,  which  requires  additional  disclosures  for  transactions  with  a  government accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model by analogy, including: (i) the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transactions; (ii) the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected by the transactions, and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item; and (iii) significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. The amendments were applied prospectively to all transactions within the scope of the amendments. Early application of the new standard is permitted and the effect of the new standard only impacted the Company's financial statement disclosures.\n\n## Recent Accounting Developments - Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nASU 2020-06 - In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , or ASU 2020-06. The guidance in ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves and amends the related earnings per share guidance. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective approach. As a result of the provisions of the amended guidance, the Company estimates a $100 million decrease to  additional  paid-in  capital,  a  $57  million  decrease  to  debt  discount,  a  $57  million  increase  to  retained  earnings,  and  a $14 million decrease to long-term deferred tax liabilities. The Company does not expect the adoptions of ASU 2020-06 to have a material impact on its statement of operations, statements of cash flows or earnings per share amounts.\n\nASU 2021-08 - In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for  Contract  Assets  and  Contract  Liabilities  from  Contracts  with  Customers ,  or  ASU  2021-08.  Under  current  GAAP,  an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract  liabilities  arising  from  revenue  contracts  with  customers  and  other  similar  contracts  that  are  accounted  for  in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ,  or  ASC 606, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606. At the acquisition date, an acquirer should account for the related revenue contracts in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts, which should generally result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  consistent  with  how  they  were  recognized  and  measured  in  the  acquiree's financial  statements.  This  update  also  provides  certain  practical  expedients  for  acquirers  when  recognizing  and  measuring acquired  contract  assets  and  contract  liabilities  from  revenue  contracts  in  a  business  combination.  The  amendments  in  this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years and should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption  is  permitted,  including  adoption  in  an  interim  period.  Adoption  during  an  interim  period  requires  retrospective application to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurs on or after the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period of early application and prospectively to all business combinations that occur on or after the date of initial application. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2021-08 to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3 -Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's policies with respect to its various revenue streams are detailed below. The Company generally applies the invoicing practical expedient to recognize revenue for the revenue streams detailed below, except in circumstances where the invoiced amount does not represent the value transferred to the customer.\n\n## Retail Revenue\n\nGross revenues for energy sales and services to retail customers are recognized as the Company transfers the promised goods and services to the customer. For the majority of its electricity and natural gas contracts, the Company's performance obligation with the customer is satisfied over time and performance obligations for its electricity and natural gas products are recognized as the customer takes possession of the product. The Company also allocates the contract consideration to distinct performance  obligations  in  a  contract  for  which  the  timing  of  the  revenue  recognized  is  different.  Additionally,  customer discounts and incentives reduce the contract consideration and are recognized over the term of the contract.\n\nEnergy sales and services that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated. Accrued unbilled revenues are based on estimates of customer usage since the date of the last meter reading provided by the independent system operators, utilities, or electric distribution companies. Volume estimates are based on daily forecasted volumes and estimated customer usage  by  class.  Unbilled  revenues  are  calculated  by  multiplying  these  volume  estimates  by  the  applicable  rate  by  customer class. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\n\nAs contracts for retail electricity and natural gas can be for multi-year periods, the Company has performance obligations under these contracts that have not yet been satisfied. These performance obligations have transaction prices that are both fixed and variable, and that vary based on the contract duration, customer type, inception date and other contract-specific factors. For the fixed price contracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performance obligations will vary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors such as weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable to estimate such amounts.\n\n## Energy Revenue\n\nBoth physical and financial transactions consist of revenues billed to a third party at either market or negotiated contract terms to optimize the financial performance of the Company's generating facilities. Electric energy revenue is recognized upon transmission  to  the  customer  over  time,  using  the  output  method  for  measuring  progress  of  satisfaction  of  performance obligations. Physical transactions, or the sale of generated electricity to meet supply and demand, are recorded on a gross basis in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing energy revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is recognized based on the invoiced amount which is equal to the value to the customer of NRG's performance obligation completed to date. Financial transactions used to hedge the sale of electricity are recorded net within operating revenues in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with ASC 815.\n\nAncillary revenues, included in Other revenue, are recognized over time as the obligation is fulfilled, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations.\n\n## Capacity Revenue\n\nThe  Company's  largest  sources  of  capacity  revenues  are  capacity  auctions  in  PJM,  ISO-NE  and  NYISO.  Capacity revenues  also  include  revenues  billed  to  a  third  party  at  either  market  or  negotiated  contract  terms  for  making  installed generation and demand response capacity available in order to satisfy system integrity and reliability requirements. Capacity revenues are recognized over time, using the output method for measuring progress of satisfaction of performance obligations. The Company applies the invoicing practical expedient in recognizing capacity revenue. Under the practical expedient, revenue is  recognized  based  on  the  invoiced  amount  which  is  equal  to  the  value  to  the  customer  of  NRG's  performance  obligation completed to date.\n\n## Performance Obligations\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  estimated  future  fixed  fee  performance  obligations  are  $258  million,  $48  million  and $1 million for fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024, respectively. These performance obligations are for cleared auction MWs in the PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO and MISO capacity auctions and are subject to penalties for non-performance.",

The  change  in deferred revenue balances during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was primarily due to the timing difference of when consideration was received and when the performance obligation was transferred.\n\nThe Company's customer acquisition costs consist of broker fees, commission payments and other costs that represent incremental costs of obtaining the contract with customers for which the Company expects to recover. The Company amortizes these amounts over the estimated life of the customer contract. As a practical expedient, the Company expenses the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period of the asset would have been one year or less.\n\nWhen the Company receives consideration from the customer that is in excess of the amount due, such consideration is reclassified  to  deferred  revenue,  which  represents  a  contract  liability.  Generally,  the  Company  will  recognize  revenue  from contract liabilities in the next period as the Company satisfies its performance obligations.\n\n## Note 4 Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Direct Energy Acquisition\n\nOn January 5, 2021 (the \"Acquisition Closing Date\"), the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Direct Energy, which had been a North American subsidiary of Centrica plc. Direct Energy is a leading retail provider of electricity, natural gas, and home and business energy related products and services in North America, with operations in all 50 U.S. states and 8 Canadian provinces. The acquisition increased NRG's retail portfolio by over 3 million customers and strengthens its integrated model. It also broadens the Company's presence in the Northeast and into states and locales where it did not previously operate, supporting NRG's objective to diversify its business.\n\nThe  Company  paid  an  aggregate  purchase  price  of  $3.625  billion  in  cash,  subject  to  a  purchase  price  adjustment  of $77 million. The Company funded the purchase price using a combination of $715 million of cash on hand, $166 million from a draw on its Revolving Credit Facility (of which $107 million was used to fund acquisition costs and financing fees that are not included in the aggregate purchase price above) as well as approximately $2.9 billion in secured and unsecured corporate debt issued in December 2020. The final purchase price adjustment resulted in additional payment of $22 million, which was paid in December 2021.",

unobservable in the market and thus represent Level 2 and Level 3 measurements, respectively. Significant inputs were as follows:\n\nCustomer  relationships -Customer  relationships,  reflective  of  Direct  Energy's  customer  base,  were  valued  using  an excess earning method of the income approach. Under this approach, the Company estimated the present value of expected future cash flows resulting from existing customer relationships, considering attrition and charges for contributory assets (such as net working capital, fixed assets, workforce and trade names) utilized in the business, discounted at an independent power producer  peer  group's  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  The  customer  relationships  are  amortized  to  depreciation  and amortization, ratably based on discounted future cash flows. The weighted average amortization period is 12 years.",

        "page_content": "Customer and supply contracts -The  fair  value  of  in-market  and  out-of-market  customer  and  supply  contracts  were estimated  based  on  contractual  terms  compared  to  market  prices  as  of  the  Acquisition  Closing  Date.  The  majority  of  the contracts were valued using prices provided by external sources, primarily price quotations available through broker or overthe-counter and online exchanges. For contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes were not available, these values were based on valuation techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on fundamental analysis of the  market and extrapolation of the observable market data with similar characteristics. In addition, the Company applied a credit  reserve  to  reflect  credit  risk,  which  is  calculated  based  on  published  default  probabilities.  The  customer  and  supply contracts are amortized to revenue and cost of operations, respectively, based upon the fair market value, as of the acquisition date, for each delivery month. The weighted average amortization period is 14 years.\n\nTrade  names -Trade  names  were  valued  using  a  \"relief  from  royalty\"  method  of  the  income  approach.  Under  this approach, the fair value is estimated to be the present value of royalties saved because NRG owns the intangible asset and therefore  does  not  have  to  pay  a  royalty  for  its  use.  The  trade  names  are  amortized  to  depreciation  and  amortization,  on  a straight line basis, over a weighted average amortization period of 15 years.\n\nRenewable energy credits -Renewable  energy  credits  were  valued  based  on  the  market  prices  as  of  the  Acquisition Closing Date. Renewable energy credits are retired, as required, for the applicable compliance period. They are expensed to cost of operations based on customer usage.\n\n## Fair Value Measurement of Derivative Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair values of derivatives assets and liabilities as of the Acquisition Closing Date were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                   | Fair Value   | Fair Value   | Fair Value   | Fair Value   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                     | Total        | Level 1      | Level 2      | Level 3      |\n| Derivatives assets  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  1,545     | $  155       | $  1,272     | $  118       |\n| Derivatives liabilities                                                                                           | 1,828        | 207          | 1,489        | 132          |\n\nRefer to Note 5 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments for discussion on derivative fair value measurements.\n\n## Supplemental Information\n\nFor  the  Year Ended December 31, 2021 Direct Energy contributed revenue and income before income taxes of $15.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.\n\n## Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\n\nThe following table provides unaudited pro forma combined financial information of NRG and Direct Energy, after giving effect to the Direct Energy acquisition and related financing transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2019.

The Company recorded a gain of $210 million from the sale, which includes the $39 million indemnification liability recorded as discussed below. As part of the transaction, NRG entered into a tolling agreement for the 866 MW Arthur Kill plant in New York City through April 2025.\n\nAs part of the agreement to sell the fossil generating assets, NRG has agreed to indemnify Generation Bridge for certain future environmental compliance costs up to $39 million. The indemnity term will expire on December 1, 2028. The Company has recorded the liability within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities.\n\n## Sale of Agua Caliente\n\nOn  February  3,  2021,  the  Company  closed  on  the  sale  of  its  35%  ownership  in  the  Agua  Caliente  solar  project  to Clearway  Energy,  Inc.  for  $202  million.

The Company concluded that the divested business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as the disposition represented a strategic shift in the business in which NRG operates. In connection with the transaction, NRG also entered into a transition services agreement to provide certain corporate services to the divested business, which have been substantially completed in 2020.\n\nThe South Central Portfolio includes the 1,177 MW Cottonwood natural gas generating facility. Upon the closing of the sale  of  the  South  Central  Portfolio,  NRG  entered  into  a  lease  agreement  with  Cleco  to  leaseback  the  Cottonwood  facility through 2025. Due to its continuing involvement with the Cottonwood facility, NRG did not use held-for-sale or discontinued operations treatment in accounting for the Cottonwood facility.\n\nSummarized results of South Central discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                    | (In millions)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Operating revenues   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  31           |\n| Operating costs and expenses   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | (23)            |\n| Gain from operations of discontinued components  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | 8               |\n| Gain on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                    | 20              |\n| Gain from discontinued operations, including disposal, net of tax                                                                                                                  | $  28           |\n\n## Sale of Ownership in NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform\n\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interests in NRG Yield, Inc. and its Renewables Platform to GIP for total cash consideration of $1.348 billion. The Company concluded that the divested businesses met the criteria for discontinued operations, as the dispositions represented a strategic shift in the business in which NRG operates. In connection with the transaction, NRG entered into a transition services agreement to provide certain corporate services to the divested businesses in 2018, which concluded in 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an adjustment to reduce the purchase price by $15 million in connection with the completion of the Patriot Wind project. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reduced the liability related to the indemnification of NRG Yield for any increase in property taxes for certain solar properties by $22 million due to updated estimates.\n\n## Carlsbad\n\nOn February 6, 2018, NRG entered into an agreement with NRG Yield and GIP to sell 100% of its membership interests in Carlsbad Energy Holdings LLC, which owns the Carlsbad project, for $385 million of cash consideration, excluding working capital adjustments. The primary condition to close the Carlsbad transaction was the completion of the sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. At the time of the sale of NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform in August 2018, the Company concluded that the Carlsbad project met the criteria for discontinued operations and accordingly, all current and prior period results for Carlsbad were reclassified as discontinued operations. The transaction closed on February 27, 2019. Carlsbad will continue  to  have  a  ground  lease  and  easement  agreement  with  NRG  with  an  initial  term  ending  in  2039  and  two  ten-year extensions. As a result of the transaction, additional commitments related to the project totaled $23 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\n\nSummarized  results  of  NRG  Yield,  Inc.  and  Renewables  Platform  and  Carlsbad  discontinued  operations  for  the  year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows:\n\n(In millions)\n\n| Operating revenues   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  19   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Operating costs and expenses   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | (9)     |\n| Other expenses    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | (5)     |\n| Gain/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | 5       |\n| Gain/(loss) on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                          | 265     |\n| Income/(expense) from California property tax indemnification   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                               | 22      |\n| Income/(expense) from other commitments, indemnification and fees   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                     | 4       |\n| Income/(loss) on disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                   | 291     |\n| Income/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                             | $  296  |",

As a result of the bankruptcy filings, NRG concluded that it no longer controlled GenOn as it was subject to the control of the Texas Bankruptcy Court; and accordingly, NRG deconsolidated GenOn and its subsidiaries for financial  reporting  purposes  as  of  such  date.  For  the  Year  Ended  December  31,  2019  NRG  recorded  $3  million  loss  from discontinued operations, net of tax for GenOn results of operations.\n\n## Note 5 Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFor cash and cash equivalents, funds deposited by counterparties, restricted cash, accounts and other receivables, accounts payable, restricted cash, and cash collateral paid and received in support of energy risk management activities, the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of those instruments and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe estimated carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt, including current portion, is as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                   | 2021                      | 2021                      |                           |                           |\n| (In millions)                                                     | Carrying Amount           | Fair Value                | Carrying Amount           | Fair Value                |\n| Long-term debt, including current portion  (a)  . . . . . . . . . | $  8,040                  | $  8,327                  | $  8,781                  | $  9,446                  |\n\n(a) Excludes deferred financing costs, which are recorded as a reduction to long-term debt on the Company's consolidated balance sheets\n\nThe fair value of the Company's publicly-traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices and is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Fair Value Accounting under ASC 820\n\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability  to  access  as  of  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  1  inputs  include active exchange-traded securities, energy derivatives, and trust fund investments.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly observable for the asset or liability or  indirectly  observable  through  corroboration  with  observable  market  data.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include fixed income securities, exchange-based derivatives, and over the counter derivatives such as swaps, options and forward contracts.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability only used when there is little, if any, market activity for the asset  or  liability  at  the  measurement  date.  NRG's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  utilizing  Level  3  inputs  include infrequently-traded,  non-exchange-based  derivatives  and  commingled  investment  funds,  and  are  measured  using present value pricing models.\n\nIn accordance with ASC 820, the Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement in its entirety falls, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.",

These  trust  fund investments hold debt and equity securities directly and equity securities indirectly through commingled funds. The fair values of equity securities held directly by the trust funds are based on quoted prices in active markets and are categorized in Level 1. In addition, U.S. government and federal agency obligations are categorized as Level 1 because they trade in a highly liquid and transparent market. The fair values of corporate debt securities are based on evaluated prices that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information of similar securities, adjusted for observable differences and are categorized in Level 2. Certain equity securities, classified as commingled funds, are analogous to mutual funds, are maintained by investment companies,  and  hold  certain  investments  in  accordance  with  a  stated  set  of  fund  objectives.  The  fair  value  of  the  equity securities classified as commingled funds are based on net asset values per fund share (the unit of account), derived from the quoted prices in active markets of the underlying equity securities. However, because the shares in the commingled funds are not publicly quoted, not traded in an active market and are subject to certain restrictions regarding their purchase and sale, the commingled funds are measured using net asset value practical expedient. See also Note 7, Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund.\n\n## Derivative fair value measurements\n\nA  portion  of  the  Company's  contracts  are  exchange-traded  contracts  with  readily  available  quoted  market  prices.  A majority  of  NRG's  contracts  are  non-exchange-traded  contracts  valued  using  prices  provided  by  external  sources,  primarily price quotations available through brokers or over-the-counter and on-line exchanges. For the majority of NRG markets, the Company receives quotes from multiple sources. To the extent that NRG receives multiple quotes, the Company's prices reflect the average of the bid-ask mid-point prices obtained from all sources that NRG believes provide the most liquid market for the commodity. If the Company receives one quote, then the mid-point of the bid-ask spread for that quote is used. The terms for which such price information is available vary by commodity, region and product. A significant portion of the fair value of the Company's  derivative  portfolio  is  based  on  price  quotes  from  brokers  in  active  markets  who  regularly  facilitate  those transactions and the Company believes such price quotes are executable. The Company does not use third party sources that derive price based on proprietary models or market surveys. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represents contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including but not limited to internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Contracts  valued  with  prices  provided  by  models  and  other  valuation techniques make up 6% of derivative assets and 3% of derivative liabilities. The fair value of each contract is discounted using a  risk  free  interest  rate.  In  addition,  the  Company  applies  a  credit  reserve  to  reflect  credit  risk,  which  for  foreign  exchange contracts  and  interest  rate  swaps  is  calculated  utilizing  the  bilateral  method  based  on  published  default  probabilities.  For commodities,  to  the  extent  that  NRG's  net  exposure  under  a  specific  master  agreement  is  an  asset,  the  Company  uses  the counterparty's  default  swap  rate.  If  the  exposure  under  a  specific  master  agreement  is  a  liability,  the  Company  uses  NRG's default  swap  rate.  For  foreign  exchange  contracts,  interest  rate  swaps  and  commodities,  the  credit  reserve  is  added  to  the",

As of December 31, 2021 the credit reserve resulted in a $11 million decrease primarily within cost of operations. As of December 31, 2020 the credit reserve resulted in $2 million increase primarily within cost of operations.\n\nThe fair values in each category reflect the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of December 31, 2021, and may change as a result of changes in these factors. Management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts NRG holds and sells. These estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and overthe-counter price quotations, time value, volatility factors and credit exposure. It is possible, however, that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities from energy marketing and trading activities and such variations could be material.\n\nNRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial natural gas and power executed in illiquid markets as well as financial transmission rights, or FTRs. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid natural gas and power location pricing which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value.\n\nThe  following  tables  quantify  the  significant  unobservable  inputs  used  in  developing  the  fair  value  of  the

The Company has chosen not to offset positions as defined in ASC 815. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $291 million of cash collateral posted and $845 million of cash collateral received on its balance sheet.\n\n## Concentration of Credit Risk\n\nIn addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , the following item is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's financial instruments. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; (ii)  a  daily  monitoring  of  counterparties'  credit  limits;  (iii)  the  use  of  credit  mitigation  measures  such  as  margin,  collateral, prepayment arrangements, or volumetric limits; (iv) the use of payment netting agreements; and (v) the use of master netting agreements  that  allow  for  the  netting  of  positive  and  negative  exposures  of  various  contracts  associated  with  a  single counterparty.  Risks  surrounding  counterparty  performance  and  credit  could  ultimately  impact  the  amount  and  timing  of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. The Company also has credit protection within various agreements to call on additional collateral support if and when necessary. Cash margin is collected and held at the Company to cover the credit risk of the counterparty until positions settle.\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  counterparty  credit  exposure,  excluding  credit  exposure  from  RTOs,  ISOs,  and  registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was $2.2 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of $598 million, resulting in a net exposure of $1.6 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 87% of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2023. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. The following  tables  highlight  net  counterparty  credit  exposure  by  industry  sector  and  by  counterparty  credit  quality.  Net counterparty  credit  exposure  is  defined  as  the  aggregate  net  asset  position  for  NRG  with  counterparties  where  netting  is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held, and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.\n\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                 | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Utilities, energy merchants, marketers and other                                                                                                                                         | 67 %                                 |\n| Financial institutions  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 33                                   |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n| Category                                                                                                                                                                                 | Net Exposure  (a) (b) (% of Total)   |\n| Investment grade  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 55 %                                 |\n| Non-Investment grade/Non-Rated   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | 45                                   |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 100 %                                |\n\nThe Company currently has no exposure to wholesale counterparties in excess of 10% of the total net exposure discussed above as of December 31, 2021.

        "page_content": "During Winter Storm Uri, the Company experienced nonperformance by a counterparty in one of its bilateral financial hedging transactions, resulting in exposure of $403 million. The Company is pursuing all means available to enforce its rights under  this  transaction  but,  given  the  size  of  the  exposure,  cannot  determine  with  certainty  what  the  amount  of  its  ultimate recovery will be. The full exposure was recorded as a provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## RTOs and ISOs\n\nThe Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in these markets is approved by FERC, or in the case of ERCOT, approved by the PUCT and includes credit  policies  that,  under  certain  circumstances,  require  that  losses  arising  from  the  default  of  one  member  on  spot  market transactions  be  shared  by  the  remaining  participants.  As  a  result,  the  counterparty  credit  risk  to  these  markets  is  limited  to NRG's share of overall market and are excluded from the above exposures.\n\n## Exchange Traded Transactions\n\nThe  Company  enters  into  commodity  transactions  on  registered  exchanges,  notably  ICE,  NYMEX  and  Nodal.  These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk.\n\n## Long-Term Contracts\n\nCounterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long term contracts, primarily solar PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market  and  extrapolation  of  observable  market  data  with  similar  characteristics.  Based  on  these  valuation  techniques,  as  of December 31, 2021, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately $1.1 billion for the next five years.\n\n## Retail Customer Credit Risk\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  retail  credit  risk  through  the  Company's  retail  electricity  and  gas  providers,  which  serve Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both nonpayment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies that include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  the  Company's  retail  customer  credit  exposure  to  Home  and  Business  customers  was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. The Company is also subject to risk with respect to its residential solar customers. The Company's provision for credit losses was $698 million, $108 million, and $95  million  for  the  years  ending  December  31,  2021,  2020,  and  2019,  respectively.  As  a  result  of  Winter  Storm  Uri,  the Company incurred additional credit losses from Business customers primarily due to a segment of customers whose contracts included a pass through of wholesale power prices which were significantly escalated during the storm and from customers who failed to meet their obligations in ERCOT load curtailment programs.\n\n## Note 6 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nASC 815 requires the Company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities and to measure them at fair value each reporting period unless they qualify for a NPNS exception. The Company may elect to designate  certain  derivatives  as  cash  flow  hedges,  if  certain  conditions  are  met,  and  defer  the  change  in  fair  value  of  the derivatives to accumulated OCI, until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings.\n\nFor derivatives that are not designated as cash flow hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in the fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings. Certain derivative instruments may qualify for the NPNS exception and are therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment. ASC 815 applies to NRG's energy related commodity contracts, foreign exchange contracts, and interest rate swaps.\n\nAs the Company engages principally in the trading and marketing of its generation assets and retail operations, some of NRG's  commercial  activities  qualify  for  NPNS  accounting.  Most  of  the  retail  load  contracts  either  qualify  for  the  NPNS exception or fail to meet the criteria for a derivative and the majority of the retail supply and fuels supply contracts are recorded under mark-to-market accounting. All of NRG's hedging and trading activities are subject to limits within the Company's Risk Management Policy.",

This combination of instruments allows NRG to sell out-year volatility through call options in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time. The above-market swap combined with its later-year call option are priced in aggregate at market at the trade's inception; and\n- \u00b7 Weather derivative products used to mitigate a portion of lost revenue due to weather.\n\nThe objectives for entering into derivative contracts designated as hedges include:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated power and gas purchases for the Company's retail sales;\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales that provides an acceptable return on the Company's electric generation operations; and\n- \u00b7 Fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of the Company's power plants.\n\nThese contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, NRG's derivative assets and liabilities consisted primarily of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase/sale of electricity and related products economically hedging NRG's generation assets' forecasted output or NRG's retail load obligations through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Forward and financial contracts for the purchase of fuel commodities relating to the forecasted usage of NRG's generation assets through 2024;\n- \u00b7 Other energy derivatives instruments extending through 2029.\n\nAlso, as of December 31, 2021, NRG had other energy-related contracts that did not meet the definition of a derivative instrument or qualified for the NPNS exception and were therefore exempt from fair value accounting treatment as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward electric sale contracts extending through 2036;\n- \u00b7 Load-following forward natural gas sale contracts extending through 2032;\n- \u00b7 Power tolling contracts through 2038;\n- \u00b7 Coal purchase contracts through 2023;\n- \u00b7 Power transmission contracts through 2025;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas transportation contracts through 2034;\n- \u00b7 Natural gas storage agreements through 2025; and\n- \u00b7 Coal transportation contracts through 2029.\n\n## Interest Rate Swaps\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, NRG entered into $1.6 billion of interest rate hedges associated with anticipated certain financing needs. As of December 31, 2020, the interest rate hedges were settled in connection with the issuance of fixed rate debt, resulting in a gain of $11 million that was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Contracts\n\nIn order to mitigate foreign exchange risk primarily associated with the purchase of USD denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements through 2025.",

Option contracts are reflected using delta volume. Delta volume equals the notional volume of an option adjusted for the probability that the option will be in-the-money at its expiration date.\n\n| (In millions)                  |                                                                                | Total Volume      | Total Volume      |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Commodity                      | Units                                                                          | December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020 |\n| Emissions                      | Short Ton   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 1                 | 1                 |\n| Renewables Energy Certificates | Certificates                                                                   | 13                | 5                 |\n| Coal                           | Short Ton   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 19                | 2                 |\n| Natural Gas                    | MMBtu   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 813               | (286)             |\n| Oil                            | Barrels  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 1                 | -                 |\n| Power                          | MWh  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 185               | 57                |\n| Capacity                       | MW/Day  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | -                 | (1)               |\n| Foreign Exchange               | Dollars   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .          | 279               | -                 |\n\nThe increase in positions is primarily the result of Direct Energy acquisition.\n\n## Fair Value of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value within the derivative instrument valuation on the balance sheet:\n\nFair Value\n\n|                                                                                                                                                            | Derivative Assets   | Derivative Assets   | Derivative Liabilities   | Derivative Liabilities   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                                                              | December 31,  2021  | December 31,  2020  | December 31,  2021       | December 31,  2020       |\n| Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value  Hedges :                                                                                            |                     |                     |                          |                          |\n| Foreign exchange contracts - current  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                      | $  -                | $  -                | $  1                     | $  -                     |\n| Foreign exchange contracts - long-term  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                        | 1                   | -                   | -                        | -                        |\n| Commodity contracts- current   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                   | 4,613               | 560                 | 3,386                    | 499                      |\n| Commodity contracts- long-term  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                      | 2,526               | 261                 | 1,412                    | 385                      |\n| Total Derivatives Not Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value  Hedges  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  7,140            | $  821              | $  4,799                 | $  884                   |\n\nThe Company has elected to present derivative assets and liabilities on the balance sheet on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level.

        "page_content": "## Credit Risk Related Contingent Features\n\nCertain of the Company's hedging and trading agreements contain provisions that entitle the counterparty to demand that the Company post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in the Company's credit quality, generally termed 'adequate assurance' under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there  were  a  downgrade  in  the  Company's  credit  rating.  In  addition,  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy  from Centrica,  certain  of  the  Company's  agreements  as  of  December  31,  2021,  were  still  supported  by  credit  support  posted  by Centrica,  and  as  a  result  could  require  the  Company  to  post  collateral  upon  a  deterioration  or  downgrade  of  Centrica.  The collateral potentially required for contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in net liability positions as of December 31, 2021 was $1.0 billion. The Company is also a party to certain marginable agreements under which it has a net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately $70 million as of December 31, 2021. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, $1 million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSee Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, for discussion regarding concentration of credit risk.\n\n## Note 7 Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund\n\nNRG's  Nuclear  Decommissioning  Trust  Fund  assets,  which  are  for  the  decommissioning  of  STP,  are  comprised  of securities classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value based on actively quoted market prices. Although NRG is responsible  for  managing  the  decommissioning  of  its  44%  interest  in  STP,  the  predecessor  utilities  that  owned  STP  are authorized by the PUCT to collect decommissioning funds from their ratepayers to cover decommissioning costs on behalf of NRG. NRC requirements determine the decommissioning cost estimate which is the minimum required level of funding. In the event  that  funds  from  the  ratepayers  that  accumulate  in  the  nuclear  decommissioning  trust  are  ultimately  determined  to  be inadequate to decommission the STP facilities, the utilities will be required to collect through rates charged to rate payers all additional amounts, with no obligation from NRG, provided that NRG has complied with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts. Following completion of the decommissioning, if surplus funds remain in the decommissioning trusts, any excess will be refunded to the respective ratepayers of the utilities.\n\nNRG accounts for the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund in accordance with ASC 980, Regulated Operations , or ASC 980, because the Company's nuclear decommissioning activities are subject to approval by the PUCT, with regulated rates that are  designed  to  recover  all  decommissioning  costs  and  that  can  be  charged  to  and  collected  from  the  ratepayers  per  PUCT mandate. Since the Company is in compliance with PUCT rules and regulations regarding decommissioning trusts and the cost of  decommissioning  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Texas  ratepayers,  not  NRG,  all  realized  and  unrealized  gains  or  losses (including other-than-temporary impairments) related to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust Fund are recorded to the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust liability and are not included in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income, consistent with regulatory treatment.\n\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the trust funds, as well as information about the contractual maturities of those securities.\n\n|                                                                                              | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2021                 | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020   | As of December 31, 2020                 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions, except otherwise noted)                                                        | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) | Fair Value                | Unrealized Gains          | Unrealized Losses         | Weighted- average maturities (in years) |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   . . . . . . . . . . .                                            | $  33                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       | $  23                     | $  -                      | $  -                      | -                                       |\n| U.S. government and federal agency  obligations    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 112                       | 5                         | 1                         | 10                                      | 70                        | 6                         | -                         | 10                                      |\n| Federal agency mortgage-backed  securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 100                       | 2                         | -                         | 25                                      | 89                        | 4                         | -                         | 24                                      |\n| Commercial mortgage-backed securities                                                        | 44                        | 1                         | -                         | 27                                      | 36                        | 2                         | -                         | 27                                      |\n| Corporate debt securities   . . . . . . . . . . . .                                          | 122                       | 7                         | 1                         | 14                                      | 144                       | 13                        | -                         | 12                                      |\n| Equity securities   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                    | 593                       | 456                       | -                         | -                                       | 521                       | 372                       | -                         | -                                       |\n| Foreign government fixed income  securities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 4                         | -                         | -                         | 13                                      | 7                         | 1                         | -                         | 10                                      |\n| Total   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                              | $ 1,008                   | $  471                    | $  2                      |                                         | $  890                    | $  398                    | $  -                      |                                         |",

further described in  Note  11, Asset  Impairments. Depreciation expense of property, plant and equipment recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $384 million, $295 million and $271 million, respectively.\n\n## Note 10 -Leases\n\nThe Company leases generating facilities, land, office and equipment, railcars, fleet vehicles and storefront space at retail stores. Operating leases with an initial term greater than twelve months are recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company made an accounting policy election, as permitted by ASC 842, for all asset classes not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for its short-term leases, which are leases that have a lease term of twelve months or less. For the initial measurement of lease liabilities, the discount rate that the Company uses is either the rate implicit in the lease, if known, or its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term an amount equal to the payments for the lease. The Company recognizes lease expense for all operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In the future, should another systematic basis become more representative of the pattern in which the lessee expects to consume the remaining economic benefit of the right-of-use asset, the Company will use that basis for lease expense.\n\nThe Company considers a contract to be or to contain a lease when both of the following conditions apply: 1) an asset is either explicitly or implicitly identified in the contract and 2) the contract conveys to the Company the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time. The Company has the right to control the use of the identified asset when the Company",

        "page_content": "has both the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use.\n\nLease payments are typically fixed and payable on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. Lease payments under certain agreements may escalate over the lease term either by a fixed percentage or a fixed dollar amount. Certain leases may provide for variable lease payments in the form of payments based on usage, a percentage of sales from the location under lease, or index-based (e.g., the U.S. Consumer Price Index) adjustments to lease payments. The Company has no leases which contain residual value guarantees provided by the Company as a lessee.\n\nAs described in Note 4, Acquisitions, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions ,  upon  the  close  of  the  South  Central Portfolio sale in 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to leaseback the Cottonwood facility through May 2025. The lease  was  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  ASC  842-40, Sale  and  Leaseback  Transactions ,  as  an  operating  lease  and accordingly, a right-of-use asset and lease liability were established on the lease commencement date and will be amortized through the end of the lease.\n\n## Lease Cost:\n\n|                                                                                    | For the Year Ended December 31,   | For the Year Ended December 31,   | For the Year Ended December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                      | 2021                              | 2020                              | 2019                              |\n| Finance lease cost   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  4                              | $  3                              | $  -

The  fair  value  of  the  assets  was  determined  using  an  income approach  by  applying  a  discounted  cash  flow  methodology  to  the  long-term  budget  for  the  facility.  The  income  approach utilized  estimates  of  after-tax  cash  flows,  which  were  Level  3  fair  value  measurements,  and  included  key  inputs  such  as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nJoliet -The Company recognized an impairment loss of  $213 million in the East segment as a result of changes in the long-term outlook of the Joliet facility prompted by market conditions and an assessment of various alternatives for the longterm operational landscape of the facility including the impact of the CEJA in Illinois, which concluded with the annual budget process.\n\nOther Impairments -  The  Company additionally recorded impairment losses of $16 million and $9 million related to various power plants in the East and West/Service/Other segments, respectively.\n\nThe Company also recorded the following impairment in 2021 based on a specific triggering event that occurred using the same methodology previously discussed:\n\nPJM Asset Impairments During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  the  results  of  the  PJM  Base  Residual  Auction  for  the 2022/2023 delivery year were released leading the Company to announce the near-term retirement of a significant portion of its PJM  coal  generating  assets  in  June  2022.  The  Company  considered  the  decline  in  PJM  capacity  prices  and  the  near-term retirement dates of certain assets to be a trigger for impairment and performed impairment tests on the PJM generating assets and the goodwill associated with Midwest Generation. Impairment losses of $271 million and $35 million were recorded in the East segment on the PJM generating assets and Midwest Generation goodwill, respectively.\n\n## 2020 Impairment Losses\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company completed its annual budget and revised its view of long-term power and fuel prices and the corresponding impact on estimated cash flows associated with its long-lives assets. The Cottonwood facility had estimated cash flows that were lower than its carrying amount and the assets were considered impaired. The fair value of the assets was determined using an income approach by applying a discounted cash flow methodology to the long-term budget for the facility. The income approach utilized estimates of after-tax cash flows, which were Level 3 fair value measurements, and included key inputs such as forecasted power prices, fuel costs, operating and maintenance costs, plant investment capital expenditures and discount rates.\n\nThe Cottonwood facility is being leased through 2025 and the Company recognized an impairment loss of $32 million in 2020  in  the  West/Services/Other  segment  associated  with  the  Company's  long-term  services  agreement  and  related  lease payments, as the carrying amounts of the assets from the contract were higher than the estimated operating cash flow though the remaining lease period.\n\nThe Company also recorded the following impairments in 2020 based on specific triggering events that occurred:\n\nHome Solar  In  the  third  quarter  of  2020,  the  Company  concluded  its  Home  Solar  business  was  held  for  sale  and recorded an impairment loss of $29 million in the West/Services/Other segment to adjust the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities to fair market value based on indicative sale prices.",

        "page_content": "Petra Nova Parish Holdings During the first quarter of 2020, due to the decline in oil prices, NRG determined that the carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. In determining the fair value, the Company utilized an income approach to estimate future project cash flows. The Company recorded an impairment loss of $18 million in the Texas segment, which included the anticipated  drawdown  of  the  $12  million  letter  of  credit  posted  in  September  2019  to  cover  certain  project  debt  reserve requirements.\n\nOther Impairments - For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded  $14 million of impairment losses related to intangible assets in the Texas segment.\n\n## 2019 Impairment Losses\n\nPetra Nova Parish Holdings - During the third quarter of 2019, NRG contributed  $95 million in cash to Petra Nova and posted a $12 million letter of credit to cover certain project debt reserve requirements. The cash portion of the contribution was used by Petra Nova to prepay a significant portion of the project debt. As a result, the previously disclosed guarantee of up to $124 million  related  to  the  project  level  debt  provided  by  NRG  was  canceled  and  the  remaining  project  debt  became  nonrecourse to NRG. In relation to this contribution, the Company evaluated the project for impairment and determined that the carrying amount of the Company's equity method investment exceeded the fair value of the investment and that the decline is considered to be other-than-temporary. In determining the fair value, the Company utilized an income approach and considered project specific assumptions for the estimated future project cash flows. The Company measured the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the investment and recorded an impairment loss of $101 million.\n\nOther Impairments - For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded  $12 million of impairment losses primarily related to investments and intangibles.\n\n## Note 12 Goodwill and Other Intangibles\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe  table  below  presents  the  changes  of  goodwill  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  based  on  the  Company's reportable segments.

As  of  December 31, 2021 and 2020, the value of emission allowances held-for-sale was $15 million and $14 million, respectively, within the Corporate segment.

        "page_content": "## Senior Notes\n\n## Issuance of 2032 Senior Notes\n\nOn August 23, 2021, the Company issued $1.1 billion of aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2032. The 2032 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NRG and are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries. Interest is paid semi-annually beginning on February 15, 2022 until the maturity date of February 15, 2032. The 2032 Senior Notes were issued under NRG's Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2032 Senior Notes from and including August 15, 2026. The proceeds of the 2032 Senior Notes, along with cash on hand, were used to fund the redemption of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 7.250% Senior Notes due 2026 and $355 million aggregate principal amounts of the 6.625% Senior Notes due 2027.\n\n## Issuance of 2029 Senior Unsecured Notes and 2031 Senior Unsecured Notes\n\nOn December 2, 2020, NRG issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.375% senior notes due 2029 (the '2029 Unsecured Notes') and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.625% senior notes due 2031 (the '2031 Unsecured Notes' and, together with the 2029 Unsecured Notes, the 'Unsecured Notes'). Interest is payable on the Unsecured Notes on February 15  and  August  15  of  each  year  beginning  on  August  15,  2021  until  the  maturity  date  of  February  15,  2029  for  the  2029 Unsecured Notes and February 15, 2031 for the 2031 Unsecured Notes.\n\n## Issuance of 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes\n\nOn December 2, 2020, NRG issued $1.4 billion of aggregate principal amount of senior secured first lien notes, consisting of $500 million 2.000% senior secured first lien notes due 2025 (the '2025 Secured Notes') and $900 million 2.450% senior secured first lien notes due 2027 (the '2027 Secured Notes' and, together with the 2025 Secured Notes, the '2025 and 2027 Senior  Secured  First  Lien  Notes'),  at  a  discount.  The  2027  Secured  Notes  were  issued  under  NRG's  Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework, which sets out certain sustainability targets, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to meet such sustainability targets will result in a 25 basis point increase to the interest rate payable on the 2027 Secured Notes from and including the interest period ending on June 2, 2026. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are guaranteed on a first-priority basis by each of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRG's credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors. The collateral securing the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes will be released if the Company obtains an investment grade rating from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to an obligation to reinstate the collateral if such rating agencies withdraw the Company's investment grade rating or downgrade its rating below investment grade. Interest is payable on the 2025 and 2027 Senior Secured First Lien Notes on June 2 and December 2 of each year beginning on June 2, 2021 until the maturity date of December 2, 2025 for the 2025 Secured Notes and December 2, 2027 for the 2027 Secured Notes.\n\n## Senior Note Redemptions\n\nDuring  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company  redeemed  approximately  $1.9  billion  in  aggregate  principal amount of its Senior Notes for $1.9 billion using the proceeds of the 2032 Senior Notes and cash on hand, as detailed in the table below. In connection with the redemptions, a $77 million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded, which included the write-off of previously deferred financing costs of $12 million.\n\n| (In millions, except percentages)   | Principal Repurchased   | Cash Paid (a)   | Average Early Redemption  Percentage   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 7.250% Senior Notes, due 2026       | 1,000                   | $  1,056        | 103.625 %                              |\n| 6.625% Senior Notes, due 2027       | 855                     | 893             | 103.313 %                              |\n| Total                               | 1,855                   | $  1,949        |                                        |\n\n(a) Includes accrued interest of $29 million for redemptions for the year ended December 31, 2021\n\n## 2048 Convertible Senior Notes\n\nThe  Convertible  Senior  Notes  are  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  ASC  470-20, Debt  with  Conversion  and  Other Options .  Under ASC 470-20, issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion, including partial cash settlement, are required to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components. Prior to February 22, 2022, the Convertible Senior Notes were convertible, under certain circumstances, into the Company's common stock, cash or a combination thereof (at NRG's option) at a price of $44.89 per common share as of December 31, 2021, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 22.2761 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount",

        "page_content": "of  Convertible  Senior  Notes.  On  February  22,  2022,  the  Company  irrevocably  elected  to  eliminate  the  right  to  settle conversions only in shares of the Company's common stock, such that any conversion after such date will be settled in cash or a combination  of  cash  and  the  Company's  common  stock.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  the  Convertible  Senior  Notes  were convertible at a price of $46.24 per common share, which is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately 21.6242 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes. The carrying amounts of the liability components as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $518 million and $503 million, respectively, were calculated by estimating the fair value of similar liabilities without a conversion feature at inception and amortizing the debt discount using the effective interest rate over the life of the note.\n\n## Senior Notes Early Redemption\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, NRG had the following outstanding issuances of senior notes with an early redemption feature, or Senior Notes:\n\n- i. 6.625% senior notes, issued August 2, 2016 and due January 15, 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes;\n- ii. 5.750% senior notes, issued December 7, 2017 and due January 15, 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes;\n- iii. 5.250% senior notes, issued May 24, 2019 and due June 15, 2029, or the 2029 Senior Notes;\n- iv. 3.375% senior notes, issued December 2, 2020 and due February 15, 2029, or the 3.375% 2029 Senior Notes;\n- v. 3.625% senior notes, issued December 2, 2020 and due February 15, 2031, or the 2031 Senior Notes; and\n- vi. 3.875% senior notes, issued August 23, 2021 and due February 15, 2032, or the 2032 Senior Notes.\n\nThe Company periodically enters into supplemental indentures for the purpose of adding entities under the Senior Notes as guarantors.\n\nThe  indentures  and  the  forms  of  notes  provide,  among  other  things,  that  the  Senior  Notes  will  be  senior  unsecured obligations of NRG. The indentures also provide for customary events of default, which include, among others: nonpayment of principal  or  interest;  breach  of  other  agreements  in  the  indentures;  defaults  in  failure  to  pay  certain  other  indebtedness;  the rendering of judgments to pay certain amounts of money against NRG and its subsidiaries; the failure of certain guarantees to be  enforceable;  and  certain  events  of  bankruptcy  or  insolvency.  Generally,  if  an  event  of  default  occurs,  the  Trustee  or  the Holders of at least 25% or 30% (depending on the series of Senior Notes) in principal amount of the then outstanding series of Senior Notes may declare all of the Senior Notes of such series to be due and payable immediately. The terms of the indentures, among other things, limit NRG's ability and certain of its subsidiaries' ability to return capital to stockholders, grant liens on assets to lenders and incur additional debt.

Under the Receivables Facility, certain indirect subsidiaries of the Company sell  their  accounts  receivables to NRG Receivables LLC, subject to certain terms and conditions. In turn, NRG Receivables LLC grants a security interest in the purchased receivables to the Lenders as collateral for cash borrowings and issuances of letters of credit. Pursuant to the Performance Guaranty, the Company has guaranteed, for the benefit of NRG Receivables and the  Lenders,  the  payment  and  performance  by  each  indirect  subsidiary  of  its  respective  obligations  under  the  Receivables Facility. The accounts receivables remain on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any amounts funded by the Lenders to NRG Receivables LLC will be reflected as short-term borrowings. Cash flows from the Receivables Facility are reflected as financing activities in the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company will continue to service the accounts receivables sold in exchange for a servicing fee.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, NRG Receivables LLC entered into the First Amendment to the Receivables Facility with a group of conduit lenders and banks and Royal Bank of Canada, as Administrative Agent to, among other things, (i) increase the existing revolving commitments by $50 million to an aggregate amount of $800 million, (ii) extend the maturity date until July 26, 2022, (iii) make certain adjustments to the pool of receivables through the Receivables Facility and certain related covenants and (iv) provide for revised language relating to interest determination based on SOFR in case of a LIBOR cessation or the occurrence of certain other trigger events. Borrowings by NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility bear interest as defined under the Receivables Financing Agreement. The weighted average interest rate related to usage under the Receivables Facility as of December 31, 2021 was 0.646%. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were $400 million in letters of credit issued under the Receivables Facility.\n\n## Repurchase Facility\n\nOn September 22, 2020, the Company entered into the Repurchase Facility related to the Receivables Facility. Under the Repurchase  Facility,  the  Company  can  borrow  up  to  $75  million,  collateralized  by  a  subordinated  note  issued  by  NRG Receivables LLC to NRG Retail LLC in favor of the originating entities representing a portion of the balance of receivables sold to NRG Receivables LLC under the Receivables Facility.\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company renewed its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date to July 26, 2022 and (ii) provide for revised language relating to interest determination based on SOFR in case of a LIBOR cessation or the occurrence of certain other trigger events. On February 9, 2022, the Company entered into amendments to its existing Repurchase Facility to, among other things, (i) increase the size of the facility from $75 million to $150 million and (ii) replace LIBOR with term SOFR as the benchmark for the pricing rate. The Repurchase Facility has no commitment fee and borrowings  will  be  drawn  at  SOFR  +  1.30%.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  there  were  no  outstanding  borrowings  under  the Repurchase Facility.\n\n## Senior Credit Facility\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility Modification\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company amended its existing credit agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the existing revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of $802 million, and (ii) provide for a new tranche of revolving commitments in  an  aggregate  amount  of  $273  million  with  a  maturity  date  of  July  5,  2023.  The  maturity  date  of  the  new revolving tranche of commitments may, upon request by the Company, and at the option of each applicable lender under the",

Other than with respect to the maturity date, the terms of all revolving commitments and loans made pursuant thereto are identical. The increase in the existing commitments, and the commitments with respect to the new tranche were effective on August 20, 2020 and became available on January 5, 2021 upon the closing of the Direct Energy Acquisition. As of December 31, 2021, total revolving commitments available, subject to usage, under the amended credit agreement was $3.7 billion.\n\n## Credit Default Swap Facility\n\nOn January 4, 2019, the Company entered into an $80 million credit agreement to issue letters of credit, which is currently supporting the Cottonwood facility lease. Annual fees of 1.33% on the facility were paid quarterly in advance. On August 13, 2020, the agreement was amended permitting the Company to increase the size of the facility and fees on the facility were adjusted  to  reflect  the  costs  of  the  credit  default  swaps  that  serve  as  collateral  for  the  facility.  In  order  to  increase  the Company's collective collateral facilities in connection with the Direct Energy acquisition, NRG expanded the facility allowing for  the  issuance  of  an  additional  $150  million  of  letters  of  credit  as  of  December  31,  2020.  As  of  December  31,  2021, $222 million was issued under this facility.\n\n## Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities\n\nIn December 2020 the Company entered into a series of Bilateral Letter of Credit Facilities to allow for the issuance of up to $475 million of letters of credit. These facilities are uncommitted. As of December 31, 2021, $469 million was issued under these facilities.\n\n## Put Option Agreement for Senior Debt Issuance\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company entered into a 3-year put option agreement with a Delaware trust formed by the Company upon completion of the sale of $900 million pre-capitalized trust securities redeemable November 15, 2023 (the 'P-Caps'). The Trust invested the proceeds from the sale of the P-Caps in a portfolio of principal and interest strips of U.S. Treasury securities (the 'Eligible Treasury Assets'). Under the put option agreement, NRG has the right, from time to time, to issue  to  the  Trust  and  to  require  the  Trust  to  purchase  from  NRG,  on  one  or  more  occasions  (the  'Issuance  Right'),  up  to $900 million aggregate principal amount of NRG's 1.841% Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2023 (the 'P-Caps Secured Notes') in exchange for all or a portion of the Eligible Treasury Assets corresponding to the portion of the Issuance Right. NRG will pay a semi-annual premium to the Trust at a rate of 1.65%.\n\nIn connection with the issuance of the P-Caps, on December 11, 2020, NRG entered into an amended and restated facility agreement for the issuance of letters of credit (the 'LC Agreement') with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas as collateral agent (the 'Collateral Agent') and administrative agent pursuant to which certain financial institutions (the 'LC Issuers') have agreed to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $874 million to support the operations of NRG and its subsidiaries  and  minority  investments,  including  to  replace  certain  letters  of  credit  and  other  credit  support  issued  for  the account of entities acquired pursuant to the Direct Energy Acquisition. In addition, on December 11, 2020, the Trust entered into  an  amended  and  restated  pledge  and  control  agreement  (the  'Pledge  Agreement'),  among  NRG,  the  Trust  and  the Collateral Agent for the LC Issuers, under which the Trust agreed to grant a pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the LC Issuers. Pursuant to the LC Agreement and the Pledge Agreement, the Collateral Agent is entitled to withdraw Eligible Treasury Assets from the Trust's pledged account, following notice to NRG, in the event NRG has failed to reimburse amounts drawn under any letter of credit issued pursuant to the LC Agreement, and the LC Issuers have the right to instruct the Collateral Agent to enforce the pledge over the Eligible Treasury Assets upon the occurrence of any event of default under the LC Agreement. The LC Agreement and the Pledge Agreement were available on January 5, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, $873 million of letters of credit were issued under the LC Agreement .\n\n## Tax Exempt Bonds\n\n|                                                                                                              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| (In millions, except rates)                                                                                  | 2021                 | 2020                 | Interest Rate % |\n| NRG Indian River Power 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2040                                                      | $  57                | $  57                | 1.250           |\n| NRG Indian River Power 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2045                                                      | 190                  | 190                  | 1.250           |\n| NRG Dunkirk 2020, tax exempt bonds, due 2042   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                           | 59                   | 59                   | 1.300           |\n| City of Texas City, tax exempt bonds, due 2045   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                       | 33                   | 33                   | 4.125           |\n| Fort Bend County, tax exempt bonds, due 2038  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 54                   | 54                   | 4.750           |\n| Fort Bend County, tax exempt bonds, due 2042  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                        | 73                   | 73                   | 4.750           |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  466               | $  466               |                 |",

The  Dunkirk  Bonds  are  guaranteed  on  a  first-priority  basis  by  each  of NRG's current and future subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under its credit agreement. The Dunkirk Bonds are secured by  a  first  priority  security  interest  in  the  same  collateral  that  is  pledged  for  the  benefit  of  the  lenders  under  NRG's  credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and the guarantors. The collateral securing the Dunkirk Bonds will, at the request of NRG, be released if NRG satisfies certain conditions, including receipt of an investment grade rating on its senior, unsecured debt securities from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if those rating agencies withdraw their investment grade rating of the Dunkirk Bonds or any of NRG's senior, unsecured debt securities or downgrade such rating below investment grade. The Dunkirk Bonds are subject to mandatory tender and purchase on April 3, 2023 and have a final maturity date of April 1, 2042.\n\nNRG used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem during 2020 the existing principal amount of outstanding Dunkirk Power LLC 5.875% tax exempt bonds due 2042.\n\n## Indian River Bonds\n\nOn December 17, 2020, NRG issued $57 million in aggregate principal amount of NRG Indian River 2020 1.25% taxexempt refinancing bonds due 2040 (the \"IR 2040 Bonds\") and $190 million aggregate principal amount of NRG Indian River Power 2020 1.25% tax-exempt refinancing bonds due 2045 (the \"IR 2045 Bonds\") (together the \"IR Bonds\").

The IR Bonds are secured by a first priority security interest in the same collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the lenders under NRG's credit agreement, which consists of a substantial portion of the property and assets owned by NRG and  the  guarantors.  The  collateral  securing  the  IR  Bonds  will,  at  the  request  of  NRG,  be  released  if  NRG  satisfies  certain conditions, including receipt of an investment grade rating on its senior, unsecured debt securities from two out of the three rating agencies, subject to reversion if those rating agencies withdraw their investment grade rating of the IR Bonds or any of NRG's  senior,  unsecured  debt  securities  or  downgrade  such  rating  below  investment  grade.  The  IR  Bonds  are  subject  to mandatory tender and purchase on October 1, 2025 and have final maturity dates of October 1, 2040 for the IR 2040 Bonds and October 1, 2045 for the IR 2045 Bonds.\n\nNRG used the net proceeds from the offering to redeem during 2020 the existing principal amounts of outstanding Indian River Power 6.000% tax exempt bonds due 2040 and Indian River Power LLC 5.375% tax exempt bonds due 2045.\n\n## Note 14 Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nThe  Company's  AROs  are  primarily  related  to  the  environmental  obligations  for  nuclear  decommissioning,  mine reclamation, ash disposal, site closures, fuel storage facilities and future dismantlement of equipment on leased property.

These benefits are based on pay, service history and age at retirement. Most pension benefits are provided through taxqualified plans. NRG also provides postretirement health and welfare benefits for certain groups of employees. Cost sharing provisions vary by the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements.\n\nNRG maintains three separate qualified pension plans, the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees, the NRG Pension Plan and the Pension Plan for Employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (\"DEML\"). Participation in the NRG Pension Plan for Bargained Employees depends upon whether an employee is covered by a bargaining agreement. The NRG Pension plan was frozen for non-union employees on December 31, 2018. The Pension Plan for Employees of DEML is closed to new participants.\n\nDue to updated assumptions as a result of ARPA, NRG does not expect to contribute to the Company's pension plans in 2022.\n\n## NRG Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe annual net periodic benefit cost/(credit) related to NRG's pension and other postretirement benefit plans include the following components:\n\n|                                                                                                                  | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   | Year Ended December 31, Pension Benefits   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                    | 2021                                       | 2020                                       | 2019                                       |\n| Service cost benefits earned   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  9                                       | $  10                                      | $  10                                      |\n| Interest cost on benefit obligation   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | 27                                         | 38                                         | 46                                         |\n| Expected return on plan assets   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | (66)                                       | (61)                                       | (59)                                       |\n| Amortization of unrecognized net loss   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .        | 1                                          | 5                                          | 3                                          |\n| Settlement/curtailment expense  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | 2                                          | -

The fair value of the common/collective trust investments is valued at fair value which is equal to the sum of the market value of all of the fund's underlying investments. Certain common/collective trust investments have readily determinable fair value as they publish daily net asset value, or NAV, per share and are categorized as Level 2. Certain other common/collective trust investments and partnerships/joint ventures use NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient for valuation, and thus have been removed from the fair value hierarchy table.\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit obligations:\n\n|                                                                                | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average Assumptions                                                   | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2021                          | 2020                          |\n| Discount rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 2.89 %               | 2.56 %               | 2.89 %                        | 2.54 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 3.07 %               | 3.12 %               | 1.94 %                        | 1.62 %                        |\n| Rate of compensation increase                                                  | 3.06 %               | 3.00 %               | - %                           | - %                           |\n| Health care trend rate   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     | -                    | -                    | 6.8% grading  to 4.4% in 2028 | 7.2% grading to  4.5% in 2028 |\n\nThe following table presents the significant assumptions used to calculate NRG's benefit expense:\n\n|                                                           | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                           | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| Weighted-Average  Assumptions                             | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2019                 | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2019                          |\n| Discount rate   . . . . . . . .                           | 2.55 %               | 3.26 %               | 4.38%/4.20%          | 2.81%                         | 3.26 %                        | 4.37 %                        |\n| Interest crediting rate  . .                              | 3.13 %               | 3.66 %               | -                    | 1.62 %                        | 2.28 %                        | -                             |\n| Expected return on plan  assets   . . . . . . . . . . . . | 5.62 %               | 5.93 %               | 6.35 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Rate of compensation  increase  . . . . . . . . . . .     | 3.06 %               | 3.00 %               | 3.00 %               | -                             | -                             | -                             |\n| Health care trend rate  . .                               | -                    | -                    | -                    | 7.0% grading  to 4.4% in 2028 | 7.5% grading  to 4.5% in 2028 | 7.8% grading to  4.5% in 2025 |",

The Company sets the discount rate assumptions on an annual basis for each of NRG's defined benefit retirement plans as of December 31. The discount rate assumptions represent the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at December 31. The Company utilizes the Aon AA Above Median, or AA-AM, yield curve and the AON Canada yield curve to select the appropriate discount rate assumption for its retirement plans. The AA-AM yield curve is a hypothetical AA yield curve represented by a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 6 months to 99 years. Under the AA-AM yield curve, each bond issue used to build this yield curve must be non-callable, and have an average rating  of  AA  when  averaging  available  Moody's  Investor  Services,  Standard  &  Poor's  and  Fitch  ratings.  The  AON Canada yield curve is based on high quality corporate bonds. Under the AON Canada yield curve, expected plan cash flows were discounted using the the yield curve, and then a single rate is determined which produces an equivalent present value.\n\nNRG employs a total return investment approach, whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximize  the  long-term  return  of  plan  assets  for  a  prudent  level  of  risk.  Risk  tolerance  is  established  through  careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The Investment Committee reviews the asset  mix  periodically  and  as  the  plan  assets  increase  in  future  years,  the  Investment  Committee  may  examine  other  asset classes such as real estate or private equity. NRG employs a building block approach to determining the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets, with proper consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships between equities and fixed income are preserved, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.\n\nThe target allocations of NRG's pension plan assets were as follows for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n\n| U.S. equity   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 17 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Non-U.S. equity                                                                                                                                                                 | 13 %   |\n| Non-core assets   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .       | 15 %   |\n| Fixed Income   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | 55 %   |\n\nPlan  assets  are  currently  invested  in  a  diversified  blend  of  equity  and  fixed-income  investments.

STPNOC, which operates and maintains STP, provides its employees a defined benefit pension plan, as well as postretirement health and welfare benefits. Although NRG does not sponsor the STP plan, it reimburses STPNOC for 44% of the contributions made towards its retirement plan obligations.\n\nDuring 2019, STPNOC announced that the defined benefit pension plan would be frozen. As a result, during 2019, NRG recognized a gain of $8 million related to the curtailment of benefits and an increase of $32 million to the pension liability was recorded  to  other  comprehensive  income.  The  Company  measures  the  fair  value  of  its  pension  assets  in  accordance  with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or  ASC 820. As of December 31, 2021, the STPNOC defined benefit pension plan was frozen to all employees.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, NRG reimbursed STPNOC $17 million and $8 million, respectively, for its contribution to the plans. In 2022, NRG expects to reimburse STPNOC $13 million for its contribution to the plan.\n\nThe Company has recognized the following in its statement of financial position, statement of operations and accumulated OCI related to its 44% interest in STP:\n\n|                                                                                                              | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,            | As of December 31,            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                              | Pension Benefits     | Pension Benefits     | Other Postretirement Benefits | Other Postretirement Benefits |\n| (In millions)                                                                                                | 2021                 | 2020                 | 2021                          | 2020                          |\n| Funded status - STPNOC benefit plans  . . . . . . . . . .                                                    | $  (50)  $           | (99)  $              | (18)  $                       | (20)                          |\n| Net periodic benefit cost/(credit)   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                         | 17                   | 7                    | (4)                           | (4)                           |\n| Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations  recognized in other comprehensive income   . . . . . . | (51)                 | 22                   | 4                             | 5                             |\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nNRG's employees are also eligible to participate in defined contribution 401(k) plans.\n\nThe Company's contributions to these plans were as follows:\n\n|                                                     |   Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 | Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019   | Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                       |                                2021 |                                     |                                     |\n| Company contributions to defined contribution plans |                                  25 | 22                                  | 22                                  |",

The return of capital to shareholders is expected to be completed through the increased dividend supplemented by share repurchases. The long-term capital allocation policy targets an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9% per share in years subsequent to 2020. In 2021 and 2022, NRG increased the  annual  dividend  to  $1.30  and  $1.40  per  share,  representing  an  8%  increase  each  year.  The  Company's  common  stock dividends  are  subject  to  available  capital,  market  conditions,  and  compliance  with  associated  laws,  regulations  and  other contractual obligations.\n\nOn January 21, 2022, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of $0.35 per share, or $1.40 per share on an annualized basis, payable on February 15, 2022, to stockholders of record as of February 1, 2022.\n\nEmployee  Stock  Purchase  Plan -  In  March  2019,  the  Company  reopened  participation  in  the  ESPP,  which  allows eligible  employees  to  elect  to  withhold  between  1%  and  10%  of  their  eligible  compensation  to  purchase  shares  of  NRG common stock at the lesser of 95% of its market value on the offering date or 95% of the fair market value on the exercise date. An offering date will occur each April 1 and October 1. An exercise date will occur each September 30 and March 31. As of December 31, 2021, there remained 2,636,199 shares of treasury stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP.\n\nShare Repurchases - In 2018, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase  $1.5 billion of its common stock.  The  Company  executed  $1.25  billion  of  these  share  repurchases  in  2018,  with  the  remaining  $0.25  billion completed in the first quarter of 2019. In 2019, the Company's board of directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional $1.25 billion of its common stock. The Company executed $1.194 billion of these share repurchases in 2019 and completed the remaining $56 million under the 2019 authorization by February 27, 2020. The remaining repurchases in 2020 and were made under the long-term capital allocation policy discussed above. On December 6, 2021 the Company announced that the Board of Directors has authorized $1 billion for share repurchases, as part of NRG's Capital Allocation Program. The program began in 2021 and will continue throughout 2022.",

NRG's carrying value of equity investments can be impacted by a number of elements including impairments, unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe following table summarizes NRG's equity method investments as of December 31, 2021:\n\n## (In millions, except percentages)\n\n| Name:                                                                                                                                                                  | Economic Interest                                                                                                                     | Investment  Balance (a)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Gladstone  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 37.5 %                                                                                                                                | $  127                    |\n| Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                | 54.5 %                                                                                                                                | 4                         |\n| Watson Cogeneration Company   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  | 49.0 %                                                                                                                                | 14                        |\n| Midway-Sunset Cogeneration Company                                                                                                                                     | 50.0 %                                                                                                                                | 12                        |\n| Total equity investments in affiliates                                                                                                                                 | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  157                    |\n| Petra Nova Parish Holdings, LLC (b)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                 | 50.0 %                                                                                                                                | $  (16)                   |\n\n|                                                | As of December 31,   | As of December 31,   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (In millions)                                  | 2021                 | 2020                 |\n| Undistributed earnings from equity investments | $  33                | $  30                |\n\n## Variable Interest Entities\n\nNRG accounts for its interests in certain entities that are considered VIEs under ASC 810, Consolidation , for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary, under the equity method.\n\nThrough its consolidated subsidiary, NRG Solar Ivanpah LLC, NRG owns a 54.5% interest in Ivanpah Master Holdings, LLC, or Ivanpah, the owner of three solar electric generating projects located in the Mojave Desert with a total capacity of 393 MW. NRG considers this investment a VIE under ASC 810 and NRG is not considered the primary beneficiary. The Company accounts for its interest under the equity method of accounting.\n\n## Other Equity Investments\n\nGladstone -  Through  a  joint  venture,  NRG  owns  a 37.5%  interest  in  Gladstone,  a  1,613  MW  coal-fueled  power generation facility in Queensland, Australia. The power generation facility is managed by the joint venture participants and the facility is operated by NRG. Operating expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the facility are funded by each of the participants in proportion to their ownership interests. Coal is sourced from local mines in Queensland. NRG and the joint venture  participants  receive  their  respective  share  of  revenues  directly  from  the  off  takers  in  proportion  to  the  ownership interests in the joint venture. Power generated by the facility is primarily sold to an adjacent aluminum smelter, with excess power sold to the Queensland Government-owned utility under long-term supply contracts. NRG's investment in Gladstone was $127 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Entities that are Consolidated\n\nThe Company has a controlling financial interest that has been identified as a VIE under ASC 810 in NRG Receivables LLC, which has entered into financing transactions related to the Receivables Facility as further described in Note 13, Longterm Debt and Finance Leases.",

Shares issued and treasury shares repurchased during the year are weighted for the portion of the year that they were outstanding. Diluted income per share is computed in a manner consistent with that of basic income per share, while giving effect to all potentially dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.\n\nDilutive effect for equity compensation and other equity instruments - The outstanding relative performance stock units, non-vested  restricted  stock  units,  market  stock  units  and  non-qualified  stock  options  are  not  considered  outstanding  for purposes of computing basic income per share. However, these instruments are included in the denominator for purposes of computing  diluted  income  per  share  under  the  treasury  stock  method.  As  of  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  the Convertible  Senior  Notes  were  convertible,  under  certain  circumstances,  into  the  Company's  common  stock,  cash  or combination thereof (at NRG's option). There was no dilutive effect for the Convertible Senior Notes due to the Company's expectation, as of such dates, to settle the liability in cash. On February 22, 2022, the Company irrevocably elected to eliminate the right to settle conversions only in shares of the Company's common stock, such that any conversion after such date will be settled in cash or a combination of cash and the Company's common stock.\n\nThe reconciliation of NRG's basic income per share to diluted income per share is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions, except per share amounts)                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Basic income per share attributable to NRG Energy, Inc;                                                                                                                                                                           |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. common stockholders  . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                                              | $  2,187                  | $  510                    | $  4,438                  |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-basic   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                              | 245                       | 245                       | 262                       |\n| Income per weighted average common share - basic  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                           | $  8.93                   | $  2.08                   | $  16.94                  |\n| Diluted income per share attributable to NRG Energy, Inc;                                                                                                                                                                         |                           |                           |                           |\n| Net income attributable to NRG Energy, Inc. common stockholders  . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                                              | $  2,187                  | $  510                    | $  4,438                  |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-basic   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                              | 245                       | 245                       | 262                       |\n| Incremental shares attributable to the issuance of equity compensation (treasury stock  method)   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | -                         | 1                         | 2                         |\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding-diluted  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                               | 245                       | 246                       | 264                       |\n| Income per weighted average common share - diluted  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                                                                                                                             | $  8.93                   | $  2.07                   | $  16.81                  |\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company had an insignificant number of outstanding equity instruments that are anti-dilutive and were not included in the computation of the Company's diluted income per share.\n\n## Note 19 Segment Reporting\n\nThe  Company's  segment  structure  reflects  how  management  makes  financial  decisions  and  allocates  resources.

In making the determination to release the majority of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2019, the Company evaluated a number of factors, including its recent history of pre-tax earnings, utilization of $593 million of NOLs in 2019, as well as its forecasted future pre-tax earnings. Based on this evaluation, the Company determined that the majority of its future tax benefits are morelikely-than-not to be realized. Given the Company's current level of pre-tax earnings and forecasted future pre-tax earnings, the Company expects to generate income before taxes in the U.S. in future periods at a level that would fully utilize its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and the majority of its state NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Senate passed the CARES Act to provide emergency relief related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act contains federal income tax provisions which, among other things: (i) increases the amount of interest expense that businesses are allowed to deduct by increasing the adjusted taxable income limitation from 30% to 50% for tax years that begin  in  2019  and  2020;  (ii)  permits  businesses  to  carry  back  to  each  of  the  five  tax  years  NOLs  arising  from  tax  years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2020; and (iii) temporarily removes the 80% limitation on NOLs until tax years beginning after 2020. The CARES Act provisions did not have a material impact on the tax positions of the Company.\n\nThe following represented the domestic and foreign components of income from continuing operations before income taxes:\n\n|                                                                                                                   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                                     | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| U.S.    . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  2,759                  | $  749                    | $  771                    |\n| Foreign   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | 100                       | 12                        | 15                        |\n| Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    | $  2,859                  | $  761                    | $  786                    |",

 As  of December  31,  2021  and  2020,  NRG  recorded  a  net  deferred  tax  asset,  excluding valuation allowance, of $2.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not be realizable under the more-likely-than-not measurement and as such, a valuation allowance was recorded as of December 31, 2021 as discussed below.\n\nNOL carryforwards -  As  of December 31, 2021, the Company had tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $1.8 billion and $328 million, respectively. The Company estimates it will need to generate future taxable income to fully realize the net federal deferred tax asset before the expiration of certain carryforwards commences in 2031. In addition, NRG has tax-effected cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of $112 million with no expiration date.",

        "page_content": "Valuation allowance -  As of December 31, 2021, the Company's tax-effected valuation allowance was $248 million, consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards. The valuation allowance was recorded based on the assessment  of  cumulative  and  forecasted  pre-tax  book  earnings  and  the  future  reversal  of  existing  taxable  temporary differences.\n\n## Taxes Receivable and Payable\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, NRG recorded a current net federal receivable of $16 million, comprised of refunds due from the IRS, a current net state tax payable of $13 million that is primarily comprised of Texas margin tax, and a current net foreign receivable of $11 million due to filings of Canadian amended returns as well as prepayments of estimated taxes.\n\n## Uncertain tax benefits\n\nNRG has identified uncertain tax benefits with after-tax value of $13 million and $15 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, for which NRG has recorded a non-current tax liability of $14 million and $18 million, respectively. The Company recognizes  interest  and  penalties  related  to  uncertain  tax  benefits  in  income  tax  expense.

The weighted average grant date fair value of DSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $32.27, $35.59 and $34.84, respectively.\n\n## Performance Stock Units\n\nPSUs entitle the recipient to stock upon vesting. The amount of the award is subject to the Company's achievement of certain performance measures over the vesting period. PSUs include RPSUs and MSUs. As of December 31, 2021, non-vested PSUs consist of RPSUs.\n\nRelative Performance Stock Units RPSUs are restricted grants where the quantity of shares increases and decreases alongside the Company's Total Shareholder Return, or TSR, relative to the TSR of the Company's current proxy peer group and the total returns of select indexes, or Peer Group (a) . Each RPSU represents the potential to receive NRG common stock after the completion of the performance period, typically three years of service from the date of grant. The number of shares of NRG common stock to be paid (if any) as of the vesting date for each RPSU will depend on the Company's percentile rank within the Peer Group. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each RPSU is linearly interpolated for TSR performance between the following points: (i)  0%  if  ranked  below  the  25th  percentile;  (ii)  25%  if  ranked  at  the  25th percentile; (iii) 100% if ranked at the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if the Company's absolute TSR is less than negative 15%); and (iv) 200% if ranked at the 75th percentile or above. The value of the common stock on the date of grant is based on the closing price of NRG common stock on the date of grant.\n\n(a) For RPSU's granted in 2022 and forward the peer group will consist of the companies that comprise the Standard & Poor's 500 Index on the first day of the performance period.",

These contracts are not included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

NRG uses the first lien structure to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedges. To the extent  that  the  underlying  hedge  positions  for  a  counterparty  are  out-of-the-money  to  NRG,  the  counterparty  would  have  a claim under the first lien program. As of December 31, 2021, hedges under the first lien were out-of-the-money for NRG on a counterparty aggregate basis.\n\n## Nuclear Insurance\n\nSTP  maintains  required  insurance  coverage  for  liability  claims  arising  from  nuclear  incidents  pursuant  to  the  PriceAnderson Act. The current liability limit per incident is $13.8 billion, subject to change to account for the effects of inflation and  the  number  of  licensed  reactors.  An  inflation  adjustment  must  be  made  at  least  once  every  five  years  with  the  next adjustment expected to be effective no later than November 1, 2023. Under the Price-Anderson Act, owners of nuclear power plants in the U.S. are required to purchase primary insurance limits of $450 million for each operating site. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act requires an additional layer of protection through mandatory participation in a retrospective rating plan for power  reactors  resulting  in  an  additional  $13.3  billion  in  funds  available  for  public  liability  claims.  The  current  maximum assessment per incident, per reactor, is approximately $138 million, taking into account a 5% adjustment for administrative fees,  payable  at  approximately  $21  million  per  year,  per  reactor.  NRG  would  be  responsible  for  44%  of  the  maximum assessment, or $9 million per year, per reactor, and a maximum of $61 million per incident, per reactor. In addition, the U.S. Congress  retains  the  ability  to  impose  additional  financial  requirements  on  the  nuclear  industry  to  pay  liability  claims  that exceed $13.8 billion for a single incident. The liabilities of the co-owners of STP with respect to the retrospective premium assessments for nuclear liability insurance are joint and several.\n\nSTP purchases insurance for property damage and site decontamination cleanup costs from Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited, or NEIL, and European Mutual Association for Nuclear Insurance, or EMANI, both of which are industry mutual insurance companies, of which STP is a member. STP has purchased $2.8 billion in limits for nuclear events and $1.0 billion in limits for non-nuclear events. The nuclear event limit remains the maximum available from NEIL. The upper $1.3 billion in nuclear events limits (excess of the first $1.5 billion in nuclear events limits) is a single limit blanket policy shared with two Diablo Canyon nuclear reactors, which have no affiliation with the Company. This shared limit is not subject to automatic reinstatement in the event of a loss. The NEIL primary policy covers both nuclear and non-nuclear property damage events, and a NEIL companion policy provides Accidental Outage coverage for the co-owners of STP's lost revenue following a property damage event, at a weekly indemnity limit of $3 million per unit up to a maximum of $274 million nuclear per unit and $184 million non-nuclear per unit, and is subject to an eight-week waiting period. NRG also purchases an Accidental Outage policy from NEIL, which provides protection for lost revenue due to an insurable event. This coverage allows for reimbursement up to $2 million per week per unit up to a maximum of $216 million nuclear and $144 million non-nuclear, and is subject to an eight-",

        "page_content": "week waiting period. Accidental Outage coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. Under the terms of the NEIL and EMANI policies, member companies may be assessed up to ten and six times their annual premiums respectively if the NEIL or EMANI Board of Directors determines their surplus has been depleted due to the payment of property losses at any of the licensed reactors in a single policy year. NEIL and EMANI require that their members maintain an investment grade credit rating or ensure their annual retrospective obligation by providing a financial  guarantee,  letter  of  credit,  deposit  premium,  or  an  insurance  policy.  NRG  has  purchased  an  insurance  policy  from NEIL and EMANI to guarantee the Company's obligation; however note the NEIL aspect of this insurance will only respond to retrospective  premium  adjustments  assessed  within  twenty-four  months  after  the  policy  term,  whereas  NEIL's  Board  of Directors can make such an adjustment up to 6 years after the policy expires. All insurance coverage is subject to various sub limits and significant deductibles.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nThe Company's material legal proceedings are described below. The Company believes that it has valid defenses to these legal proceedings and intends to defend them vigorously. NRG records accruals for estimated losses from contingencies when information available indicates that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. As  applicable,  the  Company  has  established  an  adequate  accrual  for  the  applicable  legal  matters,  including  regulatory  and environmental matters as further discussed in Note 24, Regulatory Matters , and Note 25, Environmental Matters . In addition, legal costs are expensed as incurred. Management has assessed each of the following matters based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, considering the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought, and the probability of success. Unless specified below, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these legal proceedings  or  reasonably  estimate  the  scope  or  amount  of  any  associated  costs  and  potential  liabilities.  As  additional information becomes available, management adjusts its assessment and estimates of such contingencies accordingly. Because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the Company's liabilities and contingencies could be at amounts that are different from its currently recorded accruals and that such difference could be material.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  party  to  other  litigation  or  legal proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business.  In  management's  opinion,  the  disposition  of  these  ordinary  course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\n## Environmental Lawsuits\n\nSierra club et al. v. Midwest Generation LLC - In 2012, several environmental groups filed a complaint against Midwest Generation  with  the  Illinois  Pollution  Control  Board  (\"IPCB\")  alleging  violations  of  environmental  law  resulting  in groundwater contamination. In June 2019, the IPCB found that Midwest Generation violated the law because it had improperly handled coal ash at four facilities in Illinois and caused or allowed coal ash constituents to impact groundwater. On September 9, 2019, Midwest Generation filed a Motion to Reconsider numerous issues, which the court granted in part and denied in part on February 6, 2020. The IPCB will hold hearings to determine the appropriate relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010.\n\n## Consumer Lawsuits\n\nSimilar to other energy service companies ('ESCOs') operating in the industry, from time-to-time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be subject to consumer lawsuits in various jurisdictions where they sell natural gas and electricity.\n\nVariable  Price  Cases  In  the  cases  set  forth  below,  referred  to  as  the  Variable  Price  Cases,  such  actions  involve consumers alleging that one of the Company's ESCOs promised that consumers would pay the same or less than they would have paid if they stayed with their default utility or previous energy supplier. The underlying claims of each case are similar and the  Company  continues  to  deny  the  allegations  and  is  vigorously  defending  these  matters.  These  matters  were  known  and accrued for at the time of each acquisition.\n\n## XOOM Energy\n\nXOOM Energy is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit pending in New York. This case is in the discovery phase.\n\n## Direct Energy\n\nThere are three putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Linda Stanley v. Direct Energy (S.D.N.Y Apr. 2019)  -  The  parties  mediated  in  June  and  agreed  on  a  settlement.  On  November  16,  2021,  the  Court  granted  preliminary approval of the settlement. The final approval hearing will be held on April 5, 2022. It may take several months to determine the final payout amount; (2) Martin Forte v. Direct Energy (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 2017) - The Court recently granted Direct Energy's Motion for Summary Judgment effectively ending the matter at the district court level. It is likely that the plaintiff will appeal;",

        "page_content": "however, it is unlikely plaintiff will prevail; (3) Richard Schafer v. Direct Energy (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 2019; on appeal 2nd Cir. N.Y.) - The Court granted limited discovery that will end April 29, 2022. Summary judgement briefing is due on May 20, 2022.\n\nTelephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\") Cases - In the cases set forth below, referred to as the TCPA Cases, such actions involve consumers alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended, by receiving calls,  texts  or  voicemails  without  consent  in  violation  of  the  federal  Telemarketing  Sales  Rule,  and/or  state  counterpart legislation.  The  underlying  claims  of  each  case  are  similar.  The  Company  denies  the  allegations  asserted  by  plaintiffs  and intends to vigorously defend these matters. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThere are two putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Brittany Burk v. Direct Energy (S.D. Tex. Feb. 2019) - The Court denied Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification and Motion for Substitution of a New Plaintiff on September 20,  2021.  The parties reached a settlement of the plaintiff's individual claims and the Court has conditionally dismissed the matter;  and  (2)  Matthew  Dickson  v.  Direct  Energy  (N.D.  Ohio  Jan.  2018)  -  Direct  Energy  has  filed  a  Third-Party  Petition against its vendor, Total Marketing Concepts, LLC, who placed voicemails without consent from Direct Energy and in violation of  the  parties'  agreement.  The  case  was  stayed  pending  the  outcome  of  an  appeal  to  the  Sixth  Circuit  based  on  the unconstitutionality of the TCPA during the period from 2015-2020. The Sixth Circuit found the TCPA was in effect during that period and remanded the case back to the trial court. Direct Energy refiled its motions along with supplements.\n\n## Winter Storm Uri Lawsuits\n\nThe Company has been named in certain property damage and wrongful death claims that have been filed in connection with Winter Storm Uri. At this time, the Company is unable to determine the extent or impact of these various litigation matters due to their preliminary nature. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.\n\n## Indemnifications and Other Contractual Arrangements\n\nWashington-St. Tammany and Claiborne Electric Cooperative v. LaGen On June 28, 2017, plaintiffs Washington-St. Tammany Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Claiborne Electric Cooperative, Inc. filed a lawsuit against LaGen in the United States District  Court  for  the  Middle  District  of  Louisiana.  The  plaintiffs  claimed  breach  of  contract  against  LaGen  for  allegedly improperly charging the plaintiffs for costs related to the installation and maintenance of certain pollution control technology. Plaintiffs  sought  damages  for  the  alleged  improper  charges  and  a  declaration  as  to  which  charges  were  proper  under  the contract. In February 2020, the court dismissed this lawsuit without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On March 17, 2020, plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge in Louisiana alleging substantially the same matters. The Company anticipates a trial, in state court, to begin in 2023. On February 4, 2019, NRG sold the South Central Portfolio, including the entities subject to this litigation. However, NRG has agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain losses suffered in connection therewith.\n\n## Note 24 Regulatory Matters\n\nNRG operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. As such, NRG is affected by regulatory developments at both the federal and state levels and in the regions in which NRG operates. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures, and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which NRG participates. These power markets are subject to ongoing legislative and regulatory changes that may impact NRG's wholesale and retail operations.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  regulatory  proceedings  noted  below,  NRG  and  its  subsidiaries  are  parties  to  other  regulatory proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  or  have  other  regulatory  exposure.  In  management's  opinion,  the disposition of these ordinary course matters will not materially adversely affect NRG's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\nCalifornia  Station  Power  As  the  result  of  unfavorable  final  and  non-appealable  litigation,  the  Company  accrued  a liability associated with consumption of station power at the Company's Encina power plant facility in California after August 30, 2010. The Company has established an appropriate accrual pending potential regulatory action by San Diego Gas & Electric regarding the Company's Encina facility.\n\nSouth Central On August 4, 2016, NRG received a document hold notice from FERC regarding conduct in the MISO and PJM markets. FERC Office of Enforcement Staff investigated potential violations of MISO rules involving bidding for the Big Cajun 2 facility, as well as other aspects of NRG's operations in MISO. On August 18, 2020, FERC Office of Enforcement presented NRG with its preliminary findings. NRG responded to the preliminary findings on January 15, 2021. On September 16, 2021, FERC Office of Enforcement Staff informed NRG that the investigation is closed with no further action.",

        "page_content": "## Note 25 Environmental Matters\n\nNRG is subject  to  a  wide  range  of  environmental  laws  in  the  development,  construction,  ownership  and  operation  of power  plants.  These  laws  generally  require  that  governmental  permits  and  approvals  be  obtained  before  construction  and maintained  during  operation  of  power  plants.  The  electric  generation  industry  has  been  facing  increasingly  stringent requirements  regarding  air  quality,  GHG  emissions,  combustion  byproducts,  water  discharge  and  use,  and  threatened  and endangered species. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position,  results  of  operations,  or  cash  flows.  The  Company  has  elected  to  use  a $1 million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party.\n\n## Air\n\nOn July 8, 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO2 emissions from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit's decision, which should provide some clarity regarding the scope of the EPA's authority to regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. The Company expects the EPA to promulgate a new rule to regulate GHG emissions from power plants after a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n## Water\n\nEffluent Limitations Guidelines - In November 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. On July 26, 2021, the EPA announced that it is initiating a new rulemaking to evaluate revising the ELG rule. While the EPA is developing the new rule, the existing rule (as amended in 2020) will stay in place, and the  EPA  expects  permitting  authorities  to  continue  to  implement  the  current  regulation.  The  EPA  anticipates  releasing  a proposed rule in fall 2022. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants in Texas.\n\n## Byproducts, Wastes, Hazardous Materials and Contamination\n\nIn April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. In September 2017, the EPA agreed to reconsider the rule. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the existing ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy ponds. In 2019 and 2020, the EPA proposed several changes to this rule. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Close Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure,\" which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized \"A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B,\" which  further  amended  the  April  2015  Rule  to,  among  other  things,  provide  procedures  for  requesting  approval  to  operate existing impoundments with an alternative liner.\n\n## Note 26 Cash Flow Information\n\nDetail of supplemental disclosures of cash flow and non-cash investing and financing information was:\n\n|                                                                                                             | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                                                               | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Interest paid, net of amount capitalized  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   | $  433                    | $  340                    | $  372                    |\n| Income taxes paid, net of refunds   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | 32                        | 24                        | 8                         |\n| Non-cash investing activities:                                                                              |                           |                           |                           |\n| (Decreases)/additions to fixed assets for accrued capital expenditures                                      | (16)                      | (6)                       | 1                         |",

        "page_content": "## Note 27 Guarantees\n\nNRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnification and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company's business activities. Examples of these contracts include asset purchases and sale agreements, commodity sale  and  purchase  agreements,  retail  contracts,  joint  venture  agreements,  EPC  agreements,  operation  and  maintenance agreements, service agreements, settlement agreements, and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties, as well as affiliates. These contracts generally indemnify the counterparty for tax, environmental liability, litigation and other matters, as well as breaches of representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements. The Company is obligated with respect to customer deposits associated with the Company's retail operations. In some cases, NRG's maximum potential liability cannot be estimated, since the underlying agreements contain no limits on potential liability.\n\nThe  following  table  summarizes  the  maximum  potential  exposures  that  can  be  estimated  for  NRG's  guarantees, indemnities, and other contingent liabilities by maturity:\n\n|                                                                   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   | By Remaining Maturity at December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| (In millions)                                                     | 2021                                    | 2021                                    | 2021                                    | 2021                                    | 2021                                    |                                         |\n| Guarantees                                                        | Under 1 Year                            | 1-3 Years                               | 3-5 Years                               | Over 5 Years                            | Total                                   | 2020 Total                              |\n| Letters of credit and surety bonds                                | $  4,064                                | $  31                                   | $  -                                    | $  -                                    | $  4,095                                | $  1,153                                |\n| Asset sales guarantee obligations   . . . . . . . . . .           | 269                                     | 25                                      | 24                                      | 96                                      | 414                                     | 506                                     |\n| Other guarantees   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  | -                                       | -                                       | -                                       | 93                                      | 93                                      | 87                                      |\n| Total guarantees  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | $  4,333                                | $  56                                   | $  24                                   | $  189                                  | $  4,602                                | $  1,746                                |\n\nLetters of credit and surety bonds - As of  December 31, 2021, NRG and its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently obligated for a total of $4.1 billion under letters of credit and surety bonds. The significant increase in 2021 is primarily due to the  acquisition  of  Direct  Energy.  Most  of  these  letters  of  credit  and  surety  bonds  are  issued  in  support  of  the  Company's obligations  to  perform  under  commodity  agreements  and  obligations  associated  with  future  closure  and  maintenance  of  ash sites, as well as for financing or other arrangements. A majority of these letters of credit and surety bonds expire within one year of issuance, and it is typical for the Company to renew them on similar terms.\n\nThe material indemnities, within the scope of ASC 460, are as follows:\n\nAsset  sales -  The  purchase  and  sale  agreements  which  govern  NRG's  asset  or  share  investments  and  divestitures customarily contain guarantees and indemnifications of the transaction to third parties. The contracts indemnify the parties for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party, or as a result of a change in tax laws. These obligations generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or estimate at the time of the transaction. In several cases, the contract limits the liability of the indemnifier. NRG has no reason to believe that the Company currently has any material liability relating to such routine indemnification obligations included in the table above, except for the California property tax indemnity for estimated increases in California property taxes of certain solar properties that the Company agreed to indemnify NRG Yield for, as part of the agreement to sell NRG Yield and the Renewables Platform. The California property tax indemnity is estimated to be $158 million as of December 31, 2021 and is included in the above table under asset sales guarantee obligations.\n\nOther guarantees - NRG has issued other guarantees of obligations including payments under certain agreements with respect to certain of its unconsolidated subsidiaries, payment or performance by fuel providers and payment or reimbursement of credit support and deposits. The Company does not believe that it will be required to perform under these guarantees.\n\nOther  indemnities -  Other  indemnifications  NRG  has  provided  cover  operational,  tax,  litigation  and  breaches  of representations, warranties and covenants. NRG has also indemnified, on a routine basis in the ordinary course of business, consultants or other vendors who have provided services to the Company. NRG's maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications  can  range  from  a  specified  dollar  amount  to  an  indeterminate  amount,  depending  on  the  nature  of  the transaction. Total maximum potential exposure under these indemnifications is not estimable due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved. NRG does not have any reason to believe that the Company will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\n\nBecause many of the guarantees and indemnities NRG issues to third parties and affiliates do not limit the amount or duration of its obligations to perform under them, there exists a risk that the Company may have obligations in excess of the amounts described above. For those guarantees and indemnities that do not limit the Company's liability exposure, it may not be able to estimate what the Company's liability would be, until a claim is made for payment or performance, due to the contingent nature of these contracts.",
