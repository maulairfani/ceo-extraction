There is no denying that the global pandemic  has  had  a  terrible  impact  on  the world,  in  both  human  and  economic  terms. As a company, we sadly lost some of our own employees and my thoughts go out to the very many people around the world who have been affected in this way. The upheaval created by the crisis has been terrible, but at the same time it has brought new opportunities for those who are able to see and create them. Now, 18 months down the line, I am convinced this crisis has strengthened your Group, and we are even better placed now to face the future.\n\nI would say without a doubt that the main factor enabling a company to get through periods of turbulence is the resilience and engagement of its people. It is thanks to the strength of our inclusive culture and the exceptional commitment of our teams that we were able to gain precious time by reacting quickly and effectively in the face of the storm. Combining the strength of a large group with the agility of a start-up is every CEO's dream, and I cannot praise our people enough as they were once again the determining factor in\n\nthis year's performance. With operating profit internal growth of +18%, we are already above pre-crisis levels (1) . That is why I am proud to announce that in FY22 the Group will launch a new Employee Share Ownership Plan. This will enable our employees to buy Pernod Ricard shares on favourable terms and benefit from the ongoing transformation they are building every day and everywhere to accelerate our Group's future growth.\n\n## 'This crisis has strengthened your Group.'\n\nThe danger now would be to believe that the crisis is already behind us when this is far from being the case. I would argue that hardly matters: the real challenge is to firmly establish this rebound by continuing our transformation. We are determined to remain focused on creating",

This is the true leadership we have been aiming towards since your Group was founded. And it is thanks to support from you, our valued shareholders, that we are in a position to build our future with serenity and confidence in times of crisis.\n\nThe solidity of our foundations was confirmed by the fall-out from the pandemic, which above all enabled us to rapidly put in place new ways of working that are more agile, more direct, and more flexible than before. We are monitoring our resources on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are allocated optimally to each growth opportunity,  we  are  innovating  constantly and  are  continuing  to  manage  our  portfolio dynamically. In terms of cost control, we have pooled our skills through the creation of Centres of Excellence, from IT to HR to innovation and consumer research, which are now available to everyone, freeing up time and energy to enable us to focus on what is essential: seizing every opportunity for growth in every market. And it is these new practices, behaviours, and mindsets that we are continuing to expand to ensure ever greater operational excellence.\n\nCrises often play the role of accelerator for both  existing  and  emerging  trends  and  the pandemic has been no different in this respect. In the light of Covid-19, I think it is fair to say\n\nthat  our  Transform  &  Accelerate  strategic plan  was  incredibly  far-sighted  and  a  great testimony to the strong insight we brought to its development. Our strategic intuitions have since become operational certainties, convincing us to fast-track our changes - even at the height of the pandemic. Our current plan has the strength of simplicity and the relevance of a proven vision, and we will remain in full deployment mode, focusing  on  out-sized  performance  to  outperform the competition.\n\n## 'Our strategic intuitions have since become operational certainties.'\n\nThe three critical areas of focus I would like to share with you as we look forward are talent management,  social  responsibility,  and  our digital transformation. The most important is obviously to manage our talents: if we are 'consumer-centric', we must also be 'employee-",

Our vision is to make Pernod Ricard the workplace of the future, blending performance and convivialit\u00e9 as our unique differentiating model, by focusing on diversity and inclusion, and striving to simplify our ways of working. The Island, our new home in Paris, is the reallife realisation of our vision for collaborating without silos, promoting well-being, flexibility, agility, and creativity in our working lives. This has also been reflected in our investment in other office locations such as London, with the coming together of Chivas Brothers, Global Travel Retail, PRUK and The Gin Hub.\n\nThe second major area of work is that of social responsibility, embodied by our 'Good Times from a Good Place' roadmap, and I would like to acknowledge here the work of all our teams on  Sustainability  &  Responsibility.  There  is real positivity to the progress we have made to date, while recognising that our ambitions and aspirations go much further. Since 2010, we have reduced the carbon emissions of our own operations by 17.5% in absolute value, and we are now committed to reaching net zero in our direct operations by 2030 at the latest and net zero overall by 2050. This involves working with all our supply chain - farmers, suppliers, and partners - to pick up the pace and level of investment in many critical areas as we position ourselves to meet and ideally exceed our goals. I would also like to see us take a pioneering position in regenerative agriculture and in the\n\ndevelopment of 'packaging of the future' within our  industry,  such  as  the  promising  paper bottle initiative developed by Absolut Vodka, in partnership with other industry leaders.\n\nAs for responsible consumption, it remains an integral part of everything we do, as shown by the training given last year to our employees, while on the consumer side, we launched a global 'Drink More\u2026 Water' campaign this summer to raise awareness among young adults. In the same spirit, we confirmed earlier this year that all our products will from now on bear a 'prohibited for minors' logo on their labels in addition to the warning labels already in place against drink driving and drinking during pregnancy.\n\nThe  last  area  of  focus,  and  certainly  the most transformative, is digital acceleration. The consumer is at the heart of our business model and data is nothing more than the digital signature of our consumers and their behaviour. I am not just talking about e-commerce, where our growth rates have exploded. Our ambition is much bigger. In the coming months, we will be presenting our Mission to transform Pernod Ricard  into  the  world's leading  Conviviality Platform Company. We will leverage the power of data and artificial intelligence to unleash the real power of our distribution network and our portfolio, enabling us to get the right product, at the right price, at the right time, to the right consumer, for every occasion, in every market.",

This is the Pernod Ricard of the future, and it will undoubtedly accelerate our path to leadership in our industry.\n\n## 'The pandemic has really confirmed our need to be together socially.'\n\nNever before in our history has our vision, 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de  convivialit\u00e9',  been  so  closely aligned with the aspirations of the 3.8/uni00A0billion people who today make up what is known as the global affluent and middle classes, and whose numbers are predicted to double again by 2050. Perhaps because of the hardship it created, the pandemic has really confirmed our need to be together socially. The gradual reopening of caf\u00e9s and restaurants led to real moments of joy and I am proud that our brands were part of these long-awaited events. How could anyone think for a moment that our restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s, and\n\nclubs were not essential when they bring such happiness to our lives? These partners were hit hard by the pandemic and the past few months have been critical for them. As I began this letter with our colleagues, I would like to wrap it up with a shout-out to the motivated and passionate women and men of the hospitality sector. We wanted  to  pay  tribute  to  them  through  our Carte Blanche, which this year brings together our employees and partners for the very first time. The campaign presented here represents Olivier  Culmann's long  journey  to  meet  the people who are deeply committed to keeping conviviality alive - even during a pandemic.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I salute you.",

At Pernod Ricard, we are:\n\n- \u00b7 Proud to belong to our company\n- \u00b7 Going the extra mile\n- \u00b7 Dedicated to our stakeholders\n\nPernod  Ricard  has  achieved  record  levels  of engagement, as evidenced by the latest editions of the independent I/uni00A0 Say employee opinion survey (1) y . For the past ten years, the levels of commitment, pride and support for the Group's values have been above external market benchmarks and in line with top performing organisations, according to external comparative data from our most recent employee opinion survey results. In 2019, 94% of our employees were proud to belong to Pernod Ricard. The organisation of Pernod Ricard's activities around its purpose, 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9,' has also earned it a place among the world's most admired companies (2) , the 'best employers' in France (3) and the companies preferred by business school students (4) .\n\n## OUR ECONOMIC MODEL/colon.case DECENTRALISATION\n\nWhile respecting the autonomy of our subsidiaries, we combine the strengths of a large group with the decision speed that decentralisation offers to local markets.\n\n- \u00b7 Decision-making based closely on the market\n- \u00b7 Fast responses to consumer needs\n\nThe Group pilots major cross-functional projects and pools certain areas of expertise so that local subsidiaries can focus on the essentials: growing their business in their market by putting the consumer at the centre of their efforts.

Furthermore, the Pernod Ricard Leadership Model also fosters this entrepreneurial spirit through a set of specific competencies such as cultivating innovation, courage, driving vision and purpose, decision quality, resourcefulness, etc., which are part of the six Leadership Attributes used globally for assessing, developing and growing our leaders and teams.\n\n## MUTUAL TRUST\n\n- \u00b7 Freedom of initiative\n- \u00b7 Open dialogue\n- \u00b7 Right to fail\n\nWe work in the spirit of cooperation and mutual trust. There can be no entrepreneurial spirit without trust in the person taking the initiative. In the same way, trust is the basis of our relationships both internally and externally. As part of our S&R\n\nroadmap, for example, we work with our partners to identify and map the social and environmental risks in our supply chains.\n\n## SENSE OF ETHICS\n\n- \u00b7 Respect\n- \u00b7 Transparency\n- \u00b7 Good relationships with stakeholders\n\nThere is no conviviality without responsibility and a strong sense of ethics. With this in mind, we launched a worldwide massive open online course (MOOC) on alcohol and responsible drinking. Mandatory for all our employees, its aim is both to inform and to encourage a strong individual commitment to responsible drinking. In addition to the nature of our business, which is the production and distribution of  alcoholic  products  and  its inherent need for a strong sense of responsibility, ethics is a core element of our culture and daily activity. In the same way that trust is inseparable from the entrepreneurial spirit, there can be no mutual trust without respect for others. Respect is one of the key ingredients for a diverse and inclusive corporate culture where everyone can be themselves and grow. As part of our Diversity & Inclusion roadmap, this year we launched  our new internal 'Live Without Labels' campaign and Catalysis Inclusion survey.\n\n## AN ATTITUDE/colon.case CONVIVIALITY, THE BASIS OF OUR PURPOSE\n\nConviviality is the last element of our Mindset, and probably the most important since the founding of Pernod Ricard. First, because our three core values only make sense if they are expressed within a convivial environment: there is no mutual trust or initiative without conviviality, which requires simple, informal, direct and transparent relationships. Second, conviviality is our purpose and our business. Our ambition is to transform any social interaction into a moment of authentic, sincere and responsible sharing. In today's uncertain environment, where we need to be ever more agile and fast-paced, conviviality serves as a performance accelerator by maximising exchanges and collaboration. In fact, 83% of our employees believe that conviviality is what makes Pernod Ricard unique (1) .\n\n(1) Data for the 2021 survey was not available at the time of this report, so the figures presented are taken from the July 2019 I Say survey, Willis Towers Watson.

They are our worldwide top priorities and the reference brands in each category.\n\nPrestige Brands, our portfolio of highly  desirable global  luxury brands, target our most affluent consumers all over the world. It is the industry's most comprehensive portfolio, spanning all major luxury categories and moments of conviviality.\n\nStrategic Wines cover a wide range  of  origins  and  tastes. Shared over a meal with friends or on more formal occasions, wine is increasingly appreciated around the world by a growing variety of consumers.\n\nSpecialty Brands meet a growing demand for smaller-scale 'craft' products. Authentic, these brands\n\n## PRIORITISING OUR INVESTMENTS\n\nUsing the House of Brands and in-depth consumer insight, we have developed the following categorisation to define the appropriate investment strategy according to the profile of each brand:\n\nStars our leading brands sold internationally or locally benefit from significant investment to enable them to continue leading the way in different categories and actively contribute to the Group's growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noffer a unique and comprehensive value proposition that responds to new consumer trends and expectations.\n\nStrategic Local Brands are strongly rooted brands in a limited number of specific markets. They benefit from very strong local consumer loyalty. This part of our portfolio is often a booster of our route-to-market.\n\nGrowth Relays also benefit from increased resources as they serve to capture different moments of conviviality in highly attractive categories and, at the same time, offer a promising growth outlook in the medium and long term.\n\nBastions, which are brands that are mature or in very competitive sales categories, receive enough investment to ensure that we protect their market share, sales and profits.\n\nThe House of Brands affords us the agility to make investment choices that strike the right balance between short-, medium-\n\nand long-term goals, while continuing to build brands that win throughout our must-win geographies.",

These qualities have laid the groundwork for our new mission: to become the world's leading Conviviality Platform. To achieve this, we will need to leverage digital and data to strengthen our connection with consumers, offer new experiences and increase the value of our portfolio.\n\n## A CONSUMER/hyphen.caseDRIVEN STRATEGY\n\nToday's consumer landscape is constantly in flux, shaped by a number of forces. Consumers are connected and searching for authentic experiences that are new and exciting, but that also mirror their social and environmental beliefs. Around the world, consumption patterns are evolving as the base of middle-class and affluent consumers grows in developing parts of the world, and mindsets continue to shift towards a preference for local consumption and genuine relationships with brands.\n\nTechnology and digital communication play a significant role in this transformation by disrupting the traditional relationship between businesses and customers, requiring brands to develop more innovative and personalised types of engagement.\n\nThese changes, which have accelerated with the Covid-19 crisis, have a direct impact on our business: for our strategic choices to best reflect their aspirations, it is essential to be even closer and more attentive to our consumers. Additionally, the rapid pace of change requires our decision-making to be quick and agile. For these reasons, the collection and analysis of the data that stakeholders share on social media or directly with our brands has become essential.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD, A CONVIVIALITY PLATFORM COMPANY\n\nAs 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9,' the Group's vision is to ensure that each of our brands is at the heart of every shared moment, transforming these social occasions into true experiences of conviviality. To honour this vision, as we embark on the decade that will lead us to 2030, we\n\nhave announced a new mission: to be the world-leading Conviviality Platform. We will do this by leveraging the role of data and innovative technologies in every aspect of our business. This is not a new strategy, but an evolution in our focus. By embracing data and cutting-edge technologies, we will be able to meet the challenges of tomorrow and achieve the ambition of our founders Paul Ricard and Jean H\u00e9mard: to be the wine & spirits industry leader.\n\n## 'TRANSFORM & ACCELERATE' TO WIN IN OUR BATTLEGROUNDS\n\nTo 'Prepare the Future' and accelerate our growth by getting 'More from the Core,' our strategic plan 'Transform & Accelerate' relies on our business model. This consumer -centric model is built around four Essentials, based on our historical strengths, and four Accelerators, aimed at responding to changing trends in our markets. Just as it helped us to weather the Covid-19 crisis of 2020 and 2021 with amazing resilience, this model is sufficiently agile to be the foundation of our future. It also enables us to be competitive in the four key battlegrounds identified in our strategic plan: we are accelerating growth by winning in key markets (US, China, India, Global Travel Retail) and e-commerce; building passion brands to bring conviviality to life; funding the journey in a responsible and profitable manner; and valuing people, from our employees and consumers to communities, partners and customers.",

To develop ever more relevant products and launches for increasingly demanding consumers, the collection and analysis of consumer data will form the core of our business strategy. In time, the Group will be able to promote a much larger number of brands in each market. Over the next decade, technology and data analysis will be the cornerstone of Pernod Ricard's business approach.\n\nWhile  our  ambition  to  become  the  world's premier  wine  and  spirits  company  has  not changed, the market has continued to evolve. In an increasingly fragmented landscape, we must continue to transform our business and work smarter to connect and engage with our stakeholders.\n\nBecoming a Conviviality Platform is not a new strategy but a logical evolution in our focus. It builds on our strengths, complements our current vision and will deliver competitive advantage for the future.\n\nConcretely,  we  wish  to  promote  direct  and transparent interactions that bring together all the players in our sector - particularly consumers, but also our partners, customers, wholesalers, brands and employees.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we will leverage the data generated by our activities to offer products and services that are increasingly relevant.\n\nAbove all, we must harness the power of data to offer the right product, at the right time, to the right consumer - in every market, for every occasion, and at the right price. When pertinent data is collected properly and respectfully, it is a real asset that we can capture and transform into useful information that allows us to optimise our rich portfolio, activate more brands in any given market and capitalise on growth opportunities. Today, we are able to efficiently activate around 10 brands in any given market. Tomorrow, we want to triple our distribution and activation capabilities to ensure that every product and service covers every possible moment of conviviality in a consistent manner.\n\nTechnology  is  showing  us  the  way.  Thanks to advances in data and new digital tools, our vision of being 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' can be infinitely more powerful. Our aim is to offer a onestop shop conviviality experience based on direct and transparent real-time interactions with all our stakeholders. With digital, our network will be limitless and we will reach even more convivialists.\n\nBecoming a Conviviality Platform is not about replacing real-life contacts, but enhancing them. As a data-driven company, we will be able to better understand and connect with all our stakeholders. True to our consumer-centric model, we will create the future of conviviality together. With artificial intelligence and insights from across the company, we can invent new products and services faster and meet ever more specific needs - including personalised  recommendations  for  our  trade partners. And through new skills, capabilities and ways of working, we can empower our teams.\n\nTo achieve this ambitious goal, we are accelerating our digital transformation, boosting our existing processes through data and new technology and reinventing the way we do business by exploring new opportunities.",

It is a key business driver and is proving an important lever to accelerate transformation, by driving innovation, building purposeful brands, attracting talents and bringing to life our vision of a more convivial world.\n\nVANESSA WRIGHT, CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR S&R ROADMAP WAS LAUNCHED IN /two.case/zero.case/one.case/nine.case, WHAT PROGRESS HAVE WE MADE SINCE THEN?\n\nV.W. More than just progress, we've seen a real acceleration in all four of our key pillars thanks to the drive and commitment of everyone at Pernod Ricard. We've met all of our 2020 environmental targets for CO 2 reduction, water consumption and waste disposal, and we've launched a number of initiatives to build a more inclusive culture and promote responsible consumption. The new global Diversity & Inclusion roadmap 'Live without labels' and our partnership with UNITAR (1) to  educate  drivers  about  the risks of drinking and driving are two good examples of this. Our S&R roadmap has been instrumental in responding to major environmental and social shifts and focusing the business on what matters most to our consumers and other stakeholders.\n\n## WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE IS KEY TO THE SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF OUR S&R AMBITION?\n\nV.W. As 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9', we believe in the power of human connections and bringing people together in a meaningful way to unlock the magic and strengthen what we do collectively. That's why we believe in a collaborative approach that includes all stakeholders from across our value chain - employees, farmers, suppliers, partners and communities. Our roadmap was developed through\n\nextensive consultation and collaboration between teams, external partners and experts, and is supported by multidisciplinary projects, most often carried out with the help of local or international organisations. We know that by sharing knowledge, challenging each other and trialling solutions together, we can learn and improve. We also have a strong S&R governance in place which was reinforced this year with the creation of a dedicated Board Committee on S&R, led by our Independent Lead Director.\n\n## WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE CHALLENGES AHEAD?\n\nV.W. Our S&R roadmap is instrumental in addressing consumer needs and material risks facing the Group today such as climate change and biodiversity loss. But everything is moving very quickly, so we need to continue to be agile and challenge ourselves to reach our targets even sooner. This year for example, we accelerated our carbon reduction targets with a commitment to reaching net zero in scopes 1 & 2 by 2030 at the latest and in scope 3 by 2050. Our work on future scenarios has helped confirm that our strategy addresses all the key risks and opportunities facing the Group, including securing our supply chain (especially raw agricultural materials), advancing circularity, ensuring the local relevance of our S&R roadmap and strengthening our preventive actions against the harmful use of alcohol.\n\n(1) The United Nations Institute for Training and Research.",

To ensure we maintain healthy and resilient ecosystems that allow us to continue producing quality products for the generations to come, we are committed to nurturing every terroir and its biodiversity. To address our agricultural footprint across the 325,000/uni00A0hectares from which we source our ingredients, we are developing sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices across our business.\n\n(1) SDG: Sustainable development goal\n\n## VALUING PEOPLE\n\nAs 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9', our purpose is about sharing, warmth, care and respect for people everywhere. We strive to provide decent work and sustained economic growth (SDG 8) along the entirety of our value chain, and we champion gender equality (SDG 5) throughout our business. To create shared value for all our stakeholders, we are continuously reinforcing our commitments to human rights, diversity and inclusion across our leadership and in regard to health and safety. We are also committed to responsible procurement and training, particularly for bartenders.\n\n## CIRCULAR MAKING\n\nThe world is made of finite resources that are under huge pressure. By contributing to responsible consumption and production (SDG 12) and protecting life below water (SDG 14), our goal is to help preserve natural resources. In moving towards a more circular business model from the packaging we use, to the promotional items we produce, to the way we distribute our products and how they are ultimately recycled - we are actively striving to minimise our carbon footprint and protect our natural resources.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE HOSTING\n\nWe want to ensure that our brands are enjoyed responsibly. Creating conviviality requires us to help adult consumers make responsible choices about whether and when to drink alcohol, and if they do so, in quantities that respect the maximum recommended levels of moderate consumption. We have an important role to play in combating the harmful use of alcohol and supporting health and well-being (SDG/uni00A03). To this end, we develop responsible drinking campaigns and programmes, on our own and in partnership with others, to inform consumers and our employees about the risks of excessive drinking. We have committed each of our brands to respecting responsible marketing practices.",

In  parallel,  we  have  also  developed  the  Key Principles  for  Sustainable  Agriculture,  which  we  are implementing across the business to ensure that 100% of our key raw materials are eventually certified sustainable. In  our  vineyards  and  terroirs,  we  are  working  with  our farmers, winemakers and partners to develop sustainable and  regenerative  agricultural  practices  that  help  with carbon  sequestration,  enhance  the  biodiversity  of  these exceptional ecosystems and guarantee long-term growth for all stakeholders.\n\n'From the moment I started working with the teams at Pernod Ricard, I was taken by their enthusiasm, passion and long-term commitment.

Composed of 13 members bringing complementary skills and experience, the Board ensures that the Group pursues its business strategy, with the primary goal of increasing the value of the Company.\n\n## ORGANISATION\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies, Pernod Ricard respects the independence criteria established in the Code. The Board is comprised of 13 members, six of whom are independent and two of whom represent Group employees. Following the recommendation of the Nominations, Governance and CSR Committee (now known as the Nominations and Governance Committee), as of 23/uni00A0January 2019, the Board appointed a Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Internal Regulations stipulate that the Board members must meet at least six times per year for meetings that are presided by the Chairman of the Board, who is also Pernod Ricard's Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman reports on the Board's progress at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. The Chairman is tasked with ensuring that the Group's bodies run smoothly, which includes providing the Directors with the information and resources they need to fulfil their duties. The role of the Lead Independent Director is notably to convene and chair the meetings of the Board of Directors in the absence of the Chairman and CEO; conduct the annual assessment of the functioning of the Board of Directors on the basis of individual interviews with each Director; prevent the occurrence of conflict of interest situations; ensure compliance with the rules of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the Board's Internal Rules and Regulations; convene and chair the Executive Session; review shareholder requests for corporate governance and ensure that they are answered; and meet with the Company's investors. In order to further root its work in the Group's daily business operations, the Board holds one meeting per year in an operating affiliate.\n\n## FY/two.case/one.case ACTIVITY\n\nOver the course of FY21, the Board met nine times, with an attendance rate of 100%. The average length of the meetings was approximately four hours.

The Strategic Committee - created and presided by Alexandre Ricard since 2015 - reviews key subjects for the Group, issues recommendations on acquisitions, divestitures and partnership projects and studies all strategic matters of interest to the Group. The Audit Committee notably reviews the half-year and annual draft financial statements, monitors the Group's cash flow and debt situation and assesses the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The Nominations and Governance Committee notably proposes new Directors and reviews the composition and operation of the Board, and the Group's performance and talent management policy. The CSR Committee notably examines, reviews and implements the Group's CSR strategy and assesses the risks and opportunities in terms of social and environmental performance. Lastly, the Compensation Committee notably defines the remuneration policy for the Group's Executive Directors, proposes a general long-term remuneration policy and implements an annual plan for the allocation of options and performance shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/three.case/zero.case./eight.case%\n\n/one.case/zero.case/zero.case%\n\nNON/hyphen.caseFRENCH DIRECTORS\n\nATTENDANCE RATE",

Regarding the determination of the selection criteria, the Nominations and Governance Committee takes into account the Board of Directors' diversity policy,not only in terms of expertise, but also in terms of independence, gender representation, nationality and/uni00A0seniority,as well as any specific expectations of the Board expressed during the evaluation of its functioning.\n\nOnce the needs of the Board of Directors have beenidentified and the selection criteria formalised, the Nominations and Governance Committee, with the support of a firm specialised in/uni00A0the recruitment of Directors, draws up a list of potential candidates. The Committee then organises interviews with the shortlisted candidates to ascertain their level of skills, their independence, availability,motivationand commitment to the Group's values.\n\nFollowing these interviews and after having reviewed the different profiles, the Nominations and Governance Committee makes its recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding the appointment of one or more candidates.The Board analyses the various profiles that have been submitted and present the appointment of the final candidates to the Shareholders' Annual Meeting.\n\n## Changes in the/uni00A0composition 2.5.4 of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board of/uni00A0Directors\n\n## During FY21\n\nTheShareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020 renewed the appointment of Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard, Mr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron and Mr/uni00A0Wolfgang Colberg as Directors for a term of four years expiring at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2024 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year. In/uni00A0addition, at the same Shareholders' Meeting, Ms/uni00A0Virginie Fauvel was appointed as a Directorfor a term of four years. Morever, Mr/uni00A0Gilles Samyn had informed the Board of Directors of his decision to resign from his position as Director at/uni00A0the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020.

Her term of office would be conferred for a term of four years expiring at the end of theShareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025 to approve the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors reviewed the candidate. In particular, they appreciated Ms Namita Shah 's high-level international career in CSR, legal and managerial functions, as well as her recent appointment to the Executive Committee of a CAC/uni00A040 company. Following a review, they also confirmed that Ms Namita Shah fulfilled the AFEP-MEDEFindependence criteriaadopted by the Company.\n\nThus, at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of 10/uni00A0November/uni00A02021, the Board of Directors would comprise 14/uni00A0members (including two Directors representing the employees), of which seven Independent Directors (58.3%) and six women (50%), in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the law on balanced representation of/uni00A0women and men within Boardsof Directors and professional equality.

his/her judgement (article/uni00A03 of the Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors).\n\nTherefore, the Board of Directors and the Nominations and Governance Committee use the following criteria to assess the independence of Directors in their annual review as well as in the event of a co-option, an/uni00A0appointment or a renewal.\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF independence criteria are the

annual Directors' independence review, and as in the previous financial year, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors raised the question of the independence of Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne, a Director with ties to GBL, given the passive crossing of the 10% voting rights threshold by GBL in February/uni00A02017 by virtue of the automatic acquisition of/uni00A0double voting rights. Please note that Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne's experience in finance as well as his in-depth knowledge of the Group are an asset to the Board of Directors of Pernod Ricard.\n\nAccording to the AFEP-MEDEF Code, Directors representing major shareholders of the Company may be considered as being independent, provided that these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company (criterion 8). At each crossing of a threshold of 10% of share capital or voting rights, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, is required to systematically review a Director's independence in the light of the composition of the Company's share capital and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAccordingly, it has been established that GBL does not participate in the control of Pernod Ricard and does not intend to do so as stated in the notification of threshold crossing published by the AMF on 23/uni00A0February 2017:\n\n- GBL has no relation with any other shareholder or the Ricard glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> family, the Group's reference shareholder;\n- Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne does not chair any of the Board Committees glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and is not a member of the Nominations and Governance Committee; and\n- GBL does not intend to ask for the appointment of other glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Directors.\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of/uni00A0Directors also noted the absence of conflicts of interest, since:\n\n- there is no significant business relationship between GBL and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Pernod Ricard or its Group that could create a situation of conflict of interest and which could compromise his freedom of/uni00A0judgement;\n- GBL's capital entry was made independently of any agreement glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> with Pernod Ricard or the Ricard family;\n- GBL has the reputation of being a diligent and demanding glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> investor whose interests are aligned with those of all shareholders;",

        "page_content": "- there is no agreement between GBL and Pernod Ricard or the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Ricard family relating to the presence of Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne or one or more GBL representatives on the Board of Directors. The presence of Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne is justified by his experience and his judgement, which are beneficial to the Board of Directors;\n- Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne is not in a position to impose his view on the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Board of Directors, which has 13/uni00A0members (including the Directors representing the employees); and\n- the breakdown of Pernod Ricard's capital is such that GBL glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> does not have a dominant position that enables it to impose its views at Shareholders' Meetings, or the power to block extraordinary decisions.\n\nThus, these elements demonstrate freedom of judgement and an absence of an actual or potential conflict of interest. In/uni00A0addition, it/uni00A0should be noted that there is no new element likely to call into question the qualification of independent retained in the past.\n\nGiven these facts, the Nominations and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors considered that Mr/uni00A0Ian Gallienne fully meet the'specific' independence criteria linked to the crossing of the threshold of 10% in share capital or voting rights.\n\nAfter considerationand review of the AFEP-MEDEF Code criteria mentionned above, the Board of Directors' meeting held on 21/uni00A0July 2021, in accordance with the recommendation of theNominations and Governance Committee, confirmed that six out of 11 Board members (excluding the Directors representing the employees) are/uni00A0deemed to be independent: Ms/uni00A0Patricia Barbizet, Ms/uni00A0Virginie Fauvel, Ms/uni00A0Anne Lange and Ms/uni00A0Kory Sorenson and Messrs/uni00A0Ian Gallienne and Philippe Petitcolin, representing more than half of the Board of Directors (54.5%), as required by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## Succession plan 2.5.6\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee, at the initiative of its Chairwoman, Lead Independent Director of the Board, periodically reviews the Group's succession plan. This allows her to establish and update a succession plan covering several time horizons:\n\n- short term: unexpected succession (resignation, incapacity, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> death);\n- medium term: accelerated succession (poor performance, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> lack/uni00A0of management); and\n- long term: planned succession (retirement, end of the term of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> office).\n\nThe Nominations and Governance Committee favours close collaboration with General Management in order to ensure overall consistency of the succession plan and to ensure a continuity in the key positions. In order to ensure the optimal development of the succession plan for the governing bodies and to meet the Company's strategicambitions, a regular assessment of potential candidates, their careers and developments is carried out with the assistance of an independent firm.\n\nIn addition, the Nominations and Governance Committee works closely with the Board of Directors on this subject, and is particularly vigilant in maintaining the confidentiality of this information.\n\n## Directors' Code of Conduct 2.5.7\n\nArticle/uni00A05 of the Internal Regulations, adopted by the Board of Directors on 17/uni00A0December 2002, most recently amended on 21/uni00A0April 2021, and/uni00A0article/uni00A016 of the bylaws stipulate therules of conduct that apply to Directors and their permanent representatives. Each Director acknowledges that he/she has read and understood these undertakingsprior to accepting the office.The Internal Regulations also outline the various rules in force with regard to the conditions for trading in the Company's shares on the stock market and the notificationand publication requirements relating thereto.\n\nMoreover, the Board of Directors' meeting of 16/uni00A0February 2011 adopted a Code of Conduct to prevent insider trading and misconduct in compliance with new legal undertakings, to comply with European regulations on market abuse.This Code was updated on 21/uni00A0April 2021.\n\nDirectors, as well as any person attending meetings of the Board and its Committees, have access to sensitive information concerning the Company. As such, they are bound by a strict obligation of confidentiality. Consequently, they must take all necessary measures to preserve the confidentiality of this information.\n\nAs theDirectors have sensitive information on a regular basis, they/uni00A0must refrain from using it to buy or sell shares of the Company and from carrying out transactions involving Pernod Ricard's shares or any related financial instruments in the forty-five days prior to the publication of the full-year results, the/uni00A0thirty days prior to the publication of the half-year results and the fifteendays prior to the publication of quarterly net sales. This period is extended to the day after the announcement when it ismadeafter the close of the markets (5.30pm, Paris time) and/uni00A0to the day of the announcement when it is made before the opening of the markets (9.00am, Paris time). In/uni00A0addition, the Code of Conduct states that they must seek the advice of the Ethics Committee before making any transactions involving the/uni00A0Company's shares or any related financial instrument.\n\n## Directors' Statement 2.5.8\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nTothe Company's knowledgeand at the date hereof, there are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties of any of the members of the Company's Board of Directors or General Management with regard to the Company in their capacity as corporate officers and their private interests or other duties.\n\nTothe Company's knowledgeand at the date hereof, there are no arrangements or agreements established with the main shareholders, clients, suppliers, bankers or consultants, relating to the appointment of one of the members of the Board of Directors or General Management.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge and at the date hereof, except as described in 'Shareholders' agreements' below, the members of the Board of Directors and General Management have not agreed to any restrictions concerning the disposal of their stake in the share capital of the Company, other than those included in the Internal Regulations and the Code of Conduct.\n\nIn accordance with the Board's Internal Regulations and in order to prevent any risk of conflict of interest, each member of the Board of Directors is required to declare to the Board of Directors, as soon as he/she becomes aware of such fact, any/uni00A0situation in which a conflict of interest arises or could arise between the Company's corporate interest and his/her direct or indirect personal interest, or the interests of a shareholder or group of shareholders which he/she represents.",

It/uni00A0is/uni00A0specified that this Charter formalises the process implemented to identify regulated agreementsand that such process is followed prior to concluding, amending, renewing or terminating any agreements which would potentially be qualified as regulated, it being specified that the process applies to agreements considered as 'free' at the time of conclusion.\n\n## Shareholders' agreements\n\nOn 8/uni00A0February 2006, Pernod Ricard was notified that a shareholders' agreement had been signed between Mr/uni00A0Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard. Pursuant to this agreement, Mr/uni00A0Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza undertakes to consult Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard prior to any Pernod Ricard Shareholders' Meeting in order for them to votethe same way. Furthermore, Mr/uni00A0Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza undertook to notify Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard of any additional purchase of Pernod Ricard shares and/or voting rights, and also undertook not to purchase any Pernod Ricard shares if such a transaction would force Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard and the parties acting in concert to launch a public offer for Pernod Ricard. Finally, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard has a pre-emption right with regard to any Pernod Ricard shares of which Mr/uni00A0Rafa\u00ebl Gonzalez-Gallarza may wish to dispose.\n\n## Absence of conviction for fraud, association with/uni00A0bankruptcy or any offence and/or official public sanction\n\nToPernod Ricard's knowledgeand at the date hereof:\n\n- no conviction for fraud has been issued against any members glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of the Company'sBoard of Directors or General Management over the last five years;\n- none of the members of the Board of Directors or General glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Management has been associated, over the last five years, with any bankruptcy, compulsory administration or liquidation as a member of a Board of Directors, Management Board or Supervisory Board or as a Chief Executive Officer;\n- no convictionand/or official public sanction has beenissued glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> over the last five years against any members of the Company's Board of Directors or General Management by statutory or regulatory authorities (including designated professional organisations); and\n- no Director or member of the General Management has, over glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the last five years, been prohibited by a court of law from serving as a member of a Board of Directors, a Management Board or Supervisory Board or from being involved in the management or the running of an issuer's business affairs.\n\n## Services agreements\n\nNo member of the Board of Directors or member of the General Management has any service agreement withPernod Ricard or any of its affiliates.\n\n## Employee representatives\n\nThe representant of the Social and Economic Committee on the Board of Directors is Mr/uni00A0Herv\u00e9 Jouanno (non-Director).\n\n## Structure and/uni00A0operation of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board of/uni00A0Directors 2.6\n\nThe operation of the Board of Directors is set forth in the legal and regulatory provisions, the bylaws and the Board's Internal Regulations adopted in 2002and last amended by the Board of Directors during its meeting on 21/uni00A0April 2021. The Internal Regulations of the Board of Directors specify the rules and operations of the Board, and supplement the relevant laws, regulations and bylaws. In particular, they remind the Directors of the rules on diligence, confidentiality and disclosure of possible conflicts of interest.\n\n## Meetings of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Board of/uni00A0Directors 2.6.1\n\nIt isthe responsibility of the Chairman to call meetings of the Board of Directors regularly, or at times that he or she considers appropriate. In/uni00A0order to enable the Board to review and discuss in detail the matters falling within their area of responsibility, the/uni00A0Internal Regulations provide that Board meetings must be/uni00A0held at least six times a year. In/uni00A0particular, the Chairman of the/uni00A0Board of Directors ensures that Board meetings are held\n\nto/uni00A0close the interim and annual financial statements and to convene the Shareholders' Meeting in charge of approving said statements.\n\nBoard meetings are called by the Chairman. The notice of the Board meeting, sent to the Directors at least eight days before the date of the meeting except in the event of a duly substantiated emergency, must/uni00A0set the agenda and state where the meeting will take place, which will be, in principle, the/uni00A0Company's registered office.Board meetings may also be held by video conference or teleconference, under the conditions provided for in the applicable regulations and the Internal Regulations.\n\nSince FY17, the Directors hold a session at least once a year without the Directors from the Group Top Management (Executive Sessions).The/uni00A0purpose of these Executive Sessions is/uni00A0to assess the operation of the Board of Directors, the&/uni00A0performance of the Executive Director, as well as the review of his succession plan.

A full report was drawn up for each audit covering the types of risks identified operational, financial, legal or strategic - and how they are managed. Recommendations are issued when/uni00A0deemed necessary. These are summarised for the Audit Committee, which is also regularly advised on/uni00A0the progress made in implementing the recommendations from previous audits;\n- approval of the Group internal audit plan for FY22 at the meeting held on 8/uni00A0June 2021.

An in-depth analysis is carried out in great detail at the time of reappointment.\n\nThe current compensation policy was defined by the Board of/uni00A0Directors on 31/uni00A0August 2021 on the proposal of the Compensation Committee.Pursuant to article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, this policy is subject to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting each year and upon each major change. In the absence of approval,the previously approved policy continues to apply.\n\n## General principles 2.8.1.1 review/uni00A0and/uni00A0implementation\n\n## for/uni00A0the/uni00A0determination, of/uni00A0the/uni00A0compensation policy for/uni00A0corporate officers\n\nThe Board of Directors follows the general guidelines, drawn up within the framework of the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, for the determination, review and implementation of its compensation policy.\n\nIt thus ensures that this compensation policy is consistent with the principles of compliance, comparability, competitiveness, comprehensiveness, motivation, performance, intelligibility of therules and measurement.\n\n## Compliance\n\nIn its analysis and proposals to the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee is particularly careful to follow the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which the Companyuses as reference.\n\n## Compliance with the corporate interest and/uni00A0relationship to/uni00A0strategy\n\nThe compensation policy adopted by the Board of Directors includes incentives that reflect the Group's strategy of long-term profitable growth through responsibleactions and compliance with the interests of the Company and its shareholders, both in terms of the correlation of compensation with the Company's short- and long-term performance and in terms of the policy of giving the executive a share of thecapital and the associated share of risk.\n\nThis compensation policy, which reflects the interests of the Company, is part of its business strategy and helps secure the Group's long-term future.The performance conditions of the compensation policy for corporate officers are directly linked to the Group's performance metrics.\n\nThus, the compensation policy of corporate officers:\n\n- reinforces the alignment of the interests of the Executive glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Director with the Company's corporate interest insofar as it is in line withand supports the Company's strategy;and\n- contributes to the Company's sustainability thanks in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> particular to its long-term compensation policy and its loyalty-building effects as well as its incentives for sustainable performance.\n\n## Comparability and competitiveness\n\nCompensation is based on the responsibilities assumed, the tasks performed, results obtained and market practices. Studies are regularly conducted with the assistance of consulting firms to measure compensation levelsand structures in relation to panels of comparable companies (in terms of both size and scope).\n\n## Comprehensiveness and balance\n\nCompensation components and other benefits are analysed individually and as a whole in order to achieve the best balance between fixed and variable, individual and collective, short-and long-term compensation.\n\n## Coherence\n\nThe Compensation Committee ensures that the compensation policy for the Executive Director is consistent with the compensation policy for the Group's employees, and in particular that of the members of the Executive Committee.",

As/uni00A0a/uni00A0result, the Chairman & CEO refrains from taking part in/uni00A0deliberations and voting on policies that concern him. In/uni00A0accordance with the provisions of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, an/uni00A0independent Director is a non-executive Corporate Officer of/uni00A0the Company orits Group and has no special ties with them.\n\n## Potential change of governance\n\nWhere a new Chairman and CEO, anew Chief Executive Officer or new Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s) is appointed, the componentsof the compensation and thepolicy and criteria set out in the Compensation policy for the Chairman and CEO shall also apply to them on a pro rata basis.The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, shall then, by means of adaptation to the situations of the interested parties, determine the objectives, performance levels, parameters, structure and maximum percentages compared to their fixed annual compensation, which may not be higher than those of the Chairman and CEO.\n\nFurthermore, as regards the annual variable compensation policy, in the event of the arrival of a new Executive Director during the second half of a financial year, the Board of Directors will conduct a performance assessment at its discretion based on a proposal from the Compensation Committee and, in that case, the new Director will receive as variable compensation the prorated amount of the variable portion approved by the shareholders.\n\nSimilarly, if a new Director is appointed, the elements of compensation, principles and criteria provided for in the Compensation Policy for Corporate Officers would also apply to/uni00A0him/her on a pro rata basis.\n\n## Compensation policy for Directors 2.8.1.2 (11 th /uni00A0resolution)\n\nThe conditions governing Directors' compensation within the total annual amount of corporate officer compensation authorised by theShareholders' Meeting are determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of a recommendation from the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Arrangements for allocating the compensation budget for FY21\n\nDirectors' annual compensation comprises a fixed portion set at \u20ac20,000, with an additional \u20ac6,000 formembers of the Audit Committee and \u20ac5,000 for members of the Strategic Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominations and Governance Committee, and the CSR Committee.The Chairman of theAudit Committee receives an additional sum of \u20ac14,000, while the Chairwomen of the Compensation Committee, the/uni00A0Nominations and Governance Committee, and the CSR Committee each receive an additional \u20ac8,500.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director receives additional annual compensation of \u20ac40,000.\n\nDirectors are also eligiblefor a variable portion, calculated on the basis of their attendance at Board and Committee meetings. The variable portion is \u20ac4,000 per meeting.\n\nFurthermore, in order to take account of distance constraints, an additional premium of \u20ac1,500 is paid to Directors who are not French tax residents, when they attend Board and/or Committee meetings. Directors who take part in Board meetings by video conference or conference call are not eligible for this additional amount.\n\nAs compensation, the Directors representing the employees receive a fixed annual payment of \u20ac15,000 for their attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and, as appropriate, those/uni00A0of the Board of Directors' Committees of which they are members.\n\nThe Chairman and CEO does not receive compensation in respect of his office as a Director.\n\nOf the \u20ac1,250,000 allocated by the Shareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, total compensation of \u20ac1,007,292 was paid to Directors in FY21, in accordance with therules set out above.\n\nForFY22, no change will be made to the amount and allocation of the budget applied for the previous financial year.",

Changes in the compensation policy of Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard had initially been considered at the time of the renewal of his term of office in November/uni00A02020; however the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors had preferred to postpone any changes until this year, given the health context and economic impact of Covid-19.\n\nThese proposed changes take into account:\n\n- the analysis of market practices of CAC/uni00A040 companies and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> peer panel companies with a view to aligning them with those of the CAC/uni00A040;\n- the excellent management of the Group by Mr/uni00A0Alexandre glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Ricard with, in particular, the strong development of the Group and the Group's buoyant market capitalisation (this has doubled since FY15 during which Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard was appointed Chairman and CEO);\n\nwhile ensuring stability until the end of the current term of/uni00A0office.\n\n## Compensation structure\n\nThe structure of the Executive Director's compensation consists mainly of:\n\n- cash compensation comprising a fixed portion and a variable glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> annual portion directly related to his or her individual performance and contribution to the Group's performance; and\n- capital compensation in the form of an allocation of shares glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> whose vesting is subject to the achievement of performance conditions in line with shareholders' interests.\n\n## Components of compensation\n\n| Fixed compensation                           | \u20ac1,250,000                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variable compensation                        | Target: 110% - Max: 180% (Quantitative criteria: target 80%/max 150% - Qualitative/uni00A0criteria: target 30%/max 45%)        |\n| Long-term profit-sharing plan                | Max 150% of fixed annual compensation, subject to performance conditions                                                       |\n| Supplementary pension scheme                 | 20% of fixed and variable compensation (10% in performance shares and 10% in/uni00A0cash)                                      |\n| Deferred commitments                         | Non-compete clause + Imposed departure clause: combined maximum of 24 months' compensation (fixed and variable)                |\n| Multi-year/exceptional variable compensation | Any multi-year variable compensation or exceptional compensation shall be precisely communicated and justified.

However, an early review might occur in the event of significant changes to their scope of responsibilities or a major deviation compared to the market positioning. In/uni00A0these specific situations, the adjustment of the fixed compensation and the reasons for it will be made public.\n\nFinally, the Board of Directors has decided that, in the event of the appointment of a new Chairman and CEO, a new Chief Executive Officer or new Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s), these/uni00A0same principles will apply.\n\nIn light of the exceptional circumstances in 2020, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors decided, on 1/uni00A0September 2020, to postpone the review of Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard's compensation by one year, despite the exceedingly high quality of his performance and the renewal of his term of office.\n\nAccordingly, on 31/uni00A0August 2021, the Board of Directors decided, on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, to increase the fixed annual compensation of Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard to \u20ac1,250,000 until the end of his term of office, so that it is more closely aligned with the median practices of the CAC/uni00A040, given that Pernod Ricard's market capitalisation is above the median of the CAC/uni00A040.\n\nIn this decision, the Board of Directors took into consideration:\n\n- the acceleration of Group Pernod Ricard's financial glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance since his appointment in 2015;\n- the excellent management during the health crisis which glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> confirmed Mr Alexandre Ricard's leadership;\n\n- the analyses carried out by two independent external firms glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> which revealed agap between his compensation (both fixed and total) compared to the median practice of CAC/uni00A040 companies and a greater gap with companies in the beverage sector (i.e. external condition panel);and\n- fixed compensation of Mr Alexandre Ricard unchanged since glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> August 2018.\n\nThe Board of Directors also ensured that this review was coherent with the compensation and salary conditions of the Group's employees, particularly in France.\n\n## Compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Executive Director does not receive compensation for offices he or she holds in the Company or in Group companies.\n\n## Variable annual portion\n\nThe purpose of variable annual compensation is to compensate the performance achieved during the financial year by the Executive Director in terms of the annual performance objectives set by the Board of Directors in accordance with the corporate strategy.Pursuant to the provisions of article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, the payment of variable annual compensation is conditional upon its prior approval by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting ('ex-post' vote).\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee strive to strengthen the link between performance and compensation and to integrate corporate social responsibility.\n\nMore specifically, this variable portion is based on performance levels applying to financial and non-financial parameters, representative of expected overall performance.\n\nThis variable portion is expressed as a percentage of the fixed annual portion. It may vary between 0% and 110% if the quantitative and qualitative objectives are achieved (target level) and may rise to a maximum of 180% if the Group records exceptional financial and non-financial performance in relation to the objectives.",

For FY22, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, proposes that the following criteria be reapplied:\n\n|                                                | Achievement of budgeted profit from recurring operations , restated for exchange rate and scope effects. This criterion, intended to provide an incentive to exceed the target for profit from recurring operations, is one of the key elements of the Group's decentralised structure. This concept of commitment to the budgeted profit from recurring operations helps to bring together all of the structures, which are rewarded according to the extent to which they meet their own targets for profit from recurring operations. This criterion rewards the management performance of the Executive Director.   | Target 20% Maximum 37.5%   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Quantitative criteria: target 80% maximum 150% | Achievement of budgeted Group net profit from recurring operations , restated for exchange rate and scope effects. This criterion takes into account all of the Group's financial data that fall under the Executive Director's responsibility for the financial year and thus makes it possible for his compensation to be aligned as closely as possible with that of the shareholders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Target 20% Maximum 37.5%   |\n| Quantitative criteria: target 80% maximum 150% | Achievement of budgeted recurring free cash flow , restated for exchange rate and scope effects.

However, it should be noted that no compensation shall be paid if the Executive Director is dismissed for gross negligence or with good cause or on decision of the Board of Directors.\n\n## PAYMENT METHOD\n\nIn accordance with the law, the payment of variable annual compensation will be conditional upon prior approval by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Stock option and performance-based share allocation policy\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that share-based compensation mechanisms, which also benefit other key functions of the Company, are particularly appropriate for the Executive Director, given the level of responsibility of this function and his or her ability to contribute directly to long-term corporate performance in a way that is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors ensures that the performance conditions are consistent with those applied to the Group's Senior Managers, particularly the members of the Executive Committee.\n\nDuring FY21, the Board of Directors reaffirmed its desire to give key personnel an interest in the performance of Pernod Ricard shares, and during its meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, it decided to introduce a combined allocation plan made up of stockoptions and performance shares.\n\nThe Board's aim is therefore to continue to align the interests of Pernod Ricard employees with those of the shareholders, by/uni00A0encouraging them to hold shares of the Company. Just over 750/uni00A0employees were rewarded, making it possible to target not only executives in management positions, but also to retain young high-potential Managers (Talents) in all of the Group's affiliates around the world.\n\nFor the future, the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 November 2021 will be asked to authorise the Board of Directors to allocate free performance shares to employees and Executive Directors of the Company and Group companies (resolution no. 22), subject to the performance conditions detailed below. The Board of Directors wished to align itself with the market practices of CAC40companies by eliminating stock options and to introduce a corporate social responsibility criterionin line with its roadmap in this area.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED SHARES\n\nThe performance shares granted will have a vesting period of three years and will be subject to the following performance conditions:\n\n- 50% of the allocation of performance-based shares, by value, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> will besubject to an internal performance condition linked to a criterion relating to profit from recurring operations;\n- 30% of the performance-based share allocation, by value, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> will/uni00A0besubject to a relative external performance condition (TSR/uni00A0 versus a peer panel);\n- 20% of the performance-based share allocation, by value, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> will/uni00A0besubject to an internal performance condition relating to/uni00A0CSR criteria.",

The composition of the Panel may be modified depending on changes in the companies, particularly in the event of acquisition, absorption, dissolution, spin-off, merger or change of activity, subject to maintaining the overall consistency of the sample and enabling application of the external performance condition in accordance with the performance objective set on allocation.\n\nThe number of performance shares that vest will be determined based on the achievement of the following criteria assessed over a period of three consecutive financial years (including the year during which the shares were allocated):\n\n- Carbon: implementation of the roadmap to reduce the direct CO2 emissions generated glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> by/uni00A0our sites in order to achieve zero net emissions by 2030.\n- Water: implementation of the roadmap, which aims to reduce the water consumption glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of/uni00A0our distilleries by 20% by 2030.\n- Responsible consumption: Pernod Ricard's strategic brands will launch marketing glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> campaigns focused on responsible drinking, with the aim of ramping this up each year over the next five years.\n- Employees: objective of achieving gender diversity in our Top Management (at least 40% glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of each gender) by 2030.\n\nThe Board of Directors will determine, at the time of each allocation, the quantified objectives to be achieved for each of these four criteria.\n\nNumber of shares that vest:\n\n- if no objectives are achieved: no shares will vest; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- if one objective is achieved: 25% of the shares will vest; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- if two objectives are achieved: 50% of the shares will vest; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- if three objectives are achieved: 75% of the shares will vest; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- if four objectives are achieved: 100% of the shares will vest. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>",

However, there would be no payment in the event of i) non-renewal of the term of office, ii) departure initiated by the Director, iii) a changeof functions within the Group or iv) if/uni00A0he or she is ableto benefit in the near future from their pension rights.\n\nThe imposed departure clause is subject to the following three performance criteria:\n\n- criterion number/uni00A01: bonus rates achieved over the term(s) of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> office: criterionnumber/uni00A01 will be considered as met if the average bonus paid over the entire length of the term(s) of office is no less than 90% of the target variable compensation;\n- criterion number/uni00A02: growth rate of profit from recurring glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> operations over the term(s) of office: criterion number/uni00A02 will be considered as met if the average growth rate of profit from recurring operations vs. budget of each year over the entire length of the term(s) of office is more than 95% (adjusted for foreign exchangeand scope impacts); and\n- criterion number/uni00A03: average growth in net sales over the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> term(s) of office: criterion number/uni00A03 will be considered as met if/uni00A0the average growth in net sales over the entire length of the term(s) of office is greater than or equal to 3% (adjusted for foreign exchangeand scope impacts).\n\nThe amount of compensation that may be received under the imposed departure clause shall be calculated according tothe following scale:\n\n- if all three criteria are met, payment of 12/uni00A0months' glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> compensation/uni00A0 (1) ;\n- if two of the three criteria are satisfied: payment of eight glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> months' compensation/uni00A0 (1) ;\n- if one of the three criteria is satisfied: payment of fourmonths' glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> compensation/uni00A0 (1) ; and\n- if no criterionis satisfied: no compensation will be paid. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n## NON-COMPETE CLAUSE\n\nThe signing of this non-compete clause for a period of one year is intended to protect the Group by preventing the Executive Directorfrom performing duties for a competitor, in return for an allowance of 12/uni00A0months' compensation (last fixed and variable annual compensation, determined by the Board of Directors).\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n- the indemnity will be paid monthly during its term; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- it is provided in this clause that the Board of Directors may glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> waive the application of this clause when the Executive Director leaves;\n- the indemnity will not be paid if the Executive Directorleaves glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the Group to take retirement or if the Executive Directoris over 65/uni00A0years old;and\n- the maximum amount of the indemnity under the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> non-compete clause and the imposed departure clause (sum/uni00A0of both) is capped at 24/uni00A0months' compensation (last/uni00A0fixed and variable annual compensation approved by the/uni00A0Board of Directors).",

        "page_content": "## Supplementary pension scheme\n\nThe supplementary pension scheme supplements the retirement schemes provided under compulsory basic and supplementary schemes.\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, decided at its meeting of 31/uni00A0August/uni00A02021 to modify the level of the supplementary pension scheme implemented in 2016. This change was analysed in the/uni00A0light of market practices and in order to align itself as closely as possible with the CAC/uni00A040, both in terms of structure and level.\n\nThe Executive Director would therefore receive additional annual compensation equal to 20% of his fixed and variable annual compensation, paid each year:\n\n- half ( i.e. 10%) in the form of the allocation of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance-based shares, the number of which will be determined based on the IFRS value of shares when the allocation occurs,and which must be approved by the Board of Directors each year. The conditions relating to performance, presence and holding that will apply to these allocations will be the same as those outlined under the general Group performance-based share allocation plan in effect on the grant date; and\n- half ( i.e. 10%) in cash.It is specified that the Executive Director glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> will undertake to invest the cash component of this additional compensation he may receive, net of social security contributions and tax, in savings products dedicated to financing his supplementary pension.\n\n## Multi-year compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided not to use this type of long-term cash compensation mechanism, preferring to favour a share-based instrument more closely aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nHowever, such a mechanism might be envisaged if regulatory changes or any other circumstance were to make the use of a share-based instrument restrictive or impossible. In this event, the principles and criteria for the determination, distribution and maximum allocation of shares stipulated in the policy relating to share plans will be used in the structuring of such variable multi-year compensation using the most similar appropriate procedures possible.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code (24.3.4), the/uni00A0Board of Directors has adopted the principle by which the Executive Director may receive a special bonus in certain circumstances (particularly in the case of transformational operations), which must be explicitly disclosed and justified.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code (article 24.4), in the case of external recruitment of a new Executive Director, the Board of Directors may also decide to pay an amount (in cash or in shares) to compensate the new Executive Director for loss of all or part of his or her compensation (excluding retirement benefits) related to leaving his or her previous position. This compensation may not exceed the amount lost by the person in question.\n\nIn all cases, the payment of such compensation may only be made subject to the prior approval of the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## COMPANY CAR\n\nFor fulfilling his or her duties as a representative of the Company, the/uni00A0Executive Director has a company car. Insurance, maintenance and fuel costs are borne by the Company.\n\n## COLLECTIVE HEALTHCARE AND WELFARE SCHEMES\n\nThe Executive Director enjoys the benefit of the collective healthcare and welfare schemes offered by the Company under the same terms as those applicable to the category of employees to which they belong for the determination of their welfare benefits and other additional components of their compensation.\n\n## Exception to the implementation of the compensation policy for the Chairman and CEO\n\nIn accordance with the second paragraph of/uni00A0III of article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-8 of the French Commercial Code, in the event of exceptional circumstances, the Board of Directors may depart from applying elements of the compensation policy, provided that such a departure is temporary, is in the Company's interest and is necessary to ensure the Company's continued existence or viability. Any departure will be decided by the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and after obtaining the opinion, where necessary, of/uni00A0an independent consulting firm, it being understood that reasons must be given for this departure.\n\nSuch a departure may only be temporary and in exceptional circumstances, in particular a major event affecting markets in general or that of wines & spirits in particular.\n\nThe compensation elements that may be departed from, in either a positive or negative sense, are the annual or long-term variable compensation (but without the limits being modified).",

It may reach 70% of his gross fixed compensation if the quantitative and qualitative targets are achieved (target level) and can rise to a maximum of 105% if the Group records exceptional financial performance in relation to the targets. The/uni00A0criteria are reviewed regularly and may be modified on an occasional basis.\n\nIn this respect, during FY21, he received gross variable compensation in October/uni00A02020 of \u20ac228,949 relating to FY20, i.e. 46.86% of his fixed compensation for FY20.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL COMPENSATION\n\nNo exceptional compensation was awarded or paid in respect of/uni00A0FY21.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF STOCK OPTIONS AND/OR PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\nOn 27/uni00A0November 2020, the Board of Directors authorised a combined stock option and performance-based share allocation plan.\n\nUnder this plan, Mr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron received the following allocation:\n\n- 6,517/uni00A0stock options with an external performance condition glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> (\u20ac153,345 at IFRS value); and\n- 2,078 performance shares with an internal performance glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> condition (\u20ac306,711 at IFRS value).\n\nThe detailsof the overall stock option and performance-based share allocation policy are shown below (pages/uni00A082-83 of this universal registration document).\n\n## SEVERANCE BENEFITS\n\nMr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron receives no compensation for termination of/uni00A0service.\n\n## SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION SCHEME\n\nMr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron has a conditional supplementary defined-benefit pension scheme (article/uni00A039) under article/uni00A0L./uni00A0137-11 of the French Employment Code, provided that recipients:\n\n- have at least 10/uni00A0years' seniority within the Group whenthey glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> leave or retire;\n- are at least 60/uni00A0years of age on the date of leaving or retirement; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- have claimed the basic and complementary French social glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> security pension schemes (ARRCO, AGIRC);\n- permanently end their professional career;and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- end their professional career within the Group. In accordance glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> with regulations, employees aged over 55 whose contract is terminated and who do not take up another job are deemed to have retired.The aim of the scheme is to make it possible to supplement the pension provided by France's mandatory state-run pension scheme. It offers retired beneficiaries a life annuity that can be passed on to their spouse and/or ex-spouse in the event of death.\n\nPensions are proportionate to the beneficiary's length of service, with an upper limit of 20/uni00A0years. Pensions are calculated on the basis of the beneficiary's average compensation (fixed and variable) over thethree years preceding his or her retirement.\n\nThe amount of the supplementary annuity is calculated by applying the following coefficients to the basis of calculation:\n\n- for the portion of the compensation between 8 and 12/uni00A0times glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> France's annual social security ceiling,the coefficient is 2% multiplied by the number of years' service (capped at 20/uni00A0years, i.e. 40%);\n- between 12 and 16/uni00A0times France's annual social security ceiling, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the coefficient is 1.5% per year of service (capped at 20/uni00A0years, i.e. 30%);and\n- in excess of 16/uni00A0times France's annual social security ceiling, the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> coefficient is 1% per year of service (capped at 20/uni00A0years, i.e. 20%).\n\nThe supplementary pension equals the sum of the three amounts above.\n\nIn addition, the rights granted under this plan, added to those of other pensions, cannot exceed two-thirdsof the amount of the beneficiary's most recent fixed annual compensation.\n\nA provision is entered on the balance sheet during the build-up phase and, when the beneficiary claims his or her pension, the capital is transferred to an insurer and thus entirely outsourced.\n\nFunding for this scheme is the responsibility of Pernod Ricard, which pays premiums to a third-party insurance agency to which it has entrusted management of this pension scheme.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article/uni00A0D./uni00A022-10-16 of the French Commercial Code, at 30/uni00A0June 2021, the estimated gross amount of the pension potentially paid under the supplementary defined-benefit pension scheme for Mr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron would amount to \u20ac151,781 per year.\n\nTherelevant social security contributions falling due to Pernod Ricard stood at 24% of the contributions transferred to the insurer.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the government decree of /uni00A03/uni00A0July 2019:\n\n- thescheme has been closed since 2016; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- no additional rights may vest in respect of periods glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of/uni00A0employment after 1/uni00A0January 2020.",

This valuation corresponds to a historical value at the grant date calculated\n\nThe scope of employees included only covers employees who were present continuously for two consecutive financial years. For part-time employees, compensation has been established on the basis of full-time equivalents.\n\nThe ratios and annual changes in compensation were calculated on the basis of the gross compensation components paid or awarded in the current year (thus including the variable compensation and profit-sharing allocated in respect of theprior year).\n\nThe legal scope of this information covers Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA.

        "page_content": "## Taking into account the last vote of the Shareholders' Meeting of 27 November 2020\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, took into account the vote of the Shareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, which saw strong shareholdersupport (97.19% for the 'ex post' vote and 94.23% for/uni00A0the 'ex ante' vote) for the compensation policy put in place within the Group, and therefore decided to continue this policy according to the same principles and arrangements for FY22.\n\n## Other aspects of the compensation 2.8.4 policy (not subject to shareholder vote)\n\n## Overall stock option and performance-based share allocation policy\n\nDuring FY21, the Board of Directors reaffirmed its desire to give key personnel an interest in the performance of Pernod Ricard shares, and during its meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, it decided to introduce a combined allocation plan made up of stock options and performance shares.\n\nThe Board's aim is therefore to continue to align the interests of Pernod Ricard employees with those of the shareholders, by/uni00A0encouraging them to hold shares of the Company. Just over 750/uni00A0employees were rewarded, making it possible to target not only executives in management positions, but also to retain young high-potential managers (Talents) in all of the Group's affiliates around the world.\n\nThe 27/uni00A0November 2020 allocation plan consists of stock options with performance conditions and performance shares.\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed the following plan features on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee:\n\n- subject all allocations (stock options and performance shares) glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> to performance criteria;\n- retain the external performance criterionapplicable to stock glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> options and a portion of the performance shares allocated to the Executive Director: positioning of the overall performance of Pernod Ricard shares compared with the overall performance of a panel of12 comparable companies over three years, only considering positioning on the median or higher;\n- maintain the internal performance criterion applicable to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance shares, i.e. the averageachievement of annual targetsfor profit from recurring operations, assessed over three consecutive financial years;\n- maintain a balanced allocation between stock options and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance shares for the members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, thus allowing fair compensation based on the achievement of internal and external criteria; and\n- maintain allocations of performance shares for all glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> beneficiaries, with the volume varying according to the classification of their position within the Group.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF STOCK OPTIONS WITH EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nThe volume of stock options with performance conditions allocated by the Board of Directors' meeting of 27/uni00A0November/uni00A02020/uni00A0stood at 136,711/uni00A0stock options.\n\nAll of the stock options under the plan are subject to an external performance condition and will become exercisable from November/uni00A02024 depending on the positioning of the overall performance of Pernod Ricard shares compared to the overall performance of a panel of 12 comparable companies. This/uni00A0condition will be evaluated over a three-year period following the plan allocation.\n\nThe number of shares that will ultimately be granted will be determined by comparing the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share and the overall performance of a Panel from 27/uni00A0November 2020 to 27/uni00A0November 2023 inclusive (three years). Accordingly, if the total performance of the Pernod Ricard shares (TSR) is:\n\n- below the median (8 th /uni00A0to 13 th position), no options will be glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> exercisable;\n- at the median (7 th 7 7 position), 66% of the options will be glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> exercisable;\n- in 6 th , 5 th or 4 th position, 83% of the stock options will be glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> exercisable; and\n- in 3 rd , 2 nd or 1 st position, 100% of the stock options will be glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> exercisable.\n\nAt the grant date, the Board of Directors decided that the Panel shall comprise, in addition to Pernod Ricard, the following 12 companies:/uni00A0AB/uni00A0InBev, Brown Forman, Campari, Carlsberg, Coca-Cola, Constellation Brands, Danone, Diageo, Heineken, LVMH,PepsiCo and R\u00e9my Cointreau.\n\nThe Panel's composition is subject to change, based on the above-mentioned companies' development. The Board of Directors shall, with a duly reasoned decision and following the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, exclude a company from or add a new company to the Panel, for example, in the case of an acquisition, absorption, dissolution, spin-off, merger or change of business of one or more of the Panel's members, subject to maintaining the overall consistency of the Panel and enabling the application of the external performance condition in line with the performance objective set upon allocation.\n\nThe vesting period for the stock options is four years followed by/uni00A0an exercise period of four years.",

This external condition will be assessed over a period of three years following the allocation of the plan, i.e. from 27/uni00A0November/uni00A02020 to 27/uni00A0November 2023 inclusive.\n\nThe final volumes will be determined at the end of the external condition evaluation period in accordance with subsection 'Allocation of stock options'.\n\n## ALLOCATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED SHARES WITH/uni00A0INTERNAL CONDITION\n\nA total of 262,530 performance shares (excluding shares related to the supplementary pension scheme) were awarded by the Board of Directors at its meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, all/uni00A0subject to the internal performance condition described below.\n\nThe number of performance shares that will ultimately be granted will be determined based on the ratios of achievement of/uni00A0the Group's profit from recurring operations, adjusted for currency effects and changes in the scope of consolidation as compared with the Group's budgeted profit from recurring operations over three consecutive financial years (FY21, FY22 and FY23).\n\nThe number of performance shares is determined according to/uni00A0the following conditions:\n\n- if the average level of achievement is 0.95 or below: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> no/uni00A0performance shares will vest;\n- if the average level of achievement is between 0.95 and 1: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the/uni00A0number of performance shares that vest is determined by applying the percentage of linear progression between 0 and 100%; and\n- if the average level of achievement is 1 or more: 100% of the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance shares will vest.\n\nPerformance shares allocated to all beneficiaries have a four-year vesting period, without a lock-in period.\n\nIn addition, beneficiaries must still be part of the Group on the vesting date, except in the case of retirement, death or invalidity.\n\n## History of allocations of stock options - Situation at 30/uni00A0June 2021 (Table/uni00A08 AMF nomenclature)\n\n|                                                                    | LTIP 2015   | LTIP 2016   | LTIP 2017   | LTIP 2018   | LTIP 2019   | LTIP 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Plan number                                                        | 27B         | 28B         | 29B         | 30B         | 31B         | 32B         |\n| Date of authorisation by Shareholders' Meeting                     | 06.11.2015  | 06.11.2015  | 06.11.2015  | 06.11.2015  | 08.11.2019  | 08.11.2019  |\n| Date of Board of Directors' meeting                                | 06.11.2015  | 17.11.2016  | 09.11.2017  | 21.11.2018  | 08.11.2019  | 27.11.2020  |\n| Type of options                                                    | Purchase    | Purchase    | Purchase    | Purchase    | Purchase    | Purchase    |\n| Total number of options that can be subscribed or/uni00A0purchased | 278,575     | 150,008     | 124,050     | 109,492     | 131,864     | 136,711     |\n| Of which by corporate officers of Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA          | 28,200      | 39,445      | 32,050      | 32,006      | 28,831      | 29,891      |\n| Of which by Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard                             | 20,700      | 31,400      | 25,050      | 26,143      | 22,545      | 23,374      |\n| Of which by Mr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron                                  | 7,500       | 8,045       | 7,000       | 5,863       | 6,286       | 6,517       |\n| Commencement date for exercise of options                          | 07.11.2019  | 18.11.2020  | 10.11.2021  | 22.11.2022  | 09.11.2023  | 28.11.2024  |\n| Expiry date                                                        | 06.11.2023  | 17.11.2024  | 09.11.2025  | 21.11.2026  | 08.11.2027  | 27.11.2028  |\n| Subscription or purchase price (\u20ac) (1)                             | 102.80      | 105.81      | 126.53      | 137.78      | 162.79      | 154.11      |\n| Number of shares subscribed or purchased                           | 113,332     | 41,953      | -           | -           | -           | -           |\n| Total number of stock options cancelled or lapsed/uni00A0 (2)      | 96,068      | 32,183      | 46,797      | 5,863       | 6,286       | -           |\n| Of which those of Mr/uni00A0Alexandre Ricard                       | 7,038       | 5,338       | 8,517       | -           | -           | -           |\n| Of which those of Mr/uni00A0C\u00e9sar Giron                            | 2,550       | 1,368       | 2,380       | -           | -           | -           |\n| Subscription or purchase options remaining                         | 69,175      | 75,872      | 77,253      | 103,629     | 125,578     | 136,711     |\n\nN/A: not applicable.\n\nAs of 30/uni00A0June 2021, there were 588,218/uni00A0stock purchase options outstanding, representing approximately 0.22% of the Company's share capital.

In line with the Group's decentralised structure, the terms and conditions of each of these agreements are negotiated at the level of each entity concerned.\n\nSimilarly, outside France, the Group encourages all affiliates to implement local agreements enabling employees to share inthe profits of the entity to which they belong.\n\nProfit-sharing agreements of this type exist in countries including Ireland and the United Kingdom: in each of these countries, employees may potentially receive Pernod Ricard shares based on their entity's annual results.\n\n## PROVISION FOR PENSION BENEFITS\n\nDetails of the total amount of provisions recorded or otherwise recognised by the issuer for the payment of pensions are set out in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nThe Compensation Committee members are kept regularly informed of changes in the compensation given to members of the Executive Committee.They ensure consistency between the compensation policy for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee and the integration of social responsibility criteria in their variable compensation.\n\nIn regularly reviewing the various aspects of compensation, the members of the Compensation Committee pay particular attention to ensuring that the policy applied to the Group's Executive Director is consistent with thepolicy applied to the members of the Group's Senior Management both in France and internationally.\n\nThe compensation of the members of the Executive Board (excluding the Chairman and CEO), which is set by General Management, comprises a fixed annual portion, plus a variable portion representing an attractive incentive, for which the criteria are largely based on the Group's financial performance, as is the case for the Executive Director. Qualitative criteria to evaluate individual performance are also applied to this variable financial portion.\n\nTheChairmen of the Group's direct affiliates, who are members of the Executive Committee, also receive compensation comprising a fixed portion, which is set in proportion to individual responsibilities, plus a variable portion, for which the quantitative criteria depend firstly on the financial performance of the entity they manageand secondlyonthe Group's results, with a view to strengthening solidarity and collegiality. The/uni00A0Chairmen are also evaluated using individual qualitative criteria.\n\nThe same performance indicators thus apply to the key players in the Group's business development, through the structure of and the method for evaluating the variable portion of their annual compensation.\n\nFor a number of years, all members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, have also been evaluated on the basis of their employee development and management performance and the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects.\n\nTotal fixed compensation awarded to the members of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, amounted to \u20ac7.3/uni00A0million for FY21 (compared to \u20ac7.7/uni00A0million for/uni00A0FY20). In addition to this, variable compensation (relating to/uni00A0FY20) of \u20ac3.1/uni00A0million was paid (compared with \u20ac7.1/uni00A0million in FY20). This significant variation between the two financial years is due to the negative impact of the health crisis on the Group's financial results, i.e. the quantitative portion of the variable compensation.\n\nThe total recurring expense in respect of pension commitments formembers of the Executive Committee, including the Executive Director, was \u20ac1.7/uni00A0million in the financial statements for the year ended 30/uni00A0June 2021 (compared with \u20ac4.8/uni00A0million as at 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02020). This significant variation between the two financial years is due tothe fact that certain members of the Executive Committee received, in exchange for the elimination of the supplementary pension scheme with conditional rights decided in 2016, a cash compensation payment in respect of past service, smoothed over three years, for which the finalpayment was made during FY20.",

The Company also purchased 210,000/uni00A0shares through the exercise of American call options. 50,000/uni00A0stock options (American calls) were also unwound early.\n\nPursuant to authorisations granted by the Combined Shareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November 2020, the Board of Directors of the same date implemented a stock option allocation plan and a performance-based share allocation plan.\n\nAreallocation of shares acquired on the stock market in previous years to cover various stock option or performance-based share plans and the125,000 American calls, which enabled the same number of Pernod Ricard shares to be acquired, were allocated to cover part of these stock option and performance-based share allocation plans.\n\nTreasury shares constitute reserves covering the various stock option and performance-based share allocation plans still in force. During the period, transfers were made within these reserves of treasury shares: 359,402/uni00A0shares were allocated to beneficiaries of the performance-based share plan of 17/uni00A0November 2016 (at the end of the four-year vesting period), in/uni00A0addition to 87,671/uni00A0shares transferred to cover the rights of beneficiaries who had exercised stock options.\n\nThe 210,000 Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA shares resulting from the exercise of the American call options, which serve to cover the various plans, were sold off-market to an investment services provider at an average price of \u20ac126.53.\n\nIn addition, the shares purchased during FY20 under the share buyback programme were cancelled. This concerns 3,545,029/uni00A0shares.\n\nUnder the liquidity agreement signed with Rothschild & Cie Banque, during the period, the Company:\n\n- purchased 475,914/uni00A0shares for a total amount of \u20ac75,094,144.55; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and\n- sold 475,914/uni00A0shares for a total amount of \u20ac75,115,628.05. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n## Distribution of treasury shares on 30/uni00A0June 2021\n\nTreasury shares are all allocated as reserves for different stock option and performance-based share allocation plans.\n\n## Details of the new share buyback programme to/uni00A0be submitted for authorisation to/uni00A0the/uni00A0Combined Shareholders' Meeting of/uni00A010/uni00A0November 2021\n\nThe description of this programme (see below), which was established in accordance with article/uni00A0241-3 of the AMF's General Regulation, will/uni00A0not be published separately.\n\nAs the authorisation granted by the Shareholders' Meeting of 27/uni00A0November2020 allowing the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares is due to expire on 26/uni00A0May 2022, a resolution will be proposed at the Shareholders' Meeting of 10/uni00A0November 2021 (12 th /uni00A0resolution - see Section/uni00A08 'Combined Shareholders' Meeting' of this universal registration document) to grant a further authorisation to the Board of Directors to trade in the Company's shares at a maximum purchase price of \u20ac280 per share, excluding acquisition costs.\n\nThis authorisation would enable the Board of Directors to purchase Company shares representing a maximum of 10% of the Company's share capital. Thus, in accordance with the law, the/uni00A0Company may not at any time hold a number of shares representing more than 10% of its share capital.",

Any shareholder wishing to attend the Shareholders' Meeting in person who has not received their admission card by 00.00 (Paris time) two/uni00A0business days before the Shareholders' Meeting may also ask for such a certificate to be issued.\n\nIf a shareholder does not attend the Shareholders' Meeting in person, he or she may choose one of the following options:\n\n- give a proxy to the Chairman of theShareholders' Meeting; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- give a proxy to a spouse or partner with whom he or she has glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> entered into a civil union agreement, or to any other person; or\n- vote by post or via the Internet. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nAshareholder who has already cast a postal or Internet vote, sent in a proxy form or applied for an admission card or a share certificate may sell all or/uni00A0some of his or her shares at any time.

Nevertheless, transfer following the division of an estate or the liquidation ofassets between spouses and inter vivos donation to a spouse or relation close enough to inherit will not result in the loss of the acquired right and will not interrupt the aforementioned ten-year period.\n\n## Declaration of statutory thresholds\n\nAny individual or corporate body acquiring a shareholding greater than 0.5% of the share capital must inform the Company of the total number of shares held by registered letter, with/uni00A0return receiptrequested, within/uni00A0a period of 15/uni00A0days from the date on which this threshold is exceeded. This notificationmust be repeated,under the same conditions, each/uni00A0time the threshold is exceeded by an additional 0.5%, up to and including 4.5%.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with the notification obligation mentioned in the previous paragraph,shares in excess of the undeclared amount shall be stripped of their voting rights, at the request, as set forthin the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting, of/uni00A0one/uni00A0or more shareholders holding at least 5% of the share capital, for/uni00A0any/uni00A0Shareholders' Meeting held until the expiry of the period stipulated inarticle/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-14 of the French Commercial Code following the date when the notification is made.\n\n## Modification of shareholders' 2.12.4 rights\n\nThe Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting has the power to modify shareholders'rights, under the conditions defined by law.",

It refers to the Board of Directors on various points when the latter's approval is required. It steers and coordinates the major transformation projects launched recently, organises the work of the Executive Committee and defines objectives for its members, in particular by signing off the strategic plan, the budget and regular business reviews.\n\nIn addition, the Group Communications Department, the Public Affairs Department and the Internal Audit Department report to the Chairman and CEO.\n\nThe Executive Board meets on a weekly basis.\n\n## Executive Committee 2.13.2\n\nThe Executive Committee comprises the Group's Management body.\n\nComposed of15 members - the entire Executive Board as well as the Chairmenand ChiefExecutive Officers of the main affiliates who meet every month (approximately 11 times a year) at the registered office or at an affiliate. Under the direction of the Chairman & CEO, the Board helps to define the Group'sstrategy and plays an essential coordinating role between the registered office and affiliates, as well as amongst the affiliates themselves (Brand Companies and Market Companies).\n\n## More specifically:\n\n- The Board is responsible for overseeing the Group's business glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> activities and ensuring that its mainpolicies are applied;\n- It gives its opinion on the setting of financial and operational glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> objectives;\n- It periodically conducts brand and market reviews, assesses glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> performance and proposes the necessary organisational adjustments; and\n- It validates the Group's major policies and oversees their glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> implementation.\n\nComposition of the Executive Committee on 30/uni00A0June 2021:\n\n- the Executive Board; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- the CEOs of the Brand Companies: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Chivas Brothers: Jean-Christophe Coutures/uni00A0 (1) , CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n- Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt: C\u00e9sar Giron, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Winemakers: Bryan Fry, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Irish Distillers Group: Conor McQuaid, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- The Absolut Company: St\u00e9phanie Durroux, CEO; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- the CEOs of the Market Companies: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard North America: Ann Mukherjee, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Asia: Philippe Guettat, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> America: Gilles/uni00A0Bogaert, CEO,\n- Pernod Ricard Global Travel Retail: Mohit Lal, CEO, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod Ricard France: Philippe Coutin, CEO. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n## Non-discrimination policy 2.13.3 and/uni00A0diversity in/uni00A0Top Management\n\nThe policy is based on talent identificationand management processes, as well as succession planning focused on performance and potential. Considerable effort has been made in recent years to ensure the quality and objectivity of the assessment.This resulted in the implementation last year of the 'Let's Talk Talent'assessment and calibration process powered by the Workday platform, deployed globally,and/uni00A0which ensures the greatest possible consistency in the personal development and career advancement process for all our employees.\n\nIn addition, in the wake of the global 'BetterBalance' initiative conducted from 2017 to 2019 on the two main dimensions of the Group's diversity challenges (gender and nationality), the General Management and the Human Resources Department have been encouraged to identify measures specific to their own diversity challenges on at least these two dimensions and to make them objectives for the members of the affiliates' Management Committees. Moreover, objectives have been defined for the Group's Management bodies, identified as the 'Top 500'/uni00A0 (2) employees, and a series of actions have been taken to help achieve these objectives/uni00A0 (3) .\n\nIn 2019, Pernod Ricard's Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Nominations and Governance Committee, established binding objectives within its CSR roadmap relating to diversity in the Group's management bodies: by 2030, the Group's management bodies will have to include a/uni00A0minimum of 40% women/men representation. In addition, Pernod Ricard estimates that it will achieve a 30% gender balance in its management bodies by 2025.\n\nAll of the initiatives undertaken by Pernod Ricard in favour of diversity help to make all the processes that lead to the selection of candidates and their assignment to the highest positions of responsibility in the Company more equitable and have produced the following results over the recent period:\n\n- for the Executive Committee, the proportion of women has glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> increased from 7% to 27% between2015 and 2021; and\n- for the 'Top 500', between2015 and 2021, the proportion glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of/uni00A0womenhas risenfrom19% to 29%.\n\nThis diversity policy and the results obtained are presented annually to the Board of Directors by General Management.",

We partner with local farmers and respect local communities to benefit our planet, our/uni00A0consumers and business.\n\nWe bring Good Times from a Good Place, to create a more convivial world, a world without excess.'\n\n## Addressing stakeholder expectations 3.1.1.2 across the business, from grain to glass\n\nIn line with the Pernod Ricard consumer-centric model, the Group's Sustainability & Responsibility strategy is centred around a robust framework with four pillars: Nurturing Terroir, Valuing People, Circular Making and Responsible Hosting. All of these directly support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to help achieve prosperity for the planet and its people. Since 2018, the Group has LEAD/uni00A0status for its work with the UN Global Compact - recognising its high engagement in this organisation and strong efforts to implement the SDGs.\n\nEach pillar includes ambitious targets for 2030 designed to drive innovation, brand differentiation and talent attraction. All pillars are based on a 2030 timeline with 2022 and 2025 milestones, in line with the schedule set out by the SDGs.\n\nThe strategy primarily contributes to eight UN SDGs while also impacting and addressing 14 SDGs across its value chain.\n\nPernod Ricard's Sustainability & Responsibility strategy was built on the material risks of its business, consumer concerns and the world's agenda. The strategy is the result of a long process from qualitative interviews to the consultation of over 300 internal and external stakeholders globally and external experts. Over 20/uni00A0workshops were held with representatives from Brand Companies, Market Companies, Regions, HQ and the Top Management team. This all fed into ambitious targets that were set according to where Pernod Ricard could have the greatest impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Alcohol can be part of a balanced lifestyle and Pernod Ricard is strongly committed to promoting responsible consumption with its employees and consumers.\n\nThese scenario insights have been reviewed by Pernod Ricard's S&R Strategic Committee and S&R Committee at Board level and will be incorporated into Pernod Ricard's strategy and risk management.The overall analysis found that the S&Rstrategy would remainrelevant and robust across scenarios, though some themes may need to be emphasised or shifted.\n\n## Arobust governance structure 3.1.2\n\nThe Sustainability & Responsibility strategy is implemented throughout the Group with the following Governance structure:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Statement requires the Group to publish its business model and information on key non-financial risks.These include risks related to the environment, employment, society,human rights, tax evasion (pursuant to Act no./uni00A02018-898 on combatting fraud) and corruption. For more information on Pernod Ricard's business model, please refer to Section/uni00A01 'Extracts from the integrated annual report' and for more information on the Group's key non-financial risks please see subsections/uni00A03.2.1 and 3.2.2 below.\n\n## Presentation of the methodology 3.2.1\n\nPernod Ricard adopted the following methodology:\n\n- every three years, the mainrisks faced by Pernod Ricard are glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> mapped by direct affiliates and HQ functions and then consolidated at HQ level by the Group's Internal Audit Department. Updated in FY21, the/uni00A0Group's risk mapping presents and classifies the risks according to their potential impact and occurrence across the Group's activities. Some of these risks are specific to sustainability issues. The/uni00A0Group's major risks and the process for identifying them are discussed in section/uni00A04 of this document;\n- the same Group'srisk mapping methodology and tool is used glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> to identify the main sustainability risks for the 'Non-Financial Statement';\n- led by the Sustainability & Responsibility Department, these glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> sustainability risks are subject to in-depth analysis through research, competitive benchmarking and internal and external stakeholder dialogue (see subsection/uni00A03.1.1.2 'Addressing stakeholder expectations across the entire business, from grain to glass'); and the Group's materiality matrix last updated in 2020. Otherkey HQ experts including operations, legal, HR, public affairs and finance were also involved to confirm the top eight risks and opportunities;\n- the identified sustainability risks and opportunities are then glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> cross-referenced with the 2021 Group Risk Mapping to confirm and ensure consistency with the Group'smajor risks in Section/uni00A04;\n- the resulting eight non-financial risksand opportunities were glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> subsequently presented to and signed off by the S&R Senior Steering Committee and the S&R Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Theeight risks and opportunities identified 3.2.2\n\nThe definitions of the eight main risks and opportunities can be found in the table below. Targets, policies, due diligence procedures, and key performance indicators are presented in detail in subsections/uni00A03.3 'The/uni00A0four pillars of the Good Times from a Good Place Roadmap' and 3.4 'Ethics and compliance'. In the interest of transparency, other/uni00A0indicators have been presented alongside the policies applied, depending on the issues addressed.\n\nGiven the nature of our activities, we consider that the 'tax evasion' referred to in article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-102-1 of French Commercial Code does not constitute a major non-financial risk for the Group. It was therefore not felt necessary to explore it in this 'Non-Financial Statement'. Nevertheless, 'tax evasion' is discussed in subsection/uni00A03.4.1.4 'Tax/uni00A0policy'.",

Pernod Ricard is therefore responsible for supporting and promoting sustainable agriculture practices with three objectives:\n\n- to conserve ecosystems and natural capital, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> wild or cultivated, by preserving habitats and\n\ntrophic chains;\n\n- to tackle climate change, by reducing its greenhouse gas glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> emissions, and exploring potential carbon sinks within its agricultural chains, as well as adapting the choice of its crops and agricultural practices;\n- to support agricultural communities and smallholders, in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> order to develop practices, improve livelihoods, access to health and education and more generally, the economic empowerment of these local populations.\n\n## Support communities to regenerate 3.3.1.1 ecosystems and tackle climate change\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nThe Group's core business is inextricably linked to well-functioning ecosystems. Any disruption to one component (soil, water, climate, landscape\u2026) has a direct impact on natural balances. Pernod Ricard is therefore very attentive to each element in order to better understand the mechanisms at work and restore the natural balances.\n\nThe Group believes in the strength of a holistic and systemic approach to agriculture that covers the entire farming system, maximises the shared benefits and, ultimately, the overall resilience of the terroirs over the long term:\n\n- maximising positive interactions betweenagricultural and wild glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> ecosystems;\n- paying particular attention to soil life and its ability to restore glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> carboncycles;\n- reducing dependency on agrochemicals; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- managing water resources sustainably; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- taking care of the peoplewho work the land every day. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>",

This global approach looks at the system as a whole in order to enrich soil life and its natural fertility, improve waterretention capacity,and protect and enhance biodiversity. In the long term, regenerative agriculture improves the vitality of plants, maximises carbon storage in the soil, ensures a high-quality harvest and stabilises yields. The terroirs will thereby be more resilient in the face of the effects of climate change, and will achieve a sustainable improvement in the livelihoodsof farming communities.\n\nDuring FY20 Pernod Ricard defined its Sustainable Agriculture Key Principles. This document presents a set of best practices related to landscape management, biodiversity, plant health and soil life, water, human rights and relations with suppliers.\n\nThus, the Group intends to gradually move away from conventional models to reduce the various pressures on resources (for example, by implementing alternative practices that avoid the use of synthetic inputs) and promoteregenerative agricultural models. This reference document covers all the different contexts and agricultural systems in order to engage in a continuous improvement process.\n\n## Pernod Ricard's agricultural footprint 3.3.1.2\n\nA terroir represents the origin of a culture in particular and has unique characteristics in terms of climatic conditions, type of soil, ecosystems and the know-how of the people and communities whoworkandlive there.\n\nForPernod Ricard, this means nearly 350 terroirs rooted in/uni00A066 countries around the world.The total amount of/uni00A0agricultural raw material used is around 2.7/uni00A0million tons madeup of:\n\n- a variety of grain (wheat, barley, rye,maize, rice, sorghum); glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- sugar cane, agave, and sugar beet; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- flavouring ingredients with a specific attention to nine of them, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> which are considered as iconic for the Group's brands (coffee, coconut, fennel, star anise, licorice, juniper, coriander, gentian and orange);\n- 17/uni00A0wine-growing countries, eight of which have vineyards glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> directly operated by Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe total footprint of these terroirs is estimated at around 324,700/uni00A0hectares.\n\nSomeof these terroirs are directly operated by Pernod Ricard:\n\n- 5,631/uni00A0hectares are dedicated to vineyards in seven different glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> countries: New Zealand (45%); Australia (24%); France (12.5%); Argentina (8.5%); Spain (5.6%); United States (2.5%); China (1.9%);\n- 990/uni00A0hectares are dedicated to agave crops in Mexico. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nThe environmental footprints of our vineyards are monitored and analysed each year in order to optimise practices and minimise the pressure on resources. These elements are no longer communicated as of this year, although they are still monitored and analysed, because, in line with our strategy, we are working on a new and more systemic indicator which will aim to reflect the level of regeneration of these vineyards. Moreover, because they represent less than 3% of the total surface area used to produce the agricultural raw materials necessary for the Group's needs, these impacts can be considered as relatively minor.\n\n## BREAKDOWNOFAGRICULTURALRAWMATERIALS (TONNES)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaize\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nIn order to manage risks within agricultural supply chains, address the duty of care, and achieve our nurturing terroir ambition, the Group has implemented a strategy divided into three levels (Figure/uni00A02). The aims are : to map the different terroirs to reach full traceability, to assess environmental and social risks that may be present on these terroirs, and finally implement eventually sustainability programmes.",

In order to select the best standards, in line with the Sustainable Agriculture Key Principles, the Group has developed a benchmarking tool.The Group also gives its subsidiaries the opportunity to develop their own standards with their local partners. All must then be certified by third parties.\n\nThe standards are chosen to cover most of the high and medium risks identified through the terroir risk mapping analysis. For example, given the risk profiles for the different sugar cane terroirs, the Bonsucro certification has been identified as the most suitable and will be deployed to all our suppliers.\n\nThis approach was designed to adapt to each terroir by taking into consideration local cultures, work habits as well as the potential for transforming practices.\n\n## RISK MITIGATION PROJECTS\n\nFor each priority terroir, Pernod Ricard is committed to mitigating the negative effects of practices by setting up innovative projects, by implementing new technologies or training farmers on alternative practices.\n\n## FOCUS ON THE WATER FOOTPRINT OF VINEYARDS\n\nAs perennial crops, vineyardsare particularly sensitive to the effects of climate changeand in particular droughts, fires or even frost. The increased frequency and severity of such events is a trend that has been confirmed over the past three years in our vineyards. Despite the use of precision farming tools like drip irrigation systems, we are seeing an increase in our water consumption, which amounts to 12.5/uni00A0million m 3 this year. Improving the resilience of vines in the face of water scarcity will beat the heart of pilot programmes on regenerative viticulture.\n\n## FOCUS ON THE AGRICULTURAL CARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nThe carbon footprint ofagricultural raw materials represents 32% of the Group's scope/uni00A03 (see subsection/uni00A03.3.3.2 'Climate/uni00A0change: reduction and adaptation'). It is therefore essential to define robust calculation methodologies and share them with the different terroirs. FY21 was dedicated to identifying the raw materials that emit the most GreenHouse Gas (GHG), then defining calculation methodologies specific to each category. Thus, a methodology for calculating GHG emissions for cereals was designed in collaboration with the affiliates and supported by external expertise. Depending on the weight of the material in the overall footprint of agricultural products, Pernod Ricard will assign a generic, semi-specific or specific emission factor.\n\nSubsequently,significant work will be carried out in partnership withits strategic suppliers to reduce these emissions, either by adapting agricultural practices (crop fertilisation for instance) or by upgrading industrial processes.",

For example, transitioning to regenerative practices for large industrial corn farmers in the USA will require different support and milestones than a transition for small Indian rice farmers.\n\nThe programmes aim to better understand and take into account local contexts, measure the dynamics of natural cycles, train partners in regenerative practices and design continuous improvement plans over the long term.\n\nTo support this journey on priority terroirs, Pernod Ricard decided to join the French movement PADV ( Pour une Agriculture Du Vivant ). t Thanks to the regeneration index they have developed, the Group measured the starting point of its partner farms and then put in place levers to improve the resilience of the terroirs.\n\nFor its own vineyards, the Group commits to set up regenerative viticulture pilot programmes within its own vineyards.\n\nFollowing a complete diagnosis of the two French terroirs, Martell cognac and Mumm and Perrier-Jou\u00ebt champagnes, set up a pilot programme to explore three mainareas: soil life, plant health and nutrition, and landscape management. Various trials are implemented to test combinations of cover-crops, develop grape varieties resistant to climate constraints, or even implement specific technologies or machines.\n\nIn the south of France, where Irish Distillers source their maize, the Group has enrolled with 27/uni00A0farmers in the regenerative index measurement to identify their areas of progress and transform their practices, such as no or low tillage. During this project, the Group is also working to develop a fair economic model to ensure long term mutual commitments.\n\nIn India, Pernod Ricard India Foundation's flagship programme WAL (Water, Agriculture, Livelihoods) aims to foster water resilience, promote sustainable and regenerative resource management while securing the livelihoods of disadvantaged communities such as smallholder farmers, women and young people.\n\nIn Mexico, Kahl\u00faa works with coffee-producing communities and withlocal NGO Fondo Para La Paz to support agricultural practices like the planting and development of climate change resistant varieties as well as fair remuneration, with a specific focus on women empowerment.\n\nIn the/uni00A0Philippines, Malibu works with 500 coconut farmers to increase yields, improve access to waterand sanitation, provide training and/uni00A0technical/uni00A0support, support young people and children to prevent/uni00A0migration/uni00A0for work and improve the whole livelihood of the community.",

The Group promotes diversity and inclusion throughout its business. It works with its suppliers to create shared values in its supply chain.\n\nThis pillar is all about respect: for everyone the Group works with across its supply chain and for its 18,011/uni00A0employees (FY21/uni00A0average) worldwide. This means increasing employee loyalty and engagement, lowering supply chain risks and meeting rising consumer expectations around transparency. Due to the seasonal nature of its activities, especially during harvest periods, 4.4% of the annual average headcount is on fixed-term contracts. Rather than using contractors, Pernod Ricard prefers to hire this temporary workforce so that they can also benefit from its development and health & safety policies.\n\n## Talent management 3.3.2.1\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Progress in FY20                                                                                                    | Progress in FY21                                                                                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | Pernod Ricard is committed glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> to/uni00A0developing the employability of/uni00A0all its employees throughout their working lives.

Itwill also help them drive change while being aligned with the Group strategy.\n\nThe leadership attributes represent the leadership behaviour Pernod Ricard needs to ensure its future success.They have become embedded in Global Talent Management practices through the annual year-end review process, 360 feedback process, assessment centres and leadership development programmes.",

This/uni00A0set the goal of making Convivialit\u00e9 a true performance driver by:\n\n- putting the employee experience at the core; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- deploying diverse teams to improve both individual and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> collective performance; and\n- introducing a culture of performance and success based on glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> empowerment and accountability, all supported by digital technology.\n\n## Actions plans and next steps\n\n## WORKDAYHRMANAGEMENTSYSTEM\n\nTwo years ago, the Group introduced and started benefiting from the new employee-centric tool, Workday, to manage the key group HR processes with great success.Pernod Ricard has been able to measure the value of the investment done having streamlined business processes, set/uni00A0a/uni00A0common language, created unified and reliable information worldwide. It has significantly improved HR efficiency, facilitating decision-making to have the right talents in the right position with therightskills at theright time of their career.\n\nEmployees and Managers, at/uni00A0the core of Workday and the HR Strategy more broadly, now have the perfect tool to access information about their position, career path, compensation, and evaluation at any time, from any place. They are fully empowered to promote themselves and be proactive with their career development.\n\nWith the acquired experience since Workday launch, and the improved efficiency, Pernod Ricard is now committed to the continued improvement of employees' experience by introducing additional functionalities that improve employees and managers interaction and dialogue. The Group continued to analyse and revisit on regular basis what has been done using agileways of working, 'Test, Learn and Optimise'.\n\nThe Group further strengthened the annual year-end performance and merit process through the full integration of these in Workday.In addition to the deployments across affiliates of the new functionalities likethe Training module, or thesystem for monitoring Absence and Time Tracking, the Group continued to leverage the technology for more efficiency, transparency,planning and forecasting accuracy in HR. This was achieved in a very agile and collaborative mode with the development and implementation of the Adaptive Insightmodule in Workday. A strategic project for Pernod Ricard, launched simultaneously in all Group affiliates and the one that allows HR to forecast, plan and manage employees related costs, which represent the biggest part inthe total Structure Costs.\n\nClearly understanding the importance of adoption, embedding and proficiency in new ways of working, in 2021 Pernod Ricard continued in a consistent and coherent manner to enhance the process efficiency and HR population capabilities through a strong change management plan with a massive upskilling effort within, which was delivered to HR community through 184 e-learnings and toolkits, and 95 training and Q&A sessions. This ambitious initiative will ensure that HR effectively embeds the new ways of working, and pro-actively partners and supports managers & employees to co-create their unique experience at Pernod Ricard.\n\n## 'LET'S TALK TALENT' OUR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT &/uni00A0DEVELOPMENT PLANNING PROCESS\n\nPernod Ricard employees and their performance are the foundation of the Company's success. Building on the process launched last year 'Let's Talk Talent', the assessment of the 'how' has been implemented in the performance process through the annual performance review.How you do thingsis as important as what you do. Employees are evaluated not only on what they achieved but also on how they achieved it through the leadership attributes. Let's Talk Talent is intended to provide a systematic process, which is comprehensive, fair, and developmentally focused. It/uni00A0enables/uni00A0Pernod Ricard to identify skillsand competencies required tosupport its strategic plans and encourages a diverse high performing culture. This/uni00A0process, together with the assessment of individuals' potential to grow through their Learning Agility, forms the basis for identifying and developing talents in theorganisation for career development and succession planning. Last year 76% of employees participated in the Let's Talk Talent process.\n\nTo achieve this, employees are taking ownership of their career development. For development to make an impact, employees must be clear on what skill or behaviour needs to be improved and express a willingness to be challenged. An important mind-set shift has been supported to build a culture of feedback encouraged between Manager and employee throughout the year.\n\nPernod Ricard offers employees resources that provide them with development ideas so that they are empowered to develop their career.\n\n## PERNOD RICARD UNIVERSITY\n\nPernod Ricard University actively partners with the business and HR Departments to identify Learning & Development needs and then design programmes withhigh-end institutions, consultants, and internal experts. Pernod Ricard learning offer is based on co-creation, blended learning, dynamic sessions built on the 70/20/10 approach to upskill teams and employees, which this year trained 98% of employees.\n\nL&D programmes are rolled out and delivered online, locally or at the historical Domaine de La Voisine near Paris, a place acquired by Paul Ricard in 1957, and transformed into a state-of-the-art campus in 2017. The site is again operational after the lock-down and is welcoming learners from both Pernod Ricard and other leading companies. Participants there find themselves in a cohort comprising colleagues from different parts of the world with different backgrounds and from different cultures.As Responsible Hosts we create special moments for all the learners, ones that enrich them professionally and personally and thus we share our values and culture and create that special bond which ties the group together and which Pernod Ricard calls 'convivialit\u00e9'.\n\nIn 2021, the key priority was the massive upskilling in digital,: Pernod Ricard co-developed and launched the 'D-Passport' - a Group-wide programme aimed at growing the knowledgeand skills in digital, AgileWays of Working and a Platform business model. The programme targeted to support the digital upskilling of Marketing, Commercial and Leadership teams. 5,898/uni00A0employees were trained in a fully remote mode, based on customised leaning path, including series of micro-learnings, webinars, external speakers, quizzes, and tests.",

In 2021, a total of 80 participants have attended Blenders, dedicated to Top Management to assess them against the newly Group Leadership Model. Theobjective is to reflect theskills and behaviours expected to lead teams and to provide participants with a benchmark for their professional development withIndividualised Development Plans based on each person's needs.\n\nIn parallel, the Group continues to deliver key development programmes with Shakers for confirmed leaders and Mixers, for young aspiring leaders willing to be taken outside their comfort zone. Since the implementation of these programs, 229 participants have benefitted from 'Shakers' programmes and 652from 'Mixers' programmes.\n\nThe Group has also built Leadership Assessment and Development Centres, through an external provider, to assess capabilities and leadership potential, to identify strengths and competencies, to empower high potential individuals, and to better prepare themfor future leadership roles.The goal is to encourageindividual ownership of careers by all employees. The LeAD UP programme offers two-day sessions at which participants do individual interviews and case studies.They also receive an extensive feedback session and a participation to workshops.

Seen as a source of richness and a real performance driverfor the Company, Pernod Ricard has made diversity a focus for its leaders through the 'Better Balance for Better Business' initiative. This programme aims to raise awareness on the value of diversity throughout the business with a focus on gender and nationality and laid the foundation to address any\n\nother dimension of diversity,as may be relevant in the various partsof the Group. Major global targets were set following the campaign and became part of the 2030 S&R roadmap.\n\nSince the start of the Better Balance journey in 2015, Pernod Ricard increased the percentage of women in Top Management from 19% to 29%. And to move the needle even further, not just in terms of gender, but all aspects of diversity, the group have designed a new roadmap, \"BetterBalance:Inclusive Diversity\".",

Between2015 and 2021, the proportion of women in the Group 'Top 500' rose from 19% to 29%.\n\nThe new HR Strategy, TransfoHRm, announced in 2018, is an inherently diversity-friendly strategy. TransfoHRm looked at ensuring that key processes like talent development and management are fair and equitable, supported by Workday, the/uni00A0Group HRIS global platform. Let's Talk Talent is a consistent process, based on an objective assessment of performance and potential, which/uni00A0gives all employees equal chances to develop a successfuland fulfilling career at Pernod Ricard. With the 'How' of performance now as important as its 'What', with Managers better trained in performance evaluationand calibration, the process is designed to overcome the traditional pitfalls of talent management to make Pernod Ricard more open to diversity & inclusion.\n\nThe Group has also become more visible on the Diversity challenge with an active participation in the main event of the last three editions of the Women's Forum in Paris (10 delegates, participation to the CEOs' workshop and event sponsorship).\n\nFinally, at the end of FY20, the Group Global Talent Management Director formally took on the additional responsibilities of diversity & inclusion to shift the focus of 'Better Balance for BetterBusiness' from the creation of more diversity to focusing on inclusion as a catalyst to accelerate Pernod Ricard performance.\n\nRegarding gender pay gap, the Company has delivered the second edition of the pay gap global project, partnering with an external independent specialist. This global initiative has entailed\n\nan audit of over 70/uni00A0countries. The objective is to identify the behavioural drivers and roots of pay gaps betweenmale and female employees to ensure strict pay equity across the Group by providing a long-term systematic compensation review. Results for FY21 are showing great progress with a 1.8% gap worldwide, taking into consideration that 1% is not considered as a gap by external providers.\n\nThe Group strives to attract and recruit young peoplethrough different types of contracts (apprenticeships, training, etc.).The Group also recruits and develops young graduates through/uni00A0VIE (international volunteers in business) and international young graduate programmes. These include the JamesonInternational Graduate Programme, Pernod Ricard Asia Regional Management Trainee Programme and the Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Ambassadors programme. Furthermore, Pernod Ricard University supports the work of the Youth Action Council (YAC)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nRegarding disability, affiliates comply with local legal requirements and efforts are made to improve the incorporation of workers with disabilities. In FY21, 55 affiliates worked on adapting premises and investing in appropriate equipment, providing training, and raising employee awareness, conducting joint projects with specialised establishments, participating in dedicated forums, recruiting workers with disabilities, etc.\n\nTwenty years ago, Pernod Ricard also signed up to the Business Workplace Diversity Charter, which aims to encourage the employment of different members of French society. This Charter bans all forms of discrimination in recruitment, training, and professional development.",

In the managerial population, the proportion of women has been constantly increasing over the last decade - from 30% in FY12 to 43% in FY21.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF POSITIONS WITH PERMANENT CONTRACTS FILLED BY WOMEN\n\n| Number and %       | FY20      | FY21      |\n|--------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Internal transfers | 314 (55%) | 657 (45%) |\n| External hires     | 903 (44%) | 817 (46%) |\n\n## Employee engagement & culture, working conditions and health & safety 3.3.2.3\n\n## Employee engagement & culture\n\nSince it started to measure it, the Group has had a very high level of employee engagement.\n\nThe Global Employee Engagement Survey, 'I Say,' has been reinvented and in partnership with Glint, Pernod Ricard will be deploying the 6 th /uni00A0edition of 'I Say' in September/uni00A02021. The revised survey will empower managers and HR to leverage advanced analytics and insights to better understand employee's needs. It has been improved with a more simplified structure that is supported by a digital platform which managers and HR will be able to access and extract results, being able to build targeted actionplans. The results will be benchmarked against engagement data from external organisations.\n\n| Number and %                                 | FY17   | FY19   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employees that completed the 'iSay' Survey** | 88%    | 85%    |\n| Engagement rate ('iSay')**                   | 88%    | 88%    |\n\n| Number and %                  | FY20   | FY21   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total departure rate* (1)     | 14%    | 14.6%  |\n| Number of resignations*       | 1,220  | 1,106  |\n| Voluntary departure rate* (2) | 6.8%   | 6.4%   |\n| Absenteeism rate**            | 3.9%   | 4.1%   |\n\n## Welfare, social protection and labour relations\n\n## POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES\n\n## Compensation policy\n\nThe compensation policy reflects the decentralised business model, except for Group Senior Management, whose compensation is overseen by Headquarters. Each affiliate manages its policy locally while upholding a set of common rules. These include developing a performance culture and offering compensation that is competitive locally, leveraging external benchmarking and compensation data. This also involves setting up straightforward, meaningful, and motivating compensation packages.\n\nTotal payroll is included in Note/uni00A03.5 Expenses by type to section/uni00A06 'Consolidated financial statements' . This year, payroll represented 13.8% of net sales.\n\n## Signature of labour agreements\n\nEach year, the affiliates sign roughly150 agreements with the various social partners worldwide, thereby encouraging improved social dialogue. The number of agreements signed depends on changes to local legislation.\n\nThe agreements signed by affiliates during the past year mainly covered compensation and profit-sharing, group welfare schemes, remote working and occupational health and safety.",

The total gross amount paid under profit-sharing and incentive plans to over 5,078/uni00A0employees amounted to nearly \u20ac34/uni00A0million. This was matched by contributions (additional sum paid to employees forinvestments in the Company savings plan) amounting to over \u20ac3/uni00A0million. Moreover, long-term profit-sharing policies (such/uni00A0as/uni00A0allocating performance-based shares) have once again been implemented in FY21for over 750/uni00A0employees worldwide.\n\nIn 2019,the Group launched Accelerate, its very first Employee Share Ownership Plan. This first version of the Plan has been rolled out in 18/uni00A0countries, covering 75% of Group employees. The initiative proved highly successful, with an overall subscription rateof41.5%. Such a level is rarely achieved when structured offerings are launched.Thesubscription rate exceeded 60% in several countries, such as India (76.4%) and Hong Kong (60.4%). In/uni00A0France, the/uni00A0subscription rate was 56.9%.\n\nIn 2021, the Group is launching the new policy Pay for Performance, to link directly bonuses to the performance and reward theextra performance, allowing differentiation. This will support driving a stronger high-performance culture across the organisation, allowing managers to differentiate the reward and recognition of their teams based on their contribution and performance both on the'what' and the'how'.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\n## Welfare protection and health insurance\n\nIn accordance with the Group's commitment, all employees are offered a welfare protection plan covering major risks (death and invalidity). Some chose not to be covered or are covered by their spouse's employer.\n\n## Social dialogue\n\nThe Group has a long tradition of social dialogue and promotes freedom of associationin all the countries in which it operates. In/uni00A0addition, it firmly believes in the importance of providing a working environment with optimal working conditions:\n\n- European Works Council : with over 50% of its staff based in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Europe, the Group has mainly focused its efforts on European employee representatives, through the European Works Council. This council brings together one or more representatives from every affiliate within the EU with over 50/uni00A0people. It had a total of 24 seats for representatives inFY21. The European Works Council meets at least once a year. A Select Committee, elected by their peers, comprising five members from five different countries, meets at least once a year too. The Select Committee mayact on its own initiative in response to any social measure that might be taken in Europe involving at least two countries in which Pernod Ricard has local teams.\n\nTo share information, an Intranet site publishes content each year co-written by delegates and the HR Department.\n\nThe France Group Committee meets once a year. It brings together employee representatives appointed by the largest tradeunions in the French affiliates. At these meetings, the Group's business activities are reviewed, together with an analysis of employment trendsand forecast changes during the year ahead.\n\nThe Group Committee and the European Works Council are chaired by the Group Chairman & CEO, Alexandre Ricard, and moderated by the HR Department;\n\n- The Global Deal : Pernod Ricard has officially signed up to the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Global Deal, a multi-stakeholder partnership intended to address challenges in theglobal labour market and enable everyone to benefit from globalisation. It aims to encourage governments, businesses, unions/uni00A0and other organisations to make commitments to enhance social dialogue and promote joint solutions.

SUSTAINABILITY & RESPONSIBILITY\n\nLaunched in 2019 this ambition was structured into a Global Health & Safety Policy called 'Taking Care of Each Other'.\n\nThe strategicpriorities to achieve Pernod Ricard's goal are to:\n\n- develop a Culture where safety is at the heart of Convivialit\u00e9; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- develop leadership through engagement, motivation and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> empowerment;\n- improve business performance through excellence in Health glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> &Safety.\n\nThis policy has been approved by Pernod Ricard's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and its Executive Committee. It has been presented to the Board of Directors. The Executive Vice President, Human Resources, Sustainability & Responsibility oversees the implementation of the Group'sHealth & Safety Policy. Affiliate Vice Presidents, and each Management Director at local level are in charge of implementing the Pernod Ricard Global Health & Safety Policy.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nAchieving this goal requires management systems. In that respect, the Group's production sites are required to be OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certified. In addition, Pernod Ricard is also committed to and actively works on a health &safety culture in which everyone is involved in taking care of each otherthrough a culture of interdependence.\n\nTo drive this change, audits conducted by a third party focusing on safety culture and performance are being rolled out across the major production sites. Each audit results in an assessment of the maturity of the site, and in action plan aiming at reaching the next level on the maturity scale.\n\nAnother key action launched in FY21 is the Pernod Ricard training programme 'Care by Learning', where more than a hundred Safety Champions from affiliates have been trained in order to become the new trainers for the local teams and roll-out the new safety culture. In terms of high-risk activity, a strong focus was put in FY21 on material handling equipment, that can cause a risk of collision for pedestrians. All affiliates have implemented prevention measures following an assessment of their local practices.\n\nA new Operating Requirement 'Key Health &Safety Principles' has been implemented during FY21. All the non-industrial affiliates performed a gap analysis and must complete their mitigation action plans by the end ofFY21, in order to meet all minimumrequirements.\n\nIn FY22 the implementation of the roadmap will be accelerated with the roll-out ofanew IT platform to manage safety incidents across the whole Group, the extension of the safety culture audits and with the global cascade of the Care by Learning programme to local teams.\n\nA Safety Leadership Programme will be developed and rolled out across the group in FY22, aimed at raising the level of H&S culture through engagement, motivation, and empowerment.\n\nNote: all these actions are covering both Pernod Ricard employees as well as the contractors under direct supervision.\n\nAs a resultof this global effort, the accident frequency rate was reduced by 32% over the last financial year, a significant achievement in line with the Health & Safety Roadmap objective.\n\n## KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS\n\n| Workplace accidents and % of sites certified             | FY20   | FY21   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of workplace accidents with lost time/uni00A0 (1) | 106    | 68     |\n| Frequency rate/uni00A0 (1) (2)                           | 5.3    | 3.6    |\n| Severity rate (1) (3)                                    | 165    | 143    |\n| Number of fatalities/uni00A0 (1)                         | 0      | 0      |\n| % of production sites OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001 certified    | 91%    | 91%    |\n\n## HumanRights 3.3.2.4\n\nOperating in over 73/uni00A0countries and mindful of the new challenges caused by globalisation, Pernod Ricard values its employees, suppliers and communities. It also recognises that it is its responsibility and ethical duty to ensure Human Rights are respected across the Group's global operations and value chain. This implies adhering to internationally recognised standards and addressing gaps.\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2025, align with the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGPs) on Human Rights including due diligence glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> across the Group's operations and strengthening our responsible procurement processes. |",

        "page_content": "Developed with numerous internal stakeholders, Pernod Ricard introduced its first Global Human Rights Policy in FY19 which is divided into three key sections: 'in our own operations', 'in the supply chain' and 'in our local communities'. The Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct, updated in FY19, now includes Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Supplier Standards has been updated in FY19 with additional commitments on this front.\n\nThe Executive Vice President, Human Resources, Sustainability & Responsibility oversees the implementation of the Group's HumanRights Policy. HR Directors and each Managing Director at local level are in charge of implementing the Pernod Ricard Global Human Rights Policy. As a decentralised organisation, Pernod Ricard gives responsibility to its affiliates for adopting, respecting and promoting the policy. Visits to affiliates by cross-functional internal audit teams include some labour evaluation. Managing Directors' performance evaluations cover labour matters as well as societal and financial performance. Any/uni00A0targets are specific to each affiliate.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nIn FY18, Pernod Ricard joined the UN Global Compact's Decent Work in Global Supply Chains Action platform, an alliance of companies committed to respecting Human Rights and fundamental principles and rights at work. This involves working through their supply chains and taking collective action to address decent work.\n\nIn FY19, a study based on theUNGPs and Human Rights was conducted on the Group's supply chain to identify gaps and improve its due diligence on Human Rights over the long term.\n\nInFY21, to embed a UNGPs approach, Pernod Ricard launched an assessment questionnaire with its HR network in line with its Human Rights policy and focusing on its own employees and internal practices. In addition, an external/uni00A0country level screening and mapping of potential/uni00A0Human Rights riskswas conducted. With these two tools, the goal was to help affiliates raise awareness, identify gaps in relation to the eight commitments towardsthe Group's employees in the Human Right policy and develop appropriate action plans. Overall, the findings demonstrated a number of good practices implemented. The findings also pointed to the need for increased communication and best practice sharing of our Health & Safety and Diversity & Inclusion efforts and roadmaps and better dissemination of/uni00A0the Group's Human Rights policy and whistleblowing tool, Speak-Up. The top priorities identified by affiliates were Health & Safety and Discrimination, Diversity & Inclusion demonstrating alignment with the increased efforts by the Group in developing roadmaps in these areas. For more information, refer to sections/uni00A03.3.2.2 \"Diversity & Inclusion\" and 3.3.2.3 \"Employee engagement & culture, working conditions and health & safety\". InFY22, the Group intendsto extend its impact assessment beyond its own operations, covering the wholevalue chain to identify salient Human Rights issues and prioritize action. It will also explore other areas such as capacity building.\n\n## Responsible supply chain 3.3.2.5\n\nDue to the wide range of its procurement and supplies, Pernod Ricard relies on many suppliers across its supply chain. From farming and manufacturing through distributionand merchandising, some of the Group's impact on society and the environment is managed by its suppliers. Pernod Ricard believes in creating strong business relationshipsand encourages suppliers to improve their practices and assists them in doing so.\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2025, Pernod Ricard commits to implementing all mitigation plans with/uni00A0high or medium supplier risks (1) . glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> |\n\n## Agricultural products supply\n\nSee subsection/uni00A03.3.1 'Nurturing Terroir'.\n\n## Product & services supply\n\n- Have precise knowledge of the sustainability impacts, supply glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> chain risks, and engagePernod Ricard key suppliers through collaboration to reduce impact and accelerate improvements.\n- Expand ResponsibleProcurement and Due Diligence process glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> across supply chain with a focus on critical suppliers (high risk and spend).\n\nPernod Ricard's responsible procurement actions are driven by the following main policies:\n\n- Responsible Procurement Policy, covering all purchases of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> products and services made by the entire workforce.

Each affiliate selects and monitors its suppliers and subcontractors identified as risky, and is therefore responsiblefor its application.\n\n## ACTION PLANS AND NEXT STEPS\n\nImplemented throughout the Group,the Blue Source process allows affiliates to apply the Responsible Procurement strategy locally with their suppliers and subcontractors:\n\n- Supplier Standards: to be signed by all suppliers on the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Partner Up platform with the aim of increasing awareness around Human Rights and labour law, health & safety, environmental impact, responsible drinking, integrity and fair business practices. This/uni00A0document has been updated in 2019 and includes commitments such as 'Respect Land and water rights of communities', 'Environmental regulation', 'Animal welfare'and 'Tax evasion'. Moreover, the Group took this opportunity to raise awareness among its suppliers and invite them to do the same.Both/uni00A0direct suppliers (Wet and Dry Goods) and the main indirect suppliers (POS/VAPs) who do\n\nnot sign the updated version will see their business relations with Pernod Ricard suspended;\n\n- risk mapping tool for each affiliate to identify which suppliers glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> (Wet/uni00A0and Dry Goods, POS/VAPs) and subcontractors should be assessed first according to set criteria regarding the Company: production or service, size, country footprint, net sales, dependence of the supplier on the affiliate, annual expenditure, critical nature of the product, social, environmental and supply chain risks of the supplier;\n- sustainability assessment using the EcoVadis platform and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> based on fourmajor topics: environment, labour, ethics, and supply chain. Pernod Ricard asks its risky suppliers to be re-assessed every year for high risk suppliers and every two years for medium-risk suppliers in order to identify areas for improvement and to review the effectiveness of their action plans;\n- labour and ethical audits following the SMETA (Sedex glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Members Ethical Trade Audit) standards, in line with the AIM Progress 'Mutual Recognition Programme'.\n\n| Number of suppliers                                           | FY20   | FY21   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Having signed the Supplier Standards                          | 1,983  | 1,719  |\n| Analysed through the Risk Mapping tool                        | 2,284  | 1,900  |\n| Identified as risky and covered by an EcoVadis assessment     | 214    | 220    |\n| Identified as risky with production sites covered by an audit | 14     | 108    |\n\nAs far as employee commitment is concerned, Pernod Ricard makes a number of training documents available to inform employees about the Responsible Procurement process of the Group and what actions each employee can take to mitigate risks with their suppliers. For example, Pernod Ricard offers an online learning module covering merchandising. It is designed for Marketing and Communications employees and highlights the risks related to the development and purchasing of promotional products. In addition, training is offered in various formats throughout the year, including telephone calls, workshopsand seminars.\n\nThe Group will take the following steps:\n\n- request all suppliers, from all categories, to sign the Supplier glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Standards on Partner Up;\n- complete analysis of direct suppliers (Dry and Wet Goods) and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> key indirect suppliers (POS/VAPs);\n- explore partnership plans to engage in amulti-stakeholder glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> programme. Pernod Ricard is already working with Bonsucro, a/uni00A0global multi-stakeholder non-profit organisation to promote sustainable sugarcane production, processing and trade worldwide. The/uni00A0Group is also part of Aim-Progress, a forum of leading Fast Moving Consumer Goods manufacturers and common suppliers, assembled to enable and promote responsible sourcing practices and sustainable supply chains. As a signatory member of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), Pernod Ricard also participates in various webinars related to Human Rights, decent work and living wages;\n- train Procurement Managers and/or functions on Responsible glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Procurement processes including labour rights and Human Rights considerations;\n- expand Responsible Procurement processes to other key glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> indirect categories.\n\n## TheBarWorldofTomorrow 3.3.2.6\n\n| Policies                        | Targets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Progress in FY21   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | By 2030, train 10,000 bartenders on all aspects of/uni00A0sustainability and responsibility/uni00A0- from fresh ingredient use to responsible serving of/uni00A0alcoholic beverages to waste management.

        "page_content": "As numerous sectors, the hospitality sector has a role to play in the transition towards a more sustainable and responsible world. To guide bartenders and bar owners in this transition Pernod Ricard has created The Bar World of Tomorrow an in-person and online training course, created in partnership with the Trash Collective and the Sustainable Restaurant Association, available worldwide. The course covers all aspects of S&R/uni00A0from fresh ingredient use to responsible serving of alcoholic beverages to waste management/uni00A0- directly aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is based on four pillars (ingredients, service, bar and staff) and the 5Rs model: Rethink, Reduce, Reuse, Recycleand Respect.\n\nOnline, it is a free e-learning course available to all legal-drinking aged adults and housed on EdApp and UNITAR's (United Nations Institute for Training and Research) EducateAll platform, available in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Polish, Turkish and Mandarin.\n\nInFY20 a toolkit was shared to conduct trainings sessions (in person or video conference), aimed at guiding S&R leaders, brand ambassadors and/or advocacy colleagues to train bar owners and bartenders on the key principles of The Bar World of Tomorrow. All training sessions are reported to local S&R leaders so that they can thereafter share with HQ the number of attendees. In addition, several tools were created to share with participants: Trash Collective Cocktail Recipes, a detailed checklist Bar World of Tomorrow, a responsible service cheat sheet and a 'badge' of completion.\n\n## Circular Making 3.3.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe world's finite ressources are under huge pressure.Pernod Ricard wants to do its part in decreasing the natural resources used and minimising waste at every step of the value chain. This will involve imagining new production ways that optimise and help preserve natural resources.\n\nThe traditional single-use consumption model has now reached its limits and new circular models must emerge to protect our planet and natural resources. Circularity is one of the Group's key priorities. To/uni00A0become more\n\ncircular, Pernod Ricard is committed to moving its business towards a circular making model that fosters reduction, reuse and recycling. Such a shift will allow fewer resources to be consumed, waste disposed of and ultimately reduce Pernod Ricard's environmental impact.\n\n## Environmental management 3.3.3.1\n\nPernod Ricard strives to implement strong environmental management systems throughout the business. They are the cornerstones of the Group' strategy, helping it tackle long-term environmental risks, reduce/uni00A0its environmental impact and seize opportunities at every level. Environmental management systems aim to disseminate the Group's environmental standards throughout the business and incorporate environmental considerations into its management practices. This/uni00A0helps manage risksand transform the business into a more circular model.\n\nPernod Ricard has environmental management systems to address environmental priorities and implement tangible actions throughout the business activities. Environmental management systems are implemented based on the following principles:\n\n- the Headquarters' Sustainable Performance Division oversees glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and coordinates measures at Group level by setting shared goals, monitoring performance, circulating guidelines with minimum requirements and sharing best practices. Each Brand Company is required to evaluate its performance against these requirements annually. Where necessary, compliance action plans should be implemented;\n- Pernod Ricard's activities, both for the Brand Companies and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the Market Companies, must comply with the environmental requirements outlined in the Group environmental guidelines:\n- affiliates are accountable for complying with local legal glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> requirements. They must also report to Headquarters any local incidents or non-compliance,\n- affiliates are accountable for assessing their long-term glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> risks. They/uni00A0must thus identify ways to reduce their own environmental impact and apply the Group's policy locally;\n- major production sites are required to be ISO/uni00A014001 certified. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> In FY21, 92.1% of production sites were ISO/uni00A014001 certified (covering/uni00A099.7% of production);\n- Group employees and administrative sites are required to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> meet the requirements of the 'S&R Office' guidelines regarding different topics such as green offices governance, energy, water, waste and business travel.\n\nThis year, one environmental incident was reported to local authorities and two complaints received from third parties. This includes all possible potential impact of an industrial site, in particular smells and noise.The/uni00A0events are described below:\n\n- one accidental spillage modifying the biological process of the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> treatment plant and resulting in CODand pH exceeded legal limits, in Spain;\n- one noise pollution complaint in Australia and one odour glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> pollution complaint in Scotland.\n\nA root cause analysis was conducted for all these events and corrective actions plans drawnup.\n\nAs of 30/uni00A0June 2021, no provisions have been funded for environmental risks. Some affiliates had to provide guarantees when applying for operating permits. These are not forspecific amounts but ensure the affiliates' solvency to deal with any pollution or other environmental accidents.",

The objectives were the understanding of climate-related risks impacts on our operations (raw materials, packaging, production and logistics) and the building of a prospective approach for climate-related risks scenarios applicableat Group level.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe identification of climate-related risks and opportunities takes place in the course of the Group's global risk mapping:\n\n- global risk mapping, based on local risks identified by Group glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> affiliates and functional risks identified by the Group's\n\nfunctions, is updated every three years by the internal audit team. This/uni00A0team reports to the Chairman and CEO. It also presents its results to the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. The/uni00A0Group's major risks are monitored annually;\n\n- environmental risk mapping is based on a multi-criteria glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> mapping tool. Affiliates input the data, whichis thenmonitored at Group level.Affiliates identify and rate environmental risks throughout a product's life cycle based on two criteria: i) severity (including potential financial impact/uni00A0- scored from 1 to 7) and ii) probability (scored from 1 to 5).\n\nIn terms of managing these risks, each major risk identified is placed under the responsibility of a Group Director. Environmental risks and their mitigation plans are under the responsibility of the Group Operations Director. The Group's environmental roadmap also draws up environmental action plans for the main environmental risks.",

Reduction is aligned with the below 2\u00b0C scenario and will be reviewed next year to be aligned with 1.5\u00b0C; by 2030: 50% reduction in the intensity of the Scope/uni00A03 glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> carbon footprint (base year 2018). This reduction is aligned with 2\u00b0C scenario and will be reviewed next year to be aligned with 1.5\u00b0C; | A taskforce has been set up with the main distilleries glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> to/uni00A0identify technologies that will help achieve Scope/uni00A01 SBTs. In FY20, the Group has officially become a member glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of/uni00A0RE100, a global initiative led by The Climate Group in/uni00A0partnership with CDP which brings together over 300 international companies committed to 100% renewable electricity.

Pernod Ricard's products inherently rely on agriculture. Establishing and helping improve agricultural practices is therefore a strategic priority for the Group.\n\nOn its own land, the Group promotes regenerative agriculture, which/uni00A0can help capture carboninthe soil. Moreover, the Group works with agricultural suppliers to establish preferred standards for each crop. The/uni00A0goal is to identify the best way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions for each crop.\n\n## TRANSPORT\n\nPernod Ricard seeks to optimise land transport by improving vehicle loading, adjusting schedules and using more efficient vehicles. In/uni00A0the/uni00A0US, the Group is also a member of Smartways Association, which/uni00A0aims to reduce land transportation emissions. In Europe, the/uni00A0Absolut Company is a member of the Clean Shipping Project.\n\n## PRODUCTION SITES\n\nOn production sites, the Group is working on two fronts: i) improving energy efficiency and ii) using less and less carbon-intensive energy. To encourage such transitions, the Group has introduced an internal carbon price of \u20ac50 per ton of CO2 equivalent for investments.\n\nOperationally, production sites must improve energy efficiency through continuous monitoring of energy consumption and in-depth energy assessments. The idea is to set energy-efficiency targets and launch consumption reduction programmes ( i.e. : renewal of processes, technologies, etc.). Several large sites have implemented ISO/uni00A050001 certified energy management systems.\n\nMoreover, the Group is working to replace fossil fuel energy sources and plans to only use renewableelectricity by 2025. This year, Scope/uni00A01 (direct CO2 equivalent emissions) increased by 4.1% in line with the 5% increase in production volumes. Scope/uni00A02 (indirect CO2 equivalent emissions) remains stable with 29,178 tonnes compared to 29,557 tonnes last year due to an increase in renewable electricity sourcing. In terms of carbon intensity, this/uni00A0represents a 1.4% fall per unit between FY20 and FY21 for Scopes/uni00A01 and 2 carbon emissions. This is due to an improvement in energy efficiency of our activities after Covid-19 crisis.\n\n## BREAKDOWNOFENERGYCONSUMPTIONBYACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->",

Some of these gases also increase the greenhouse effect. A/uni00A0programme to eliminate the most environmentally harmful refrigerant gases has been ongoing for numerous years. This/uni00A0has/uni00A0resulted in the complete elimination of CFCs and a continuous reduction of HCFCs.\n- Nitrogen and sulphur oxide emissions (NOx and SOx) glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> contributing indirectly to the greenhouse effect and environmental acidification. These compounds are produced by fossil fuel combustion. As/uni00A0emissions of these atmospheric pollutants are low in thealcoholic beverages sector compared to worldwide emissions, they seem to have no material impact on Pernod Ricard.The Group does not therefore feel it needs to monitor such emissions on an annual basis. The major distilleries nevertheless ensure that they comply with legal limits on the discharge of such pollutants.\n\n## Preserve water resources 3.3.3.3\n\nWater is an essential component of the products manufactured by Pernod Ricard. From irrigating crops to processing raw materials, distilling, blending eaux-de-vie and formulating products, wateris involved in every stage of the product's life cycle.\n\nThe Group thus faces several challenges. It must i) reduce water consumption, particularly in areas with shortages, ii) preserve water quality by monitoring pollutants released by production sites, and/uni00A0iii)/uni00A0fully comply with evolving environmental regulations. Pernod Ricard has been a member of the UN CEO Water Mandate since September/uni00A02010, thereby reaffirming its commitment to protect the planet's water resources.\n\n| Policies   | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Achievements and next steps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|            | Further reduction in water use by 20% from FY18 glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> to/uni00A0FY30. 100% of water replenished in watersheds with same level of risk for/uni00A0our/uni00A0production sites and dedicated Exploring innovative ways to reuse organic waste. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | 2030 S&R Strategy Since FY18, water consumption per unit produced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|            | glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> copackers located in high risk areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | has/uni00A0been reduced by 8.3%.

        "page_content": "To reduce direct water consumption at production sites, the Group focuses its efforts on two main drivers: i) setting up systems to measure and monitor wateruse, and ii) identifying measures to save, reuse and recycle water. This year, the return to normal for activities after the Covid-19 impact and a continuous improvement in water efficiency measures led to a reduction of 5.3% in water use per litre of pure alcohol produced in distilleries, down by 5.3% compared to last year.\n\nThis year, the Group consolidated the water reduction roadmaps from the main contributing affiliates and identified associated investment plans to reach 2030 targets.\n\nThroughout the value chain, the drip irrigation technique is used in all irrigated vineyardsoperated by the Group. This reduces the water used to what is strictly necessary. Moreover, given the predominance of agricultural raw materials in Pernod Ricard's water footprint, the Group works locally with the affiliates' suppliers to establish sustainable agriculture standards that minimise water consumption (see/uni00A0subsection/uni00A03.3.1.4 'Impactful programmes on regenerative agriculture and biodiversity').\n\n## Water resource preservation strategy tailored to/uni00A0meet local challenges\n\nBecause water resources are unevenly distributed, risk levels vary depending on the location of the Group's production sites and dedicated co-packing activities. To better understand and identify priorities, sites have been categorised as extremely high risk, high risk and low-medium risk, using an internal Water Risk Index. The Group aims to replenish the water used by its sites located in high-risk areas through local projects to preserve the water ecosystems. This led to support watershed management by improving access to safewater and sanitation, promoting sustainable water use and integrating water resources management among communities.\n\n| Area's risk level                                                                                                                                                                 | Pernod Ricard situation                                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Eight/uni00A0company-owned sites (India, Armenia, Mexico and China). glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> 8.2% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | Extremely high risk                                                         |\n| High risk Seven/uni00A0company-owned sites (Armenia, Australia, Spain and France).                                                                                                | glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>                                             |\n| 26 company-owned/uni00A0sites. 8.4% of the Group's total water consumption.                                                                                                       | Medium risk glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> |\n| 48/uni00A0company-owned sites. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> 77.5% of the Group's total water consumption. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>                                      | Low risk                                                                    |\n\nSeven/uni00A0Indian dedicated co-packers are located in high-risk areas and are concerned by the Group water resource preservation strategy.\n\nThe water resource preservation strategy has been launched on sites located in 'extremely high risk' and 'high-risk' areas.PR India have already implemented water projects in their watersheds. They are actively engaged with communities through the development of water replenishment projects in order to support water conservationand also provide or improve access to safe waterand sanitation. Other sites are in the process of finding a project partner and investigating water project options. The methodology used to calculate water returned to/uni00A0the environment for each project must be verified by a third party.\n\n## Treatment of waste water\n\nTo reduce the pollutants released into the natural environment and make sure that the water discharge by production sites does not damage surrounding ecosystems or othernatural resources, production sites are fitted with different technologies such as aerobic, anaerobic treatments, filtration, etc., depending on waste water quality requirements. The Group will also explore innovative projects for treating this waste water.\n\nThis year, 77% of waste-water was discharged into a public sewerage system, 17% was discharged into the environment following treatment,and 6% was recycled for vineyard irrigation.\n\n| Overall performance                                                | Unit       | FY18       | FY20       | FY21       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Total volume of water used                                         |            | 6,008,142  | 5,810,414  | 5,781,472  |\n| Total volume of water abstracted                                   | m 3        | 25,195,334 | 22,118,588 | 22,752,799 |\n| Total volume of waste water released                               |            | 4,390,900  | 4,281,165  | 4,266,566  |\n| Water consumption per unit produced at production sites            | m 3 /kl PA | 25.82      | 24.99      | 23.68      |\n| Chemical oxygen demand (COD) released into the natural environment | t          | 926        | 877        | 885        |",

The key issue is therefore to improve waste sorting solutions for consumers so that packaging can be recycled or reused. Pernod Ricard has set up or joined various programmes worldwide to improve recycling or reuse packaging:\n\n- Europe: Group contribution of around \u20ac10/uni00A0million to national glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> schemes designed to improve the collectionand recycling of domestic packaging, including glass;\n\n| Policies                  | Objectives                                                                       | Achievement in FY21                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Waste management ambition | Zero waste sent to landfill at production glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> level. | 147/uni00A0tonnes of waste sent to landfill this glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> year, 74% reduction compared to/uni00A0FY20. |\n\n## Limiting of food waste\n\nThe Group takes steps to minimise food waste throughout its value chain:\n\n- upstream agriculture: reducing food waste by reusing glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> by-products from the production of certain foods. For example, broken rice in India or sugarcane molasses in Cuba, to produce alcohol. Moreover, in/uni00A0developed countries, where most agricultural raw materials used by the Group are sourced, the quality of infrastructure plus short supply routes prevent products such as cereals from perishing. As/uni00A0for/uni00A0grapes, musts or wine, they are delivered directly tothe Group's wineries by producers, limiting supply chain losses;\n- production sites:focus on recycling waste generated through glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the transformation of raw agricultural materials (spent grains, vinasse and grape pomace).Themajority of waste is recycled to make animal feed, biogas, farm compost or used for other industrial purposes;\n- consumer level: waste generated is very low since wine & glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> spirits can be kept for a long time, and the packaging is designed to last until the product is fully consumed.\n\n## Reducing waste and improving recycling on industrial sites\n\nThe production sites mostly generate non-hazardous waste (99% of total waste vs. 1% hazardous waste):\n\n- non-hazardous waste: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- packaging waste (glass, paper, cardboard and plastics), glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- waste from the transformation ofagricultural raw materials glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> not recovered as by-products (grape marc, stalks, sediment, etc.),\n- waste produced by the site's activities (sludge from glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> treatment plants, office waste, green waste, etc.);\n- hazardous waste: waste used for the sites' operation glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> (chemical/uni00A0product containers, used oils, solvents, electrical and electronic waste, neon tubes, batteries, etc.).\n\nThe Group's aims at moving towards zero landfill waste. To/uni00A0achieve this goal, the affiliates will pursue efforts to reduce the quantity of waste generated and identify recycling and recovery processes. For hazardous waste requiring the use of a specific treatment process to prevent environmental risks, the Group will continue to identify appropriate treatment processes locally.\n\n- United States: it joined the 'Glass Recycling Coalition' to foster glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> efficient and economically viable recycling channels by involving all players in the chain (glass manufacturers, bottlers, recycling service providers, etc.);\n- Brazil: joined the 'Glass is Good' project, whose purpose is to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> increase the glass recycling rate by involving all sectorial players.\n\nThis year, the Group also identified 10 key markets (India, USA, Canada, China, France, Brazil,Spain, Russia, South Africa and Poland) where projects will be developed with local partners to increase glass collection, recycling and reuse.\n\n## Reduce waste 3.3.3.5\n\nLimiting waste throughout the production chain and at the end of product life is an integral part of the Group's circular economy approach. Pernod Ricard is committed to minimising waste disposal and maximising the recycling and reuse of its products. Pernod Ricard's policy is focused on limiting food waste and eliminating landfill waste, ensuring all waste generated on industrial sites is recycled.",

However, the Group also acknowledges that alcohol can be misused, and that inappropriate consumption of alcohol can cause serious problems to individuals and communities. The Group believes it has a role to play in preventing and reducing the harmful use of alcohol. Pernod Ricard is committed to promoting responsible alcohol consumption and combating harmful drinking - working with stakeholders to achieve real change and\n\ncontinuously developing and strengthening its responsible marketing practices.\n\nPernod Ricard is not alone in promoting responsible drinking. Partnerships with otherindustry members, governmentsand local communities are essential to success in this area. Positive change can only be achieved in unison with others, with one collective voice.\n\n## Responsible Drinking Roadmap\n\nPernod Ricard is committed promoting responsible drinking and reducing the harmful use of alcohol. The Group fully supports the World HealthOrganization's (WHO) goal of reducing harmful drinking by 10% worldwide by 2025.Pernod Ricard however does not believe that an across the board cut in average per capita consumption is supporting public health needs: indeed, the pursuit of such a strategy in the past has led to a decrease in consumption amongst moderate drinkers without any meaningful impact on those that drink at harmful levels. Forthis, the Group has a Responsible Drinking strategy focusing on tackling harmfulabuse of alcohol.\n\nThe Group's roadmap encompasses a wide range of initiatives targeting its employees, consumers, target audiences and society as a whole. The set of tools varies from in-house trainings and self-regulating standards to communication campaigns and\n\nevidence-based prevention programmes. By using this all-round approach, the Group aims at finding the most efficient ways to fight the harmfulabuse of alcohol for each target group and context specific to each market.\n\nThe strategy is fully aligned with the Group's 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9' vision as there is no conviviality in excessive or inappropriate drinking.Adult consumers must make responsible choices about whether or not to drink alcohol, and how much to drink. It is also aligned with its premiumisation strategy. The/uni00A0Group wants adult consumers to consume better and high-quality products, not increase their overall alcohol consumption.\n\nThe Alcohol in Society team within the Public Affairs Department coordinates the Group's Responsible Hosting strategy which is implemented through the network of S&R and Public Affairs leaders.\n\nPernod Ricard is a member of the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking IARD (1) , a non-profit organization regrouping leading global beer, wine & spirits producers to fight the harmful use of alcohol. The Group supports IARD's commitments on digital marketing, commercial practices and a series of measures to combat underage drinking (more information below).\n\n## Responsible drinking programmes 3.3.4.1 and/uni00A0campaigns\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nPernod Ricard continues its efforts to reduce the harmful use of alcohol through evidence-based prevention programmes. These initiatives are implemented locally by its affiliates, in partnership with industry peers, civil society,international bodies and local authorities.\n\nThe Group's brands support this commitment by developing dedicated responsible drinking campaigns to promote responsible drinking behaviours amongst its consumers.\n\n## Local initiatives\n\nPernod Ricard believes that targeted preventive actions rolled out locally are an effective way of tackling alcohol abuse to make alcohol consumption a safe and enjoyable experience. Each affiliate/market is committed to contributing to at least one responsible drinking programme or campaign, in partnership and evaluated to demonstrate real outcome from their actions.",

Many responsible drinking initiatives have been put on hold, postponed or stopped\n\n## Global initiatives\n\n## Responsible Party\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                                                               | Progress in FY20                                                                                                                                      | Progress in FY21                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | By 2030, Pernod Ricard will glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> expand the concept of Responsible Party worldwide, reaching 3/uni00A0million young adults | 470,000 (1) young adults reached glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> on/uni00A0the field and 2.7/uni00A0million young adults digitally at 30/uni00A0June. | 470,100/uni00A0young adults reached glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> on/uni00A0the field and 6/uni00A0million young adults digitally at 30/uni00A0June. |\n\nAlthough due to the current pandemic, the Responsible Party programme has not beenable to operateat on the field events throughout 2021, Responsible Party has remained present on digital through the Sharing Good Vibes campaign until December/uni00A02020, which cumulated 6/uni00A0million visitors since its launch in April/uni00A02020. In July/uni00A02021, a new campaign currently under development will be launched.\n\nOther digital tools have also been developed such as the Responsible Party website/uni00A0 (2) and the 'Responsible Party, Make Good Times Unforgettable' e-learning platform created with EdApp. The platform currently counts 672 users and this is growing. The Responsible Party programme has continued its efforts with the Erasmus Students Network (ESN) through social media to encourage participation in this e-learning (through targeted quizzes and competitions).\n\nTowards the end of the year, with improvement in the sanitary situation, Responsible Party was able to host the partnership renewal event in Brussels on 24/uni00A0June. This was the first physical event in 18/uni00A0months that brought together 100 young adults from Europe for a conference and responsible celebration. The event was in partnership with ESN and HOTREC (European association of Hotel, Restaurants, Bars and Caf\u00e9s) and promoted safe togetherness through a signed declaration. The declaration was launched during the event and was a demonstration of solidarity between the three signing partners, expressing their willingness to move forward together in a safe and responsible way. It has also been signed 32/uni00A0times since the event by both organizations and individuals and continues to be available online and to amass support.\n\n## Autosobriety\n\nThis year, Pernod Ricard has partnered with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) for the implementation of the Autosobriety training programme. Autosobriety aims at equipping road safety stakeholders with educational tools in order raise awareness on the risks of drinking and driving and contributes to the prevention and reduction of alcohol-related road crashes.\n\nThe overall objective of Autosobriety is to contribute to theUN Global Road Safety Performance Target #9 to halve the number of alcohol-related road traffic injuries and fatalities by 2030.\n\nAutosobriety's main asset is a digital educational module covering four topics: road crash statistics, the impact of alcohol on the ability to drive and relevant risks, the legal ramifications of drinking and driving and the personal responsibility to avoid drink-driving. In addition, an augmented reality video was developed to simulate the effects of alcohol on driving and the increasing risks of road accident.\n\nThe project was tested as a pilot project this year in the Durban province of South Africa, coordinated by the International Training Centre for Authorities and Leaders (CIFAL Durban), and in the Dominican Republic, coordinated by the National Institute of Ground Transit and Transportation (INTRANT). In both countries, the first phase of the programme was implemented, targeting primarily at government officials and municipality workers. At a next stage, the programme is planned to reach final road users with a target of 5,000 beneficiaries in each market.\n\n## Brand campaigns\n\nPernod Ricard believes that marketing can be a force for good, bringing social value and helping consumers to adopt a responsible behaviour regarding alcohol. Brands know how to talk to consumers and their campaigns can be an effective way to change their attitudes and make alcohol abuse socially unacceptable.\n\nOver the past 18/uni00A0months, we have seen Absolut Vodka engaging in responsibility campaigns. The campaigns 'Drink Responsibly. Sex responsibly' (February/uni00A02020) and its sequel 'Drink Responsibly. Love Responsibly' (February/uni00A02021) addressed the topics of responsible drinking and safe consensual sex, as well as love in times of lockdown. Together with the campaign 'Drink Responsibly. Vote Responsibly' (November/uni00A02020), which encouraged US citizens to prioritise voting in the US elections and to save their drinking until after their voting, these three campaigns reached more than 80/uni00A0million consumers in the US. Absolut Vodka has also takenastance against drinking and driving in Argentina through its campaign'Absolut Nothing'.\n\naltogether. All initiatives that required on-site presence - such as educational programmes, on-trade awareness campaigns, or student responsible parties' activations - could not be repeated. In some instances, resources dedicated to responsible drinking have been channelled to Covid-19 support initiatives. This crisis has also impacted the way prevention is being made, with a clear focus on digital tools and the need to mutualise resources across countries.",

With Covid-19 conditions progressively improving,Pernod Ricard expects its affiliates to resume or continue their local engagement, notably through more global tools such as those described below.\n\nResponsible Party, through the tagline 'Make Good Times Unforgettable' will be continuing its activities on the field and on social media for the next year, notably launching a new bold and disruptive campaign: \"Drink More (Water)\". This prevention campaign will be launched on a global level and also locally in countries across the world. This campaign will be launched from mid-July/uni00A02021 and will run over a few months.Evaluation metrics will be put in place to measure not only the reach and engagement around the campaign on social media but also to measure the impact and success of the messaging.\n\nOn the field, Responsible Party will continue to strengthen the relationship with ESN, whilst also seeking new partners and opportunities, such as festivals, where the programme can continue to co-create safe and responsible events and share messages of responsibility around binge drinking.\n\nPernod Ricard has renewed its partnership with UNITAR and expects to expand Autosobriety in no less than eight new countries in the next two/uni00A0years.\n\nThe strategic brands of the Group have taken the commitment to roll out responsible drinking campaigns over the five next years.\n\n| Policies         | Targets                                                                                                                                                   | Progress in FY20                                                                                  | Progress in FY21                                                                                              |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2030 S&R Roadmap | 95% compliance with IARD Digital glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Guiding Principles by 2024. 100% completion rate for the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | 73% based on external audit. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> 66%. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | 89% based on internal glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> monitoring (1) . 75.3%. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> |\n\n## Responsible Marketing Panel (RMP)\n\nCreated in 2005, the RMP is responsible for ethical oversight of advertising, in charge of screening all advertising material due to be rolled out.It counts six members and a secretary general, all independent from the Marketing Department. The RMP reports to the Executive Committee on a monthly basis. Two members of the Executive Committee act as sponsors and are also consulted on any changes to the CCC or the drafting of implementing guidelines.\n\nAll commercial communications must be submitted to the RMP whichissues an opinion within seven days. All decisions are taken collectively by RMP members and are binding for everyone in the Group.\n\nIn case of doubt about a campaign submitted for approval, the RMP has the right to request an opinion from the local or regional advertising regulatory authorities in the relevant markets.\n\nThe Panel provides one ofthe following three opinions on each campaignor element of a campaignsubmitted:\n\n- campaign approved with no restrictions; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- campaign approved subject to modifications; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- campaign rejected (in this case it must be re-submitted). glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nDue to the pandemic it was not possibleto train all affiliates on the CCC but trainings were delivered to 265 people from various affiliates, brand houses and innovation hubs.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nWith the implementation of the Pernod Ricard CCC, the Group will continue to deliver a Convivialit\u00e9 brand experience and responsibility in compliance with industry commitments and advertising authority requirements.\n\nGuidelines for new types of Marketing are under preparation in order to confer the maximum compliance with the Group's highest standards for Responsible Marketing.\n\n## Objectives and policies\n\nPernod Ricard believes that strong self-regulation is effective in meeting the ethical expectations of consumers and stakeholders in a rapidly changing media landscape while at the same time building brand equity. Going beyond the Advertising and Marketing Communications Code of the International Chamber of Commerce, Pernod Ricard's Code for Commercial Communications (CCC) ensures that the Group's commercial communications in particular do not encourage or condone irresponsible consumption or misuse of any kind.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to being an industry leader in helping raise the standard for responsible marketing of alcoholic beverages. A/uni00A0special focus is put on digital marketing.In 2014, IARD partnered with social media platforms to establish the Digital Guiding Principles. The/uni00A0Group immediately extended the scope of its CCC to require that all online marketing meet the same high standards as traditional marketing.\n\nIn 2020, the Group updated its CCC, strengthening all guidelines (provision mandating modelsshall be over 25/uni00A0years old and shall meet certain requirements) and adding guidelines in 2021 for product placement to keep raising standards.",

In addition to providing such information on its brands' websites, Pernod Ricard worksclosely with the European industry bodies and stakeholders on the creation of a digital label that would offer European consumers immediate access to all relevant information through their smartphone.\n\nThis year, Pernod Ricard and its peers of the IARD have announced that they will ensure that an age restriction logo and a logo warning against driving while intoxicated will be visible inall markets where they distribute their products by 2024.\n\nThe/uni00A0Group has decided to add both logos to all its products distributed around the world/uni00A0- where not restricted by local laws and regulations, alongside the logo warning against drinking during pregnancy that Pernod Ricard has been applying to its labels since 2006.

This training gives basic information on alcohol related risks, so that employees know the facts about alcohol and can make an informed decision whether to drink alcohol or not and how to drink responsibly.\n\nThis training has been made compulsory for all the Group's employees worldwide. The Group has nearly reached its target of training 100% of its active employees. The 10% gap is mainly due to the difficult work conditions this year and the difficulty to reach out to some employees during the lock-down in many countries this year.\n\nThe training embeds the Group's new Global Responsible Drinking Charter. The Group expects all employees to comply with this Charter as a breach could present a risk to health and safety of employees and third parties. When completing the training, each employee reads, acknowledges and signs the Global Responsible Drinking Charter. In addition, the affiliates implement local responsible drinking charters that include local norms and regulations.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nPernod Ricard will continue to train its employees on responsible drinking, and to enrol them as ambassadors of responsible drinking through their acknowledgement and signing of the Global Responsible Drinking Charter.\n\nPernod Ricard will also develop a targeted training on responsible drinking for sales staff.Being on the frontline of the business, sales teams might face challenging situations relating to the consumption of alcohol. Their health and safety should always come first, so throughout this training the sales teams will learn how to identify the alcohol-related risks for themselves as well as our consumers and how to react in a professional and safe way.\n\nPernod Ricard also launched an awareness campaign during the pandemic forits employees, to promote responsible drinking in these times of pandemic and confinement.",

This has resulted in a significant commitment effort in terms of the prevention of risks associated with alcohol abuse. It also led to a strict policy in terms of food safety during the process of product design, sourcing and manufacturing.\n\nThe control of consumer product safety is based on the implementation of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) method that aims to identify all potential risk points in the manufacturing process.\n\nAppropriate preventive measures are then put in place to control them. Brand Companies producing the Group's strategic brands are ISO/uni00A09001 certified. This represents 99.7% of the volume produced.In addition, and despite Wines & Spirits being less exposed to food safety risksthan other food industry segments, Pernod Ricard also took the decision to have its facilities certified in accordance with ISO/uni00A022000 (Food safety management systems).\n\nQuality internal standards are established by Pernod Ricard for its industrial activities including various specific guidelines. The aim is to controlrisks such as the accidental contamination of a product or the presence of a foreign body in a bottle. These standards are audited as part of an internal cross-audit process. In FY21, this process was impacted by the pandemic but some cross audits were able to be carried out remotely focusing on key area such as foreign bodies, complaint management and traceability. At end of FY21, it has been possible to re-perform cross audit on site regarding local sanitary context.\n\nThe Group'sabsolute priority is to ensure its products comply with the regulations applicable to each of its various markets, and to guarantee food safety for consumers. A safety watch is conducted and circulated to all affiliates every two/uni00A0months in order to anticipate and inform on any changes regarding applicable regulations and food safety risks. A chemical analysis plan for the Group's main products is conducted every year. In FY21, this involved 60 finished products and a total of over 2,000 analyses were carried out.\n\nIn addition, a Group Intranet site called 'Complaint Management System' is used to record and track quality complaints from consumers in real time. The affiliate in question is immediately informed so that corrective action can be taken. In the case of a serious product safety concern issue, the system also immediately informs Headquarters, allowing for rapid response. Each affiliate has a crisis management procedure. This is particularly for product health risk involving, if necessary, a product recall. These procedures are subject to regular testing, training for people involved and updates. Quality indicators including the complaints rate are presented to the Senior Management.\n\nIn addition, the Group is committed to ensuring complete GMO traceability of its products. This allows it to assure consumers strict compliance with the labelling regulations for products containing GMOs. Accordingly, all affiliates conduct a risk assessment to identify potential sources of raw materials, taking the necessary measures to ensure control of these sources. Although the distillation stage eliminates the risk that GMO material may be present in distilled products, supply chains for products that are guaranteed GMO-free have been established for certain corn-based alcohols in the United States and Europe.\n\n|                                                                                                | FY20   | FY21   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| % of sites ISO/uni00A022000 certified by June of the fiscal year                               | 79%    | 78%    |\n| % ISO/uni00A022000 certified in volume produced covering all the Group's strategic brands      | 99.8%  | 99.7%  |\n| % Brand Companies that are producing Group's strategic brands are certified ISO/uni00A09001    | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Number of complaints received through the 'Complaint Management System' during the fiscal year | 3,300  | 4,100  |\n\n## Personal data protection 3.4.1.2\n\n## Objectives\n\nPersonal data protection is a pillar in the digital transformation of the Group.

This governance structure involves a wide range of stakeholders, including the Group DPO, personal data protection Champions at regional and local level, along with a Personal Data Protection Steering Committee as well as the various internal business teams (IT, marketing, HR, etc.).\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT & UPSKILLING\n\nAs a pillar of the Group's digital transformation, data personal data protection is a matter that concerns everyone at Pernod Ricard.\n\nThis iswhy Pernod Ricard places a particular focus and efforts on legal monitoring, employee training (including with Group-wide MOOCs as well as both mandatory and tailor-made subject-specific trainings), internal awareness campaigns and more generally on change management.\n\n## CUSTOM TOOLS & PROCEDURES\n\nThe Group has created various custom, user-friendly tools and procedures to ensure personal data protection compliance, including:\n\n- a comprehensive overarching documentation to ensure glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> consistent implementation of personal data protection and commonstandards based on a global personal data protection policy, adapted for local requirements, along with detailed procedures and toolkits;\n- personal data protection by design and by default procedures glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and processes implemented on new projects, with specific privacy documentation on major projects ( e.g. /uni00A0development of the latest version of the consumer database);\n- audit processes and questionnaires to assess third parties' glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> maturity and compliance level on personal data protection;\n- checklists and templates on specific topics such as handling glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> data subject requests, or handling potential personal data protection breaches.\n\n## Prevention of corruption 3.4.1.3 and/uni00A0anti-competitive practices\n\n## Prevention of corruption\n\nIntegrity,and a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and all related misconducts have long been part of Pernod Ricard's core values.\n\n- The Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct, prefaced and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> endorsed by the Chairman and CEO, applies to all employees of the Group.\n- Pernod Ricard's General Counsel - Compliance Officer is in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> charge of structuring and promoting the Group's comprehensive and robust anti-corruption programme.\n\n## RULES FOR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS\n\n- Pernod Ricard's Code of Business Conduct : the Code glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> (accessible/uni00A0on the Intranet and Group's website: https://www.pernod-ricard.com/en/download/file/fid/10234/), includes, in particular, a chapter related to the fight against corruption and business integrity in general. The Code also covers other topics such as compliance with competition law, prevention of insider trading and conflicts of interest.\n- Group anti-bribery policy: in accordance with the French glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> 2016 Sapin/uni00A02 law, thePolicy specifically details the Group's rules to prevent, deter and detect public and private corruption and influence peddling ( trafic d'influence ) risks. It also provides employees and stakeholders with clear, pragmatic examples of potentially sensitive situations.\n- Internal Control Principles : they apply to all Group affiliates glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and specify that all Pernod Ricard affiliates must comply, among other things, with the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct and the Procurement Code of Ethics. Pernod Ricard sends all affiliates a self-assessment questionnaire every year, in which they must state whether they are compliant with Group policies. The reliability of the responses to these questionnaires is confirmed in a letter of representation signed by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each entity. In addition, the Legal Department works with the internal audit team to conduct a number of compliance audits each year at certain affiliates. Finally, a further task of the internal audit is to monitor the Group's compliance with the rules implemented for the fight against corruption and influence peddling.\n- Whistleblowing policy : employees are invited to speak up glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> about, among other things, any potential corruption situation in relation tothe Pernod Ricard activities inside or outside the Company. As part of the protection owed to whistleblowers, alerts may be filed anonymously,and the Group promotes a clear non-retaliation policy (see subsection/uni00A03.4.2.3 \"Whistle-blower system\").\n- Prior verification policy : Pernod Ricard's Third Parties are glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> subject to a due diligence process to determine their compliance risk profile (low, medium or high),allowing the Group to adjust, as appropriate, contractual and operational relationships to mitigate potential risks. Various levels of verification are set out under the procedure, depending on the initial risk assessment of each relationship category, as identified by Pernod Ricard's Sapin/uni00A02 risk map on corruption and influence peddling.\n- Gifts and Hospitality policy : approval is required from the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Line Manager or the affiliate's designated key contact, prior to receiving or offering any gifts or hospitality above a determined amount set at affiliate level.",

The App has beenrevisited recently and is accessible on all of our electronic devices.\n- MOOC: training for employees on the Code of Business glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Conduct. With a 'learning by doing' approach, a new mandatory MOOC was kicked off in 2019 to train employees on our updated Code of Business Conduct.This new training was successfully completed by 92% of the mandatory target population during the first campaign ( i.e. all employees with a company-issued electronic device). Since then, the MOOC is a mandatory as part of the onboarding pack for new employees and completion is monitored.\n\n## Prevention of anti-competitive practices\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to the public policy goals of Competition laws and to acting lawfully in the marketplace. Such concern is unambiguouslyaddressed in a specific chapter of the Pernod Ricard Code of Business Conduct. The MOOC also includes a chapter on Competition law.\n\n## Transparency and integrity 3.4.1.4 of/uni00A0strategies and influencing practices\n\n## Policies and objectives\n\nGroup policy on lobbying is governed by the Code ofBusiness Conduct, which incorporates specific disciplines on dealings with public officials.\n\nIn addition, it is guided by more specific professional Codes (ECPA in Europe, Association pour les Relations avec les Pouvoirs Publics in France, etc.) and institutional Codes such as the EU Transparency Register (https://ec.europa.eu/\n\ntransparency-register), with which Pernod Ricard complies.\n\nIn addition, specific laws & regulations apply in the countries in which the Group operates. For instance, in France, the Group is registered on the list of representatives of interests established by the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life (https://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/?organisation= 582041943#%23).\n\nIt strictly complies with the High Authority's reporting obligations regarding lobbying activities. Transparency International even recognised its detailed reporting practice in their presentation of committed firms.\n\nThe Group has been a member of Transparency International France since 2013 and actively supports the promotion of transparency and integrity around lobbying and efforts made by this association. It is a signatory to a best practices guide on parliamentary lobbying expenditure.\n\nProactive signatory of a declaration made public on 25/uni00A0February/uni00A02014 initiated together with seven companies who are members of Transparency International France. This declaration is open to all companies, business federations, professional associations, trade/uni00A0unions and NGOs (members and non-members of Transparency France) who wish to show leadership through their ethics and corporate social responsibility commitments.\n\nThis joint declaration on lobbying was reinforced and updated in/uni00A0May/uni00A02019, including new signatories who reaffirm their commitments: https://transparency-france.org/actu/declarationcommune-entreprises- membres-de-transparency-internationalfrance-lobbying.\n\n## Action plans and next steps\n\nMaintain its cooperation with Transparency International.\n\nImprove description of internal organisation and give more detail on public policy issues on public-facing corporate website.\n\n## Taxpolicy 3.4.1.5\n\n## Asignificant contribution to local communities\n\nThe Group commits to comply with all laws and regulations in force in each of the countries in which it operates, as well as the applicable international standards.\n\nIn 2021, Pernod Ricard's income tax charge on recurring items (profit/uni00A0from recurring operations and financial result from recurring operations) was \u20ac519/uni00A0million.\n\nIn addition to corporate income tax, Pernod Ricard pays and collects numerous other taxes and contributions, including sales taxes, customs and excise duties, payroll taxes, property taxes and other local taxes specific to each country, as part of the Group's economic contribution to the communities in which it operates. Pernod Ricard's total contribution is estimated at around \u20ac5.7/uni00A0billion (unaudited data).\n\n## Approach to taxation\n\nThe Group applies the following principles in tax matters:\n\n- support for operational activity in compliance withapplicable glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> regulations;\n- integrity in the conduct of tax matters; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- tax management that is both proactive and efficient to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> preserve and maximise the value generated for the Group and its shareholders.\n\nPernod Ricard has several subsidiaries in some 73/uni00A0countries in which it operates. Whenever possible, management makes every effort to liquidate any dormant or quasi-dormant subsidiary inherited from past acquisitions.\n\nPernod Ricard is vigilant as to the operational and commercial reality of its transactions and refuses to take part in any artificial tax arrangements. The Group will only use tax incentives after considering their impact on its brands, reputation and Sustainability & Responsibility.The Group does not promote any form of tax evasion.",

        "page_content": "## Transfer pricing\n\nPernod Ricard's strategy and organisation are built on a decentralised model with an ongoing relationship between the Brand Companies and the Market Companies. The Brand Companies generally own, protect and develop the intellectual property. They are also in charge of developing the overall strategy for the brands as well as solutions and ways to activate them. The Market Companies implement this strategy at local level.\n\nRelated party transactions are carried out in accordance with the Group's transfer pricing policy, which is based on the arm's length principle ( i.e. on terms that would have been agreed betweenindependent parties).\n\n## Anefficient organisation\n\nPernod Ricard has a team of qualified and well-trained tax and customs specialists working under the supervision of the EVP Finance, IT and Operations. Clear internal control principles on tax matters have been defined and made available to all employees on the Intranet. Processes have beenput in place to prevent risks of tax evasion.\n\nThe tax legislation in the countries where Pernod Ricard operates is complex and can be subject to interpretation. Pernod Ricard manages these uncertainties with the help of internal and external tax experts. Tax provisions are measured based on the Group's best estimate based on the information available (in particular that provided by the Group's legal and tax advisors) and presented regularly to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Promotion of international transparency\n\nPernod Ricard is committed to being open and transparent with tax authorities and to disclosing relevant information to enable them to carry out their work.Pernod Ricard places particular importance on working positively, proactively and transparently with the tax authorities of the countries in which the Group operates in order to build honest and sustainable relationships and to beable to resolve potential disputes quickly.\n\nPernod Ricard respects the obligations of country-by-country reporting.\n\n## Presentation, implementation 3.4.2 and/uni00A0monitoring of/uni00A0the/uni00A0duty of care\n\nThe cross-reference tables below summarise the presentation of the information constituting the Group's duty of care plan and its implementation as required by article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code. Some of the information is contained elsewhere in Shapter/uni00A03, as/uni00A0well as in Shapter/uni00A04.\n\nSeveral departments and working groups are involved in identifying and monitoring the risks associated with the Group's business activities and its main suppliers and subcontractors, as well as implementing and monitoring the measures. The Departments involved are the Sustainability & Responsibility, Purchasing, HR, Internal Audit, Operations and Legal Departments.\n\nThe S&R Senior Steering Committee oversees the implementation of the Group's S&R Strategy and progress towards targetsset.Theroleof the S&R Committee at the Board of Directors' level is to monitor the progress of the S&R Strategy, challengeambitions and report to the widerBoard.\n\nRegarding the monitoring of measures, the Group uses different internal reporting systems and indicators for monitoring the implementation of the actions taken. The results have already been extensively published and audited with complete transparency in this report (see Sections/uni00A02, 3 and/uni00A04 in particular).\n\n## Risk identification and mapping 3.4.2.1\n\nPernod Ricard faces a rangeof internal and external risks in its own operations as well as in its supply chain. Themain risks currently estimated by the Group as well as the methodology are reported in Section/uni00A04 'Risk/uni00A0management' under 'Risk factors', as well as at the start of Section 3, in the section \"The main sustainability risks and opportunities. The mapping processes described below were drawn from Pernod Ricard's existing risk management systems.\n\nIn addition, in line with the requirement to publish a 'Non-Financial Statement', the Group has published its main non-financial risksand opportunities in Section/uni00A03.\n\nThe Group also participates in the development of corporate tax policies, tax transparency initiatives and tax legislation by taking part in public consultations.",

The Group's Code of Business Conduct advocates a Speak-up policy, calling on all employees to inform management ofany suspicions they may have. This may relate to a practice or situation deemed tobe contrary to or inconsistent with this Code, associated policies or any legal or regulatory standard. In FY19, Pernod Ricard launched a Group-wide system titled Speak-Up. This allows stakeholders who wish to report such misconducts to the Group to do so in a safe and confidential manner. Hosted by a third party, it is available24/7. Reports that are deemed to be filed in good faith can be subject to internal investigation following an preliminary assessment from the Integrity Committee. This is comprised of the following Group-level functions: Legal, Internal Audit, HR and S&R.\n\nIf the allegations reported end up to be substantiated, the Integrity Committee or its local delegate examines their severity and makes recommendations tothe management who decides on the appropriate mitigation and/or remediation measures, and/or disciplinary sanctions against the wrongdoer(s).\n\nPernod Ricard has a zero-tolerance policy towards retaliation against anyone who has reported an allegation or supported an investigation in good faith. Pernod Ricard conducts dedicated workshops with Human Resources Directors and with the legal and compliance network to manage whistleblowing cases and conduct investigations. The Group also runs global communication campaigns to increase awareness and improve employee understanding on what can be reported and how alerts are being processed.",

        "page_content": "## Methodology note and third-party verification 3.6\n\n## Methodology note relating 3.6.1 to/uni00A0non-financial reporting\n\n## Period & scope of reporting 3.6.1.1\n\nSocial, environmental and societal data isreported annually and relates to the period from 1/uni00A0July 2020 to 30/uni00A0June 2021. Unless otherwise stated, this data relates to activities under the Group's operational control.\n\n## Scope of social reporting\n\nThe social analyses in this report are based on all Group entities that have reported data on their employees for the relevant period.When/uni00A0the Group acquires a newly controlled entity and only when Pernod Ricard has the complete ownership of the entity,its corporateHR datais included in full in the figures. At the end of each financial year, the list of entities in the Group's social reporting is compared to the financial reporting list to ensure its completeness. In FY21, reporting covered 133 entities with employees during the year.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and level of detail for corporate data have changed since FY19. Social data isno longer reported by affiliate but by legal entity. This explains the increase in the number of entities covered since then.\n\nThis year, the following updates have been made:\n\n- France: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Pernod/uni00A0SAS & Ricard/uni00A0SAS merged into the entity Pernod glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Ricard France;\n- Asia: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Creation of Pernod Ricard Vietnam Spirits & Wines glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> CompanyLimited,\n- Creation of Pernod Ricard Asia Duty Free/uni00A0Ltd/uni00A0- Travel Retail glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Asia,\n- Creation of New World Liquor, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Dissolution of EURO TRADE LTD; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- LATAM: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Creation of D&CO Platform Services, SA de CV; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- EMEA: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- Dissolution of CG Hibbert. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Region includes the Asia distribution network and the Group's Wines business. This also includes Bodegas Tarsus and the Pernod Ricard Winemakers Spain affiliate, based in Spain, and the Pernod Ricard Winemakers Kenwood and Pernod Ricard Winemakers Mumm Napa affiliates, based in the United States. A distinction is made between the Brand Companies and the Market Companies for Australia and New Zealand resulting in two entities for each country.\n\nPernod Ricard's African activities are managed by Pernod Ricard's Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America Region and the related data are therefore included in the data for this Region.\n\nThe social reporting indicators are selected to provide the Group with a reliable and accurate picture of its global footprint. The data collected enables Pernod Ricard to be increasingly socially responsiblein respect ofits employees worldwide.\n\n## Scope of societal reporting\n\nIndicators relating to responsible drinking are included in the social report.The indicators cover all Pernod Ricard affiliates (Brand Companies and Market Companies) that are required to includetheir societal information in the social report, with the exception of certain entities. This is because the roll-out of the S&R strategy and the associated action plans are managed by a sole affiliate when several affiliates are in the same country. These entities donot have to send information to the Group's reporting system.\n\n## Scope of environmental reporting\n\nPernod Ricard's environmental reporting relates to production sites under the Group'soperational control on 30/uni00A0June in the financial year in question and that were operational throughout the year. It does not cover administrative sites (head offices or sales offices) or logistics warehouses when these are located outside industrial sites (this only relates to a few isolated warehouses). This is because their environmental impact is not significant compared to those located within industrial sites. It also covers the agricultural supply chain.\n\nFY21 reporting covers 89/uni00A0industrial sites. This figure is lower than in FY20 following the disposal or closure of two production sites (Paisley in United-Kingdom and Tamaki in New Zealand). The industrial scope taken into account for this financial year therefore covers a production volume of 1,035/uni00A0million litres (finished/uni00A0product either bottled or in bulk), compared with 958/uni00A0million in FY20, and a volume of distilled alcohol of 244/uni00A0million litres in FY21 compared to 232/uni00A0millionlitres in FY20.\n\n## Clarification regarding indicators 3.6.1.2\n\n## Social indicators\n\nAverageheadcount is calculated in terms of full-time equivalents, without taking into account short-term employee absences. Long-term absences involving contract suspensions are taken into account in thecalculation of the FTE.\n\nSince FY19, employees are included in the headcount of the legal entity with which they have an employment contract.Expatriates and seconded employees are included in the headcount of their host affiliates.\n\nPernod Ricard China employees are accounted for as staff on permanent contracts. Chinese employment contracts actually comprise a statutory duration and are only converted into permanent contracts after a number of years. However, given the specific characteristics of employment legislation in China, Pernod Ricard considers its employees to be permanent staff. Due to the particular characteristics of local labour laws, as oflast year the same rule applies to Pernod Ricard Minsk employees, as the concept of fixed-term contract does not exist in Belarus.\n\nWork-study contracts (apprenticeship contracts and training contracts) are not counted as fixed-term contracts, and this also applies to work placement students, temporary workers and/uni00A0VIE programme volunteers.\n\nMaternity/paternity/parental leaves are included in the absenteeism rate.",

        "page_content": "Regarding the Covid-19 crisis, the leave days resulting from governmental restrictions have been excluded from the absenteeism reporting to keep coherence with previous absenteeismrates. However, in some countries, sick leaves have been granted to allow parents to take care of their child having no school - these leaves cannot be differentiated from real sick leaves and have been included. Any absence given by the Company to get vaccinated are also part of the absenteeism, as exceptional motives.\n\nThe absenteeism rate is calculated based on the theoretical number of hours and working days worked per year.\n\nIn FY21, the calculation for lost time accident severity & frequency rates evolved to follow a more commonly used method and ease the reading of these indicators. The number of accidents & the number of subsequent calendar days lost are now used against the annual full time equivalent for both employees & interim workers, and not anymore against the number of days theoretically worked during the year.\n\nAdditionally, and in line with the Group H&S policy, frequency/severity rates for workplace accidents, number of lost time and number of fatalities integrate newly acquired companies only in their second full fiscal year - this year, Drinks&Co Store France, DrinksAndCo Marketplace SLU, Bodeboca, Inverroche, Pernod Ricard Vietnam Spirits & Wines Company Limited, Pernod Ricard Asia Duty Free/uni00A0Ltd/uni00A0- Travel Retail Asia, D&CO Platform Services, New World Liquor have been excluded from these indicators.\n\nCommuting accidents are no longer included in the number of accidents. They are thus not used to calculate frequency and severity rates. Conversely, frequency and severity rates now take into account the number of workplace accidents involving temporary staff (workers employed by a staff agency for a temporary period and directly supervised by Pernod Ricard).\n\nTraining hours completed by employees are recorded, including both face-to-face training and e-learning hours. Employees are only counted as having received training once, regardless of the number of training courses they have attended.\n\nHeadcount and FTE calculations consider employees leaving the group on the last day of the fiscal year as active.The related termination events are then included on the next fiscal to calculate departure rates & turnover.\n\nDefinition for the classification 'Top Management' has been reviewed and reclarified after the FY19 publication. This classificationreflects the employees from COMEX to Band C job levels.\n\n## Environmental indicators\n\nThe Group footprint on agricultural land is assessed by the areas on which purchased agricultural raw materials are used.These equivalent areas are estimated on the basis of the agricultural yields of the various materials used by the Group (exceptfor the agave footprint which is based on accurate land coverage). For transformed products, industrial yields are used to assess the quantities of agricultural materials purchased.\n\nThe environmental performance of sites is expressed using various ratios. These are based on the business category in which the Group has classified the sites:\n\n- distilleries: data broken down by volumes of pure distilled glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> alcohol;\n- wineries: data broken down by volumes made into wine; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- vineyards: data broken down by surface area cultivated with glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> vines.\n\nAt Group level, consolidated performance is expressed based either on:\n\n- the amount of distilled alcohol for environmental impacts glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> primarily due to distillation ( e.g. water or energy consumption), expressed in units per thousand litres of pure distilled alcohol (kl PA);\n- the bottled volume or the volume of finished products glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> manufactured (including products delivered in bulk) when bottling or production is the main source of impact (such as in the case of solid waste), expressed in units per thousand litres (kl);\n- the number of hectares occupied by vineyards for agricultural glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> properties, expressed in units per hectare (ha).\n\nForindustrial sites, this distinction is sometimes complex, as some sites have several activities. As such, since the time frames involved in bottling may sometimes be very different from those for distilling (aged/uni00A0spirits: whiskies, cognac, etc.), these figures may be difficult to interpret from year to year.Both calculation methods are therefore presented for some indicators. Setting overall Group quantitative targetsfor the quantity of water or energy consumed per unit produced, for example, becomes complex as the consolidation of targets depends on the business mix during the year and the consolidated indicator chosen. For that reason, the results expressed by the indicators should be used with care and interpreted over the long term. Where a significant reporting error from previous periods is identified, historical/uni00A0data is only readjusted if the impact on Group performance is greater than 1%. This is to allow for a better interpretation of results and trends.\n\nDefinition for 'renewable energy consumption' and 'renewable electricity consumption' have been reviewed after the FY19 publication in order to respect the RE100 requirements. Since FY20:\n\n- the total renewable electricity consumption is calculated with glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the part covered by green or renewable energy certificates and the amount of renewable electricity produced and used on site;\n- the total renewable energy consumption is calculated with the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> total renewable electricity consumption and the amount of other renewable energy used on site (biogass, biofuel, etc.).\n\nWaterRisk Assessment is realised using Aqueduct WaterRisk Atlas, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI). The Internal Water Risk Index (IWRI) is calculated based on the blended rating from three Aqueduct indicators:\n\n- overall Water Risk; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- baseline Water Stress; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- baseline Water Stress - 2025/uni00A0projected using a 'Business as glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Usual' scenario.\n\nThree waterrisk levels are defined as a result of 'Internal Water Risk Index' analysis:\n\n- extremely high risk, sites with an IWRI higher than 4; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- high risk, sites with an IWRI between 3 and 4; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- mediumrisk, sites with an IWRI between/uni00A02 and/uni00A03; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- low risk, sites with an IWRI lower than/uni00A02. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- bottling sites: data broken down by volumes of bottled finished glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> products;",

The quantities of water replenished through projects in place are consolidated at country-level and for watersheds with same level of risk.\n\nRelated to the Group carbon footprint calculation, FY19 POS materials carbon emissions data/uni00A0have been used for FY21figures.\n\n## Collection, consolidation 3.6.1.3 and/uni00A0monitoring of data\n\n## Data collection methods\n\nTo guarantee the standardisation and reliability of results, non-financial indicators are formalised in reporting procedures. This includes specific definitions of each indicator, which are passed on to all Managers involved in collecting and consolidating data.\n\nPernod Ricard constantly seeks to improve the collection and analysis of its data. It accordingly updates its procedures and user guide each year in line with the Group's evolving needs. Improvements are made to ensure compliance with the requirements of the decree implementing article/uni00A0225 on the transparency obligations of companies regarding social and environmental matters and in accordance with applicable national or international frameworks. The updates also result from contributions from affiliates when reporting data and auditor feedback. Any changes made since the previous year are highlighted.\n\nFor social indicators, a new tool has been created and used to gather and process the data since FY19.\n\nA consolidation tool has been used to gather and process the data for FY21, from local entities. For social indicators, a new tool has been created and used to gather and process the data for FY21.\n\n## Methods for consolidating and checking data\n\nAfter being submitted by entities, data is compiled at management entity level, then at Region or Brand level for submission to Headquarters. The data is processed and consolidated at each level. Each entity collecting and compiling data is responsible for the indicators reported and certifies the data as well as the checks done.\n\nThis control is facilitated by automatic checks within the data entry tool in the consolidation documents sent to the Regions or Brands and in the consolidation tool. Amongst other things, these include consistency checks against previous years and between the indicators themselves. For social indicators, at each step the affiliates can explain any variations versus the previous financial year -/uni00A0for 10% or more variations, a comment is required to facilitate the understanding and tracking.\n\nOnce all the data have been collected, Headquarters performs consistency checks to identify any reporting or input errors. When there are significant variations, the Group checks with the affiliates to ensure the data is valid. Finally, Headquarters consolidates these data.",

As/uni00A0with all control systems, they cannot however provide an absolute guarantee that such risks have been fully eliminated.\n\n## Description of the internal control 4.1.2 environment\n\n## Components of the internal control 4.1.2.1 system\n\nThe principal bodies responsible for internal control are as follows:\n\n## At Group level\n\n- The Executive Board is the permanent coordination body for glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the management of the Group;\n- The Executive Committee ensures that the Group's glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> operations are carried out properly and that its main policies are applied;\n- The Internal Audit Department works under the Group Chief glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Executive Officer and reports to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. The internal audit team based at Headquarters is in chargeofimplementing the audit plan, with/uni00A0the support of the audit teams in the Regions. The audit plan is drawn up once the Group's main risks have been identified and analysed. It is validated by the Executive Board and by the Audit Committee and presents various cross-disciplinary issues that will be reviewed during the financial year, the list of affiliates that will be audited, and/uni00A0the/uni00A0main topics to be covered during the audits.

This questionnaire, which was updated during the financial year, complies with the French Financial Market Authority (AMF) reference framework for risk management and internal control, as does its application guide, itself updated in July/uni00A02010; and\n- performing audits: 25 internal audits were conducted in FY21. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> The purpose of these audits was to ensure that the Group's internal control principles were properly applied in its affiliates. They also allowed to review the processes in place, best practices and potential areas for improvement on various cross-cutting themes. The specificity of this exercise was the setting up of remote audits for most of the assignments carried out.\n\nAll of the key areas for improvement identified were addressed in/uni00A0specific action plans drawn up at every affiliate and at Group level, which were validated by the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. Their implementation is regularly monitored and assessed by the Group'sInternal Audit Department.\n\nThe work performed resulted in an improvement of the quality of internal control and risk management to improve within the Group.",

This identification of the Group's risks, in which Management took an active part, highlighted the Group'sresilience in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, and contributed to the redefinition of the main risk profiles and their management.\n\nCompared to the previous mapping, the main changes that have taken place reflect the impacts of the sanitary crisis (for example regarding the health and safety of people or supply disruptions) as well as changes in the risk assessment (for example due to rapid changes in consumer behaviour). Some risks have seen their impact diminish, taking into account the fact that they are mainly the consequences of the materialisation of other risks in\n\nthis matrix (such as major litigation or harmful media coverage). Lastly, a new risk has been highlighted at the end of the financial year,relating to the growing importance of CSR issues and the Group's desire to make an active contribution in this area.\n\nThis mapping is reproduced below to provide a visual representation of the issues, without replacing the explanatory text that follows.The different risks are classified according to their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. This risk mapping reflects Pernod Ricard's exposure and takes into account the control measures in place to limit the probability and impact. This mapping will be reviewed annually to take into account major changes in the risk environment facing the Group Pernod Ricard.\n\nLIKELYHOOD OF OCCURENCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHIGH",

Within each category, the most important risk factors are presented first.\n\n## Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on/uni00A0Pernod/uni00A0Ricard's key risk factors and/uni00A0outlook 4.2.1\n\nMany of the risks mapped have materialised in one way or another (personal safety, legal restrictions on the sale of alcohol, financial risks) or have required heightened vigilance (cyberattacks, supply disruptions) in the context of the sanitary crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Themain impact of the sanitary crisis lies in the sharp decline in Group sales resulted from the lockdown periods, in particular due to widespread closures in the hospitality and nightclub sector and a sharp fall in/uni00A0air traffic affecting the travel retail business.\n\nSince thestart of the health crisis, and throughout FY21, Pernod Ricard has maintained measures enabling it to:\n\n- protect the health and safety of its employees by rigorously glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> applying the recommendations of local authorities and the World Health Organization (partial shut-down of operations, widespread working from home for staff, rotation of teams, etc.);\n- ensure the continuity of its industrial, commercial and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> logistical operations; and\n- maintain dynamic management of its activity (including the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> management of its resources) in a context of very uncertain outlook depending on the country.",

Geopolitical and macroeconomic instability\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nDue to its international scope, the Group Pernod Ricard is exposed to the risksof geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic instabilities.\n\nThe acceleration of the protectionist trends observed in recent years may lead to an increase in customs barriers, as was the case in the context of the trade conflicts between the United States and China, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other.\n\nIn addition, the global sanitary crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the risk of the resurgence of a global macroeconomic crisis and social unrest.\n\nThese geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions in the Group's markets could lead to heightened volatility in Pernod Ricard's commercial and financial results.\n\nMacroeconomic instability and, in particular, potential constraints on consumer purchasing power, may have a negative impact on consumption opportunities and the Group's sales.\n\nSustained geopolitical tensions could also lead to difficulties in accessing certain markets.\n\nThese economic crises and trade tensions could weigh on the Group's operating margins.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nFor the Group, the best way to protect itself is to diversify its activities, both geographically and by category: it is present in 73/uni00A0countries and has a leading brand in all major spirit categories. Pernod Ricard continues to develop new distribution channels (e-commerce, home entertainment) and to exploit new consumption opportunities, such as the 'low/no alcohol' trend. Accordingly, the Group regularly reassesses its routes-to-market and local partners. In addition, crisis management programmes are in place in all affiliates. Similarly, in certain cases, the Group may increase prices in order to mitigate the impact on margins. Finally, under certaincircumstances, production and logistics infrastructures can be adapted.\n\n## 2. Pressure on prices and margins\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe concentration and consolidation of distributors both locally and internationally has been ongoing for several years. E-commerce is also becoming an increasingly important alternative to traditional distribution channels.This competitive environment affects the Group's ability to increase its prices and may sometimes force Pernod Ricard to organise more aggressive and frequent promotional campaigns.\n\nThe Group also faces heightened competition from both major international players on its strategic brands and local groups or producers on its local brands, driven by the increasing success of craft products, as is the case with vodka in the United States.\n\nLastly, purchase price inflation (materials, services) is closely monitored by the Group in order to limit pressure on margins.\n\nPotential impacts include:\n\n- the increased bargaining power of Pernod Ricard's customers glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> leading to margin erosion and/or loss of market share;\n- temporary delisting of products on shelves and/or removal of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> promotional materials;\n- pressure on Pernod Ricard to align prices across markets glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> within a region;\n- the more intense competition in mature markets and the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> increasingly competitive nature of emerging markets, requiring the Group to boost its advertising and promotional investments, or even to reduce or freeze prices in order to protect market share, thereby weighing on results;\n- damage to the brand image of products, resulting fromprice glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> reductions; and\n- a decrease in margins due to a deterioration in purchasing glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> conditions from the Group's suppliers and/or a limited ability to reflect cost increases in the price of its products.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate risk, Pernod Ricard earmarks approximately 16% of net sales for A&P investments to reinforce brand equity and, in turn, the ability to increase prices. In addition, Pernod Ricard has rolled out several initiatives to boost net sales (Revenue Growth Management), such as the development of a promotional effectiveness tool, the analysis of commercial conditions and pricing structures, and the implementation of dedicated pricing resources.These initiatives are adopted in the affiliates and coordinated at Group level by the Headquarters.\n\nParticular attention is paid to the operating margin, a key indicator monitored by the management control teams. The Group has put in place the appropriate organisations and initiatives to ensure satisfactory purchasing conditions for its raw materials while maintaining relationships ofmutual trust with its key suppliers.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Cyberattack\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe Group's digital transformation has brought with it greater exposure to risks stemming from cyberattacks, as well as those related to IT and telecommunications system failures. These systems are of inestimable importance to the Group's day-to-day operations, in particular regarding processing, transmission and storage of electronic data relating as much to the Group's operations and financial statements, as to the communication between Pernod Ricard's personnel, customers and suppliers.\n\nIn addition, more stringent personal data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation, increase the risks associated with regulatory non-compliance.\n\nPotential impacts of a cyberattack and its effects depend on the nature of the attack, but could include:\n\n- leakage, loss, theft of personal, strategic or confidential data, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and the resulting chain of potential repercussions;\n- system failure; and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- incapacity to perform day-to-day operations. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nAlthoughthe Group invests a significant amount in maintaining and safeguarding its IT systems, particularly in view of growing threats in terms of cybercriminality, any malfunctions, significant disruption, loss or disclosure of sensitive data could disrupt the normal course of business, and have financial, operational or reputational consequences.\n\nLastly, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a spectacular rise in teleworking within the Group, which has shaken up traditional ways of organising work, while at the same time presenting attackers with increased opportunities to launch cyber-attacks.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has drawn up a cybersecurity roadmap based on the establishment of dedicated governance and resources.\n\nThe Group has taken out a 'cyber-insurance' policy and is striving to strengthen the security of its infrastructures, websites and networks. Infrastructure monitoring and management is performed constantly. IT and security audits are regularly performed to assess whether the level of security is adequate; they give the Group a good overview of the reliability of its IT systems. In addition, awareness-raising campaigns are conducted. Lastly, tests are carried out on the recovery of the Group's IT systems following a hypothetical cyberattack, and a plan has been designed to facilitate the recovery of data as efficiently as possible.\n\n## 4. Fast changing consumer behaviors\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nAccentuated by the Covid-19 pandemic, the trend in consumer behaviour has accelerated, in terms of product offerings (artisanal spirits, trend for little or no alcohol), purchasing preferences (e-commerce, fast delivery) or dialogue and brand experiences with (digital marketing, cross-channel points of contact, etc.).\n\nPernod Ricard needs to adapt its organisation, portfolio, business model and market access routes to these new trends and continue to innovate, always placing the consumer at the centre of its decisions and marketing and commercial choices.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTomitigate risk, Pernod Ricard acts across its entire organisation:\n\n- the Consumer Insights organisation studies and improves knowledge of consumer behaviour and societal changes in the Group in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> order to anticipate changes in trends. This was strengthened in 2019 by its centralisation and the creation of relays in the markets as well as by the intensification of social listening resources;\n- innovation hubs have been created in the regions to develop products and services with high added value, both for the Group and for glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> its consumers and users. In addition, an agile TLO experimentation method (Test, Learn, Optimise) has been set up;\n- from a strategic standpoint, the diversification of the business model, market access methods and portfolio management are closely glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> monitored and changes deemed relevant are implemented. For example, the Group entered the direct-to-consumer sales channel with the launch of Drinks&Co, a brand bringing together an online marketplace and physical stores. Moreover, the creation of Conviviality Ventures in 2017 also makes it possible to invest indirectly in new activities that complement those of Pernod Ricard by benefiting from the rich and innovative start-up ecosystem;\n- finally, the Group continues its in-depth digital transformation. The six transformation priorities have been brought together in Key glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Digital Programmes. They make it possible to continuously improve the effectiveness of marketing and sales processes and to identify the maximum opportunities in the relationships that are established with the various partners through incubated programmes. These programmes are based on the in-depth exploitation of data and the latest available technologies such as machine learning algorithms.\n\nDifficulties in detecting and predicting future consumer behaviour could result in under-investment in categories, products and channels that turn out to be strong or conversely over-investment in those that are running out of steam.\n\nOver time, Pernod Ricard could lose market share or miss out on growth opportunities and damage its brand image and/or reputation.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

        "page_content": "5. Talent management/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nPernod Ricard's success depends on the commitment of its employees and its ability to attract and retain them as well as develop their skills, particularly in highly competitive labour markets, such as Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, where turnover rates are higher than in the rest of the world. This competitive talent market is heightened by the search for scarce skills (such as digital skills) and by changes in the aspirations of new generations. Moreover, employee development through geographic mobility is a key issue (diversity of career paths, management of the partner's career, cost control, etc.).\n\nThe Group is aware that talent management must remain an area of long-term vigilance to ensure the sustainability of the business and ensure the transmission of key know-how within the organisation. Excessively high turnover or unduly long job vacancies could have a financial impact and demotivate teams. This could potentially slow the implementation of key Group development projects and have an adverse impact on its business, results or reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTomitigate risk, the Group has established an ambitious skills development policy facilitating dynamic career management. Accordingly, shared processes and tools have been developed to allow all affiliates to optimise the assessment of skillsand performance, to formalise the detection of talents, to encourage internal mobility and to monitor employee satisfaction. Since 2019, atalent management system, based on a leadership model with expected behaviours at each level, has been put in place (Let's Talk Talent). Shared by the whole Group, this system puts the employee at the centre of Human Resources processes and clarifies performance expectations, using a common language for everyone. Moreover, Pernod Ricard University trains the Group's future leaders through leadership development courses. Succession plans are regularly reviewed by the Top Management, especially for key positions within the Group. Lastly, measures are carried out regularly to improve quality of life at work. They include the facilitation of remote work, measures related to well-being at work, the modernisation of workspaces and managerial awareness-raising programmes.\n\n## 6. Negative media coverage\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe constant increase in the number of social networks, thespeed of circulation of information and its influence, mean that the Group could face the risk of being exposed to harmfulmedia coverage and inappropriate publications or messages. Furthermore, the prolonged spread of misleading information in the media and in particular on social networks (fake news) has been observed in recent years. It cannot be ruled out that the Group Pernod Ricard could be affected by this type of action, which isdifficult to control.\n\nA malicious attack aimed at harming the Group's reputation or a genuine incident in relation to Pernod Ricard brands could have a significant impact on the Group's image and reputation. Further widespread negative media coverage could jeopardise consumers' confidence in Pernod Ricard brands, resulting in a potential sales decline.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe Group'srisk is managed through a series of internal and external measures. While internal measures focus primarily on raising the awareness of Pernod Ricard employees of the impact of social media and sharing best practices in terms of communication, external measures are used to monitor social media and promote the Group's CSR activities.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Supply chain disruptions\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nWhile the global crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic has shown the resilience of the Group Pernod Ricard's supply chain, it has also shown that large-scale, unpredictable events could occur and render access to markets more complex. Other factors also remain relevant, such as the failure of a key supplier, the unavailability of certain raw materials (weather conditions, in particular) or theclosure or impossibility of access to certain routes, whether sea or land. By way of illustration, a trend towards the concentration of suppliers of raw materials and packaging has been observed for a number of years. Today, many of the Group's affiliates work with the same suppliers, which creates risk-charged interdependence should one of themfail ( e.g. in the event of a major accident at one of their production sites).\n\nA breakdown in the supply chain could occur due to the unavailability of certain raw materials or packaging materials, causing production of some of the Group's products to be shut down.\n\nFurthermore, the unavailability of certain products on the shelves, for one or more of the reasons mentioned here, could result in penalties invoiced by the Group's customers for non-compliance with the commercial terms and conditions and service rates agreed between the parties.\n\nLastly, an unexpected rise in the cost of raw materials or packaging materials could significantly increase the Group's operating costs. As it is not certain that this increase can be offset by higher prices, the Group's results could be affected.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nAs part of the business continuity measures put in place for the Group's strategic brands, affiliates systematically identify supply alternatives whenever there is a risk of a single supplier. These alternatives are also tested to ensure the viability of these choices. In addition, to mitigate other scenarios taken into account in these business continuity plans (such as the loss of a storage site or transport difficulties), emergency stocks are planned and taken into account on a permanent basis in the supply and production decisions of Brand Companies and Market Companies.\n\nLastly, the reinforcement of the 'S&OP' process, supported by the rollout of IT tools, gives better visibility concerning future demand and associated supply plans. In this context, more detailed planning ofneeds - at the level of the Brand Companies in particular - makes it possible to secure supply volumes from key suppliers and facilitate allocation decisions for the various markets if necessary.\n\n## 8. S&R challenges\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nPernod Ricard places the responsibility and sustainability of its activities at the heart of its strategy and decisions. In this context, an ambitious roadmap for 2030, called Good Times From a Good Place, was rolled out in 2019. Structured around natural resources and key stakeholders for the Group, this strategy has four pillars ('Nurturing terroir', 'Valuing People', 'Acting Circular' and 'Responsible Hosting') for each of which quantitative and qualitative objectives have been defined.\n\nAll of these commitments represent real challenges that the Group is intent upon tackling, in line with its historical approach and the expectations of its stakeholders, in particular consumers, employees and shareholders.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe Group has built a solid governance around the issues of responsibility and sustainability. At the level of the Board of Directors, a CSR Committee ensures that Pernod Ricard's roadmap and commitments are monitored. In addition, at operational level, a steering committee meets four times a year to ensure that the resources are put in place to achieve the objectives. Pernod Ricard is also setting up key partnerships to reinforce the implementation of the strategy. Finally, reporting and monitoring tools covering all indicators in all Group affiliates make it possible to verify the Group's progress and the alignment of all functions involved in achieving these goals.\n\nFailure to meet these objectives or the occurrence of an event in conflict with our commitments (such as an industrial accident) would damage the credibility and reputation that the Group has built up over recent years with its stakeholders, in addition to the direct consequences.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Fraud\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is exposed to the risks of fraud, notably due to its presence in a wide range of countries as well as its accelerating digitalisation, and to constantly evolving threats (cyber-attacks, criminal organisations, etc.).\n\nFrom theft to cybercriminality, any type of occurrence could lead to financial losses (including legal costs to recover defrauded sums and products), leakage of sensitive information or theft of major physical assets. It could also have asignificant impact on the Group's reputation.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Group Pernod Ricard has implemented training measures ( e.g. the online course on internal control) to raise fraud awareness among Pernod Ricard employees. In addition, a strong internal control framework - relying on the Group internal control principles and related tools - has been set up across the Group to limit the risk of occurrence. Further, the Group conducts internal and external audits each year to ensure the effectiveness of measures in place.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks II.\n\n1. Loss of a major industrial site/strategic inventory\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nToday, the main identified causes that could result in the loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory are:\n\n- a fire and/or explosion related to the manufacture and handling glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> of flammable products ( e.g. alcohol);\n- a natural catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane or flood; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and\n- a malicious act. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nSeveral Group sites are located in seismic zones, particularly in NewZealand, Armenia, California and Mexico.\n\nCertain sites, including the San Jos\u00e9 plant in Cuba, are exposed to risk of cyclones.\n\nLastly, the Group has significant stock of ageing products, such as Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, cognac, rum, brandy and wines, which are highly flammable.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTo manage this risk, an Operations Risk Manager reporting to the Operations Department is responsible for coordinating the actions of affiliates in the implementation of preventive measures (design and maintenance of facilities, training, operating procedures, etc.) and physical protection mechanisms (automatic extinguishing, retention basins, emergency procedures, etc.).\n\nIn cooperation with the insurer, more than 40 industrial sites are reviewed each year, resulting in an appraisal of the quality of risk, and as such, recommendations for improvement for each.\n\nIn addition, a Group monitoring programme for business continuity and management systems is in place. Strategic affiliates have identified the various scenarios that could affect their operations and have drawn up business continuity plans including the implementation of emergency solutions and access to alternative means of production in the event of the loss of a site.\n\nThe loss of a major industrial site or strategic inventory is considered a major risk forPernod Ricard. The materialisation of this risk could result in a significant operating loss and as such a sharp drop or prolonged interruption in the supply of certain products, thereby preventing the Group from meeting consumer demand.\n\nMoreover, an incident at one of the sites, whether accidental or the result of a malicious act, could jeopardise the safety of Group employees or could cause environmental damage.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Toxic contamination/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe Group purchases most raw materials (grapes, cereals, agave, etc.) used in the manufacture of its wines & spirits from farmers or industrial producers (alcohol, sugar, flavourings, etc.). The presence of undesirable substances in these raw materials or a defect in the distillation, fermentation or bottling process could result in the presence of chemical (contaminant), biological (microorganism), physical (foreign body) or allergen contamination.\n\nThe Group's reputation and image may be undermined at any time by one-off incidents at an industrial facility or relating to a specific product. For example, contamination, whether arising accidentally, or through an act of malice, could cause injury or intoxication to a consumer, thereby exposing the Group to litigation and causing business and/or reputational harm to brands.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe Group has implemented protection and control systems to limit the risk of contamination. The control of this risk is based both on the application of the HACCP method, whichaims at identifying the risks involved in the manufacturing process and to bring them under control, as well as on the implementation of specific internal guidelines. This approach is also accompanied by the implementation of management systems compliant with the ISO/uni00A022000/uni00A0standard for food safety management, which is aimed specifically at controlling such risk.\n\nThe Group conducts a programme of in-depth analyses covering all contaminants deemed possible. In 2019 and 2020, it focused on all Strategic International Brands and the biggest Strategic Local Brands.\n\nAn operation to detect contaminants, covering all Strategic International Brands and the most important Strategic Local Brands, is/uni00A0periodically conducted by the Group's head office.It consists of an array of chemical analyses covering all the contaminants considered possible, and involves detection testing foraround 40 unwanted molecules plus several hundred pesticides.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Climate change and environmental damage/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nGiven the nature of Pernod Ricard's business, climate change and related risks are a major concern:\n\n- on the one hand, the climate impacts the Group's activities in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> several ways: threats to the supply of raw materials such as grapes and grain, risks related to the management of water resources (flooding, drought); and\n- on theother hand, potential damage can be caused by Pernod glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Ricard (CO2 emissions, accidental pollution).\n\nIncreasingly irregular crop yields, climate events such as frost, hail and drought and shifting climatic boundaries can affect the quality, availability and, to a greater extent, the price of raw materials.\n\nWhere grains are concerned, this effect, coupled with rising global demand, is contributing to increasing volatility of market prices, which must be taken into account in procurement strategies and economic supply models.\n\nAs regards grapes - another of the Group's key raw materials climate models point to an increase in alcohol content in wine and champagne, changes to certain qualitative parameters and change in phytosanitary pressure, as well as the risk of frost or drought, which vary depending on geography.\n\nAsimilar risk exists in relation to the water supply for production sites: a number of sites use underground water tables for their supplyand these can also beaffected by climate change.\n\nFrom a regulatory point of view, environmental issues, and in particular climate-related issues, are leading to stricter regulations on carbon emissions. In Europe, the Group's four largest distilleries are subject to the European Union carbon emission trading system (EU-ETS). The direct financial challenge is moderate for Pernod Ricard but can be expected to increase significantly in the years to come. The economic impact of regulations on energy and carbon is also felt through indirect consumption via the Group's suppliers (especially with respect to glass, alcoholand transport).\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nFor grapes, the relevant inter-professional organisations, such as those for cognac and champagne and the corresponding organisations for wine in Australia and New Zealand, have incorporated this issue into their research programmes in order to adapt their practices to the changes (choice of grape varieties, vine training, vinification, etc.).\n\nThe availability and quality of waterat the production sites are key factors in ensuring the quality ofPernod Ricard's products and are monitored very closely. Responsible water management is a significant component of the Group's environmental policy: each site has to ensure that the use of groundwater or river water and the release of wastewater back into the environment do not harm nature. Sites located in areas identified as high risk in terms of water supply are subject to enhanced monitoring so as to ensure the sustainability of resources used by minimising water consumption and recharging the equivalent volume of water in the same area from which it is taken.\n\nAs for the financial impact related to CO2 emissions generated directly by the Group's activities or indirectly by its suppliers, a CO2 emission reduction plan has been put in place, aligned with a scenario ofless than 2\u00b0C.\n\nIn addition, Pernod Ricard's impact on the climate was taken into account in the definition of the 'Preserve to share' roadmap. In/uni00A0concrete terms, the 'Nurturing terroir' and 'Acting Circular' pillars involve the Company in the following areas:\n\n- biodiversity: by 2030, 100% of the Group's affiliates worldwide will have a strategic biodiversity project that will address the most glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> pressing local issues;\n- regenerative agriculture: by 2025, pilot regenerative agriculture programmes will be developed by the Group for vineyards in eight glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> wine-growing regions/uni00A0- Argentina, California, the Cognac region, Champagne, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and China/uni00A0- aiming to replicate natural processes and improve the quality of soils, watersheds and ecosystems;\n- packaging and waste: elimination of single-use plastic promotional items in 2021 and 100% of packaging to be recyclable, compostable, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> reusable or bio-sourced by 2025; and\n- the balance of water resources and the carbon footprint: by 2030, offset of 100% of the consumption of production sites located in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> watersheds under high water stress, by replenishing water resources in these regions, and a 50% reduction in the carbon intensity of/uni00A0the Group's activities, in line with the Science-Based Targets initiative.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Health and safety (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nPreventing and managing occupational risks is something the Companyowesits employees.\n\nThe notion of 'occupational risk' can be defined as all threats to the health of employees encountered in the context of their professional activity. They may result in an accident or a so-called 'occupational' illness. A non-exhaustive list of occupational risks Pernod Ricard is committed to preventing is as follows:\n\n- risks relating to noise and vibrations; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- electrical risk; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- fire and explosion risk; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- road risk; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- risksrelating totheuse of certain machines or work equipment; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and\n- psychosocial risks. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nIn addition to these traditional risks related to the industrial environment and work in a company, the Covid-19 pandemic may have affected the physical and mental health of Group employees. Despite the implementation of demanding health protocols and the compliance with isolation and quarantine measures, some employees contracted the disease. In addition, repeated lockdowns and prolonged periods of work from home have created disruption to social links and affected the work-life balance.\n\nPersonal injury is one of the main potential impacts for the Group.\n\nThe most serious potential impacts are:\n\n- the death of one or more employees, subcontractors, visitors glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> or other third parties;\n- permanent disability of employees, subcontractors, visitors or glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> other third parties; and\n- occupational illness. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nReputational impact related to inadequate management of working conditions must also be taken into account.\n\nThe active and widespread circulation of a virus such as Covid-19 could lead to repeated absences due to illness, the implementation of home working measures or the temporary stoppage of certain sites leading to potential production losses for the Group.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe Group has embarked on a process to reduce workplace accidents by launching a comprehensive inventory of industrial sites with the greatest potential for improvement at the end of 2017. The main sites are now assessed by an external company in accordance with specific criteria in terms of both the safety culture and the ISO/uni00A045001 'Occupational Healthand Safety' management system.\n\nBuilding on this overview and the commitment of senior management, the Group has signalled its goal of becoming leader in 2025 in the Wine & Spirits sector in terms of Health and Safety. This goal is embodied in a programme knownas 'Taking care of each other', built on the following three strategic pillars:\n\n- develop a culture where safety is central to the Group's values of conviviality; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- engage, motivate and empower all employees and subcontractors on the issue of safety; and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- improve our operational efficiency through excellence in Health and Safety. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nThis programme, which is closely monitored by the Group's Top Management, is part of the Group's CSRstrategy and has gradually been extended to all affiliates.\n\nFinally, the protection of the Health and Safety of its employees lies at the heart of the Group's decisions by rigorously applying the recommendations of local authorities and those of the World Health Organization. Several initiatives have been put in place, in affiliates and at head office, to prevent psychosocial risks linked to prolonged isolation in the context of a pandemic, such as:\n\n- dedicated mental health hotlines; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- partnerships with medical centres; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- virtual moments of conviviality through fun activities (dancing, cooking); and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- strict rules regarding over-connection and meeting and working hours. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Business ethics/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nPernod Ricard is a decentralised company present in 73/uni00A0countries where anti-bribery laws apply with potential extraterritorial effect.\n\nExamples include the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act or France's Sapin/uni00A0II law.The Group is thus required to take into account and rigorously monitor the risk of corruption and influence peddling, as well as to ensure such risks are taken into account in all relevant legal systems, in all regions of the world in which it operates.\n\nMoreover, Company employees interact, even to a marginal extent, with political and administrative officials. The nature of Pernod Ricard's activity (production of wines & spirits enjoyed during a meal or in a bar), for which the motto is 'Cr\u00e9ateurs de convivialit\u00e9', means that inappropriate invitations could be issued to people in a position of public authority as part of a lobbying effort.\n\nRecent regulations concerning the fight against corruption, influence peddling and compliance with business ethics expose Pernod Ricard to the risk of administrative and criminal sanctions, as well as a reputational risk in the event of non-compliance.\n\nIn addition, certain corrupt practices, consisting in offering undue, excessive and/or inappropriate benefits, even without deliberate intention to obtain an undue advantage, are severely punished by the anti-corruption laws of three of the main countries in which the Group operates and provide for the criminal liability of the legal entities and natural and moral persons involved, accompanied in particular by heavy financial penalties for the Company as well as for the perpetrators of such practices.\n\nReputational damage resulting from a judicial conviction or breach of the rules could damage the Company's overall credibility, and an illicit or reprehensible act, even on a single occasion, could negatively impact all Group employees seeking to deliver a message to public authorities.This could in turn limit the Company's ability to legally influence laws that are harmful to its business. It could also result in regulatory developments harming the Company's business (tax increases, marketing restrictions, etc.).\n\nAs a result, these regulations could together result in a significant increase in financial expense or a reduction in the Group's activities.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard has conducted a mapping of the specific risks linked to corruption and influence peddling in order to identify and manage corruption and influence peddling risks inherent to the Group's activities and specific to production and distribution processes, as well as cross-functional risks. The Group is also committed to promoting a 'zero tolerance'policy through a clear discourse by the Group's Management and relayed by the local management in affiliates. Specific rules for employees and stakeholders have been put in place. These are set out in the Group's Code of Business Conduct, which includes a mandatory online course for all employees in order to better understand the potential risks of corruption and influence peddling and the behaviours to adopt in order to prevent them. Pernod Ricard has also acquired digital tools to support its compliance initiatives: Speak Up, a global system for reporting behaviours that are contrary to the Code ofBusiness Conduct; Gifted!, an app dedicated to the declaration and validation of gifts and invitations; Partner Up, platform for assessing the risk of corruption and influence peddling of third parties with which the Group may work.\n\nIn line with the development of legislation on these subjects and the expectations of stakeholders, the Group is also working on Human Rights and environmental issues. Since 2015, Blue Source, a mandatory process for all Pernod Ricard direct procurement, has been rolled out. This aims to ensure the integrity of the Group's partners in these areas and supports them in implementing action plans when necessary.Potential partners assessed as not meeting the standards set are not selected to support the Group in its activities.\n\nFinally, the Group's lobbying policy is governed by the Code of Business Conduct, which contains very specific provisions to prevent any reprehensible practices, whether unintended or otherwise.In France, Pernod Ricard files a disclosure statement with the HATVP/uni00A0 (2) , the/uni00A0High Authority for Transparency in Public/uni00A0 (3) Life and is a member of Transparency International's Forum des entreprises engag\u00e9es . The Group is also a joint signatory of a best practice guide on parliamentary lobbying expenditure published by Transparency International.\n\n- Note that this risk is also covered in Section 3.4 of the Non-Financial Information Statement.

Taxes and levies/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nAs an international player in the Wine & Spirits sector , the Group is very sensitive to changes in indirect taxation, in particular customs duties and excise duties on alcoholic beverages, such as the temporary customs duties introduced by the US government in 2019 on imports of singlemalt Scotch Whiskey or Spanish wines, followed by duties on certain categories of Cognac in 2021 (transatlantic dispute known as Airbus/Boeing, where the US measures consisted of commercial retaliation to European subsidies for the aerospace industry).\n\nThe Group is also exposed to possible changes in tax regulations, in particular concerning direct taxation, in the countries in which it operates, notably at the instigation of the OECD, the European Union or national governments (including tax rates), and accounting policies and standards.\n\nLastly, Pernod Ricard may be subject to tax audits in several countries, and there is no guarantee that the tax authorities will validate the positions taken by the Group, even if the Group deems them to be correct and reasonable in view of its operations.\n\nAn increase in import taxes and excise duties or a change in laws relative to duty free sales could result in an increase in the price of the Group's products and a reduction in the consumption of its Wine & Spirits brands or an increase in the Group's costs, thereby affecting the Group's financial position and operating profit. Nevertheless, this risk is qualified by the size of advertising and promotional investment which can, in certain cases, limit the impact on consumption of an increase in prices.\n\nOther changes in tax regulations could also have a material impact on the Group's results, such as an increase in the corporate tax rate in the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nLastly, in the event that the tax authorities successfully challenge the Group on any material positions, the Group may be subject to additional tax liabilities that may have an adverse effect on the Group's financial position if they are not covered by provisions or if they otherwise trigger a cash payment.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe Group has a tax policy based on compliance with applicable laws and regulations, sound conduct and proactive and efficient tax management. It involves the rejection of all artificial arrangements, theapplication of a transfer pricing policy based on the arm's length principle, efficient organisation of the tax function within the Group and a transparent attitude towards the tax authorities.\n\nVery often, when the Group is confronted with increases in customs duties that affect the entire wine & spirits industry in a given country, the authorities of the exporting country provide their diplomatic support to resolve the problem. As a result, European governments have opened a dialogue with the US government to eliminate customs duties arising from the Airbus/Boeing dispute. This action led to the ending ofall customs duties concerned in the spring of 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's diversification in terms of geographies and product categories mitigates the potential impact of tax risks.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Anti-alcohol environment and regulations (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe Group's businesses throughout the world are subject to a growing number of regulations. Regulatory decisions and changes in legal and regulatory systems could have adverse impacts on Pernod Ricard's business, particularly in the areas of advertising and promotions, labelling and access to distribution.\n\nIn almost all countries in the world, the production, import/export and sale and distribution of alcohol are subject to special regulations. These are constantly changing. Likewise, the presentation or labelling, advertising and promotion of alcoholic products are subject to increasingly strict regulations, the aim of which is often to better inform consumers about the risks of inappropriate alcohol use and sometimes even reduce their alcohol consumption.\n\nThe religious, cultural and media context of each country leads to wide variation in the regulation of alcoholic beverages. In general, there is a movement towards greater constraints on this type of product, its promotion or its distribution.\n\nRegulatory decisions and changes in legal and regulatory requirements in these areas could have a negative impact on Pernod Ricard's business:\n\n- advertising and promotions : regulatory authorities in the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> countries in which the Group trades could impose restrictions on advertising for alcoholic beverages ( e.g. television advertising or sponsorship of sports events). One effect of these limitations would be to prevent or restrict the Group's ability to retain or recruit consumers for its brands in a challenging competitive environment. Restrictions on advertising freedom could also constrain the Group's ability to launch new innovations. They thus have a significant impact on the Group's business;\n- labelling : changes to labelling requirements for alcoholic glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> beverages could diminish the appeal of these products for consumers, who might switch to other less tightly regulated products, resulting in a decline in sales. Furthermore, such changes could have the consequence of increasing costs, thereby affecting the Group's results; and\n- access to distribution : government authorities in countries in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> which the Group operates may seek to restrict consumer access to the Group's products. For example, the prohibition of alcohol in Bihar (India) led to the cessation of Pernod Ricard's activities in that State. Likewise, restrictions on channels, hours or points of sale are occurring regularly in many countries. These restrictions tend to shift consumption to illegal or parallel distribution channels, which compete with the Group's lawful business.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nPernod Ricard actively participates in public debates relating to the adoption of laws and regulations that affect the Group. The Company's teams promote the Group's positions and solutions to local decision-makers and legislators. Pernod Ricard does this through professional bodies to which it belongs, or directly when the subject specifically concerns the Group.\n\nPernod Ricard is also committed to ensuring that the products distributed are promoted responsibly and in line with the ethical marketing or commercial standards agreed within the International Alliance for Responsible Drinking (IARD). Internal controls are in place to ensure compliance with the Pernod Ricard Commercial Communication Code, which includes all the rules to which marketing communications are subject.\n\nIn line with its CSR ambitions, Pernod Ricard also wants to be part of the players who are proactively changing legislation and practices, by promoting alternatives to exclusively repressive solutions to treat alcohol abuse and which have not proven their effectiveness. Currently, more than 150 initiatives to prevent the dangers of abusive or inappropriate consumption are developed by the Group worldwide, alone or with partners. From 2021, a pictogram 'prohibited to minors', as well as a pictogram on the risk of excessive alcohol consumption while driving, will be affixed to all bottles produced by the Group's brands, three years ahead of the initial schedule (insofar as the regulations in the country where they are sold allow it).\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Major litigation\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nLike other companies in the Wine & Spirits sector, the Group may be the subject of legal action or other litigation and complaints from consumers or government authorities. In addition, the Group routinely faces litigation inthe normal course of business.\n\nThe Group records provisions for all disputes in which it is involved and all risks it faces. At 30/uni00A0June 2021, these provisions totalled \u20ac366/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac431/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2020 (see Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nMajor litigation of any type could have an adverse impact on the Group's financial position (in the event of a fine or damages), or the Group's image and reputation due to media coverage and posts on social networks, and may result in the loss of rights, in particular intellectual property rights (in the event of the cancellation of a trademark).\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nTo avoid litigation, the Legal Department, in charge of the Group's protection and defence, has implemented preventive measures. Marketing and operational teams are made aware of legal issues on an ongoing basis, model agreements are made available, and the legal teams provide support in the very early stages of projects. Legal functions have been established at the regional and local levels to ensure better local monitoring. Furthermore, a quarterly report listing the major risks identified by local legal teams, particularly with regard to compliance, counterfeiting, cyberattack, personal data and potential major disputes is sent to staff at head office, who are responsible for coordination.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Counterfeiting/IP rights\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe Group's brands are one of the key aspects of its competitiveness. However, they face various threats: unauthorised reproduction, imitation, use of signs likely to create confusion in the mind of the public, refilling of bottles with counterfeit liquids. These issues remain crucial in various markets, and could pose serious threats to consumers, including endangering their health. In addition, the increasing sophistication of techniques for unauthorised reproduction of the Group's products can lead to difficulties in authenticating them.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, illegal traders are actively seeking to take advantage of the measures put in place to combat the spread of the virus. The closure of on-trade premises and some official retail outlets, combined with legislation prohibiting the production, import, distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages in certain countries, has triggered a shift to online demand (a distribution channel increasingly used by counterfeiters), as well as a resurgence of black market activity. This is of particular concern in India and South Africa.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe protection and defence of the Group's intellectual property rights is based on a triangular organisation established to maximise desired efficiency while minimising costs.\n\nFirst component: at the end of 2014, the Group set up a centralised team (the 'Group Intellectual Property Hub') dedicated notably to protecting the brands. This team ensures the protection of rights and defends them against any attempt by third parties to file similar rights in order to avoid confusion among consumers and the undermining or dilution of the Group's brands.\n\nSecond component: the Brand Companies are in charge of proceedings brought against any counterfeit goods and/or imitations that maybepresent in the markets.\n\nThird component: a Brand Security team leads the fight against illicit trade in the Group's products globally by coordinating all action taken against counterfeiting and other forms of trafficking. This action takes the form of investigations on the ground or online, and legal action combined with initiatives to raise awareness among local authorities. In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Brand Security team has stepped up its general monitoring of online sales platforms and social media. Many counterfeiting production facilities have also been dismantled with the help of local authorities, particularly in India and China. Lobbying has also been undertaken jointly with the Public Affairs teams and the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) to raise government awareness of the impact of measures taken on illicit trade during the lockdown. Lastly, the Brand Security team is also involved in the development of technical/technological measures to improve the protection of the Group's products. Examples of such measures include a scheme based on the principle of the smart bottle, introduced in strategic markets such as China, which enables consumers to check the authenticity of the Group's products using a QR code integrated into the packaging. In addition, a platform identifying local legislation that could encourage illicit trade was set up in conjunction with industry stakeholders to identify high-risk regions and take the necessary action during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe defence of intellectual property rights also involves operational staff, who are called on to identify imitations (products/brands) in/uni00A0the field and to pass on all necessary information to the aforementioned teams for action.\n\nFraudulent use of the Group's brands damages its image and reputation and impacts its development prospectsand results, and could cause consumers to shun the Group's products if their reliability is not guaranteed (in the case of refills) or if third parties deliberately create confusion with the Group's brands (brand imitation). It also increases operating costs.\n\nWhile avenues forlegal recourse are generally satisfactory, it may be difficult in some countries to obtain swift and dissuasive sanctions against counterfeiters.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

They are subject to risk management policies and procedures put in place to measure and manage them and reduce their occurrence or impact.\n\nIn an economic context that remains uncertain and in order to manage the liquidity risk that may result from the repayment of financial liabilities at their contractual maturity, Pernod Ricard has taken precautionary measures to ensure sufficient liquidity to meet its needs and continues to diversify its sources of financing, thereby limiting dependence on various lenders.\n\nThus, the Group anticipated the refinancing of a portion of its Bonds in US dollars in October/uni00A02020 (issuance and early redemption of existing Bonds in US dollars via the exercise of the\n\n## 1.

The resulting net foreign exchange exposures are hedged by the use of forward transactions.\n\nResidual risk may be partially hedged by the use of financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) intended to hedge highly probable receivables or payables or to secure the receipt of dividends.\n\nForasset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural hedging.\n\n## 2.

Credit risk/uni00A0 (1)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nCredit risk for the Group is dominated by the risk of financial loss stemming from a default (cash flow difficulties or liquidation) among customers indebted to a Group affiliate. Although the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic have severely affected some of the Group's customers/uni00A0in particular those operating in the hospitality and nightclub sectors/uni00A0- the rate of non-recovery of receivables remained extremely low.\n\nThe non-recovery of a commercial receivable in the event of non-payment or liquidation of customers would have a negative impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nThe diversity and multiplicity of the Group's distribution network, spread over many countries, and the diversification of the main customers from the large retail sector, limit its exposure.\n\nMoreover, internal procedures are in place to assess the financial health of the Group's customers and adapt credit terms and activity as appropriate.\n\nLastly, risk of this nature is limited by the subscription of credit insurance with the standard guarantees. The Group'srisk hedging policy is based on the partial transfer of risk to insurers.\n\n## 4. Pensions/uni00A0 (2)\n\n## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION\n\n## POTENTIALIMPACTSONTHEGROUP\n\nThe Group's unfunded pension obligations amounted to \u20ac477/uni00A0million as of 30/uni00A0June 2021. During FY21, the Group's contributions to pension plans totalled \u20ac63/uni00A0million.\n\nThe Group's pension obligations are for the most part covered by balance sheet provisions and partially covered by pension funds or insurance. The amount of these provisions is based on certain actuarial assumptions, including, for example, discounting factors, demographic trends, pension trends, future salary trends and expected returns on plan assets.\n\nThe asset/liability balance is subject to, among other factors, the/uni00A0performance of invested assets. A liquidity crisis or major financial shock could significantly undermine the performance of financial assets and jeopardise the asset/liability balance. A/uni00A0pronounced asset/liability imbalance may require an increase in the Group's pension liabilities recognised in the balance sheet and result in an increase in the allowance for retirement provisions. This could have a significant negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\n## RISK CONTROLANDMITIGATION\n\nSpecific governance and a management policy have been implemented and are regularly reviewed in line with the risk profile of the Group's various pension plans. The investment strategy is subject to frequent review in order to minimise the volatility of assets.\n\nThe buy-in transaction achieved for the largest of the Group's Pension Fund in September/uni00A02019 is a concrete example of the active derisking strategy. The Fund's Trustee has purchased an insurance policy from a highly rated and well established insurance company to cover the majority of the pensions obligations. The insurance policy therefore reduces the Group's exposure on that Fund to funding deficits arising from market risks, including inflation and interest rate risks, and longevity risks.\n\nIn addition, defined benefit plans (mainly affiliates in North America, the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe) are subject to an annual actuarial valuation on the basis of country-specific assumptions.\n\nNote/uni00A04.9 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNote/uni00A04.7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Premiumisation was strong, thanks to the growth of StrategicInternational Brands and Specialty Brands.Pernod Ricard gained market share in most key markets.\n\nThe transformation momentum is powerful, with significant investments in priority brands and markets, good progress in digital transformation, fast growth in e-commerce (+63%) and the acceleration of the Sustainability & Responsibility 2030 roadmap.\n\nPerformance was excellent and resource management dynamic: the +213/uni00A0bps improvement in the operating margin was significant. Cash performance was exceptional: the Net debt/EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.6x.\n\nThe Transform & Accelerate strategy launched in 2018 produced significant results. The consumer trends that underpinned this strategy are now more relevant than ever.As a result, Pernod Ricard is continuing its transformation to become The Conviviality Platform. This strategy aims to maximise long-term value creation, with the following medium-term ambition (in a normalised context):\n\n- Embeddynamicgrowth and deliver operating leverage: glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- net sales growth of between +4% and +7%, leveraging glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> competitive advantages and continuous investment behind key priorities,\n- special attention to the price effect and operational glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> excellence initiatives,\n- maintaining a high level of advertising and promotional glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> spend of around 16% of net sales, with strong decisions to support priority brands and markets, while stimulating innovation,\n- s tructural cost discipline, making it possible to invest in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> priorities while maintaining an agile organisation, with growth below that of net sales,\n- improvement in the operating margin of around 50-60/uni00A0bps glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> per year, as soon as net sales are in the +4% to +7% range;\n- Financial policy priorities, while maintaining an investment glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> grade rating, are:\n- i nvestment in future organic growth, in particular through glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> strategic stocks and capex,\n- continued active portfolio management, including glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> value-creating M&A transactions,\n- dividend pay-out ratio of around 50% of Net profit from glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> recurring operations,\n- share buyback programme (which will resume in FY22). glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\nA detailed presentation of thestrategy will take place during a Capital Market Day in FY22.\n\n## Presentation of results 5.2.1\n\n## Groupnet profit per share from recurring operations - diluted 5.2.1.1\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                                                                                              | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Profit from recurring operations                                                                                         | 2,260        | 2,423        |\n| Financial income/(expense) from recurring operations                                                                     | (328)        | (262)        |\n| Corporate income tax on recurring operations                                                                             | (468)        | (526)        |\n| Net profit from discontinued operations, non-controlling interests and share of net profit from/uni00A0equity associates | (25)         | (24)         |\n| GROUP NET PROFIT FROM RECURRING OPERATIONS/uni00A0 (1)                                                                   | 1,439        | 1,612        |\n| GROUP NET PROFIT PER SHARE FROM RECURRING OPERATIONS - DILUTED (\u20ac)                                                       | 5.45         | 6.16         |\n\n## Profit from recurring operations 5.2.1.2\n\nGroup\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                  | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   | Reported growth   | Reported growth   | Organic growth (1)   | Organic growth (1)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Net sales                                    | 8,448        | 8,824        | 376               | 4%                | 810                  | 10%                  |\n| Gross margin after logistics expenses        | 5,086        | 5,293        | 206               | 4%                | 550                  | 11%                  |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           | (1,327)      | (1,393)      | (66)              | 5%                | (116)                | 9%                   |\n| Contribution after advertising and promotion | 3,759        | 3,900        | 141               | 4%                | 434                  | 12%                  |\n| PROFIT FROM RECURRING OPERATIONS             | 2,260        | 2,423        | 163               | 7%                | 415                  | 18%                  |",

        "page_content": "## Recent developments 5.5\n\nOn 31 August 2021, the Group entered into an agreement to acquire a minority stakein Sovereign Brands, owner of a rapidly growing portfolio of super-premium wine and spirits brands. The/uni00A0latter comprises mainly the brands Luc Belaire (French sparkling wines), Bumbu (a range of rum-based products from the Caribbean), the Brazilian gin McQueen and the Violet Fog,\n\nand/uni00A0the French liqueur Villon. This equity investment is the first step in a long-term partnership aimed at generating commercial opportunities between Sovereign Brands and Pernod Ricard, such as the study of possible joint industrial and commercial projects.\n\n## Definitions and/uni00A0reconciliation of/uni00A0non-IFRS measures to/uni00A0IFRS 5.6 measures\n\nPernod Ricard's management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group's management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group's performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.\n\n## Organic growth 5.6.1\n\nOrganic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchangerate movements and acquisitions and disposals.\n\nExchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year's exchange rates.\n\nForacquisitions in the current year, the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year, post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year.\n\nWhere a business, brand, brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of or terminated in the prior year,the Group excludes in the organicmovement calculations the results for that business from the prior year. For disposals or terminations in the current year, the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.\n\nThis measure enables the Group to focus on the performance of the business which is common to both years and which represents those measures that Local Managers are most directly able to influence.\n\n## Free Cash Flow 5.6.2\n\nFree Cash Flow comprises the net cash flow from operating activities, aggregated with the proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and after deduction of the capital expenditures.\n\n## 'Recurring' indicators 5.6.3\n\nThe following three measures represent key indicators for the measurement of the recurring performance of the business, excluding significant items that, because of their nature and their unusual occurrence, cannot be considered as inherent to the recurring performance of the Group:\n\n## Recurring Free Cash Flow glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n- Recurring Free Cash Flow is calculated by restating Free glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Cash Flow from non-recurring items.\n\n## Profit from recurring operations glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n- Profit from recurring operations corresponds to the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> operating profit excluding other non-current operating income and expenses.\n\n## Groupshare of net profit from recurring operations glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n- Group net profit from recurring operations corresponds to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent before other non-recurring operating income and expenses, non-recurring financial income and expenses and non-recurring income taxes.\n\n## Net debt 5.6.4\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross financial debt (translated at the closing rate), including lease liabilities and derivatives designated as fair value hedges and net foreign currency asset hedges (hedging of net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## EBITDA 5.6.5\n\nEBITDA stands for 'earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation'. EBITDA is an accounting measure calculated using the Group's profit from recurring operations excluding depreciation and amortisation on operating fixed assets.",

        "page_content": "## Material contracts 5.7\n\n## Significant contracts not related 5.7.1 to/uni00A0financing\n\n## Suntory 5.7.1.1\n\nIn 1988, Allied Domecq entered into a series of agreements with Suntory/uni00A0Ltd, one of Japan's leading producers and distributors of spirits. One of the provisions of these agreements concerned the creation of a joint-venture company in Japan called Suntory Allied/uni00A0Ltd, in which 49.99% of the capital and voting rights are owned by Allied Domecq and 50.01% by Suntory/uni00A0Ltd. Suntory Allied/uni00A0Ltd was granted the exclusive distribution rights for certain Allied Domecq brands in Japan until 31/uni00A0March 2029.\n\nThe management of Suntory Allied/uni00A0Ltd is jointly controlled by Pernod Ricard, as successor-in-interest to Allied Domecq, and/uni00A0Suntory/uni00A0Ltd.\n\n## Financing contracts 5.7.2\n\n## Credit Agreements 5.7.2.1\n\n## 2017 Credit Agreement (syndicated credit)\n\nAs part of the refinancing of the bank debt taken out in 2012 to cover the Group's short-term financing requirements, Pernod Ricard and certain of its affiliates signed a new five-year \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion revolving credit facility (the ' Credit Agreement ') on/uni00A014/uni00A0June 2017. Asthe extension options to six or seven years have been activated, this agreement now expires in 2024.\n\nThe obligations of each of the borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard. No security interest ( s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ) was granted under the terms of the Credit Agreement.\n\n## 2020Credit Agreement (bilateral credit)\n\nOn 23/uni00A0March 2020, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard Finance signed a bilateral revolving credit facility (as amended by an amendment dated 9/uni00A0April 2020, the ' Bilateral Credit Agreement ', together with the Credit Agreement, the ' Credit Agreements ') in a principal amount of \u20ac600/uni00A0million, for an initial period of 12/uni00A0months, with the option for a 12-month extension to be activated during the financial year.\n\nThe obligations of Pernod Ricard Finance under the Bilateral Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Pernod Ricard. No security interest ( s\u00fbret\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ) was granted under the terms of the Bilateral Credit Agreement.\n\n## Provisions of the Credit Agreements\n\nThe Credit Agreements contain customary representations and warranties, as well as the usual restrictive covenants contained in such contracts, notably restricting the ability of some Group companies (subject to certain exceptions) to pledge their assets as security interest, alter the general nature of the Group's activities or carry out certain acquisition transactions.\n\nThe Credit Agreements also set out obligations, including a/uni00A0commitment to provide lenders with adequate information, compliance with a solvency ratio at each half-year end as mentioned hereunder (the ' Solvency Ratio '), and compliance with certain commitments customary in this type of credit agreement (including the maintenance of the credit's pari passu ranking).\n\n## Solvency ratio (total consolidated Net 5.7.2.2 debt/consolidated EBITDA)\n\nThe Solvency Ratio must be 5.25 or less. At 30/uni00A0June 2021, the Group was compliant with this solvency ratio (see 'Liquidity risks'in this management report).\n\nThe Credit Agreements incorporate the main terms of the 2012 syndicated Credit Agreement and, in addition, provide for certain cases of voluntary or compulsory early repayment obligations, depending on circumstances, which are standard practice for credit agreements of this kind (including non-compliance with commitments, changeof control and cross default). The Credit Agreements also contain a clause under which the taking of control of Pernod Ricard by any other person or group of persons acting in concert (other than Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard or any group of persons acting in concert with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Ricard) is likely to constitute grounds for compulsory early repayment.\n\n## Bondissuance 5.7.2.3\n\nThe Group has issued Bonds (the 'Bonds') through (i)/uni00A0Pernod Ricard, and (ii)/uni00A0Pernod Ricard Finance/uni00A0LLC, a wholly-owned affiliate of Pernod Ricard, whose issues are secured by Pernod Ricard.\n\nThe nominal amount of the Bonds and the interest thereon constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the issuer in question, ranking equally amongst themselves and pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated debt, present and future, of said issuer. In addition, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard Finance/uni00A0LLC have undertaken not to grant any security interests in respect ofBonds or other debt securities admitted, or liable to be admitted, to trading on a regulated market, an over-the-counter market or other stock exchange unless the Bonds benefit from similar collateral or other collateral approved, as the case may be, by the mass of bondholders (Pernod Ricard) or by the meeting of bondholders (Pernod Ricard Finance/uni00A0LLC).\n\nThese bond issuances include a clause regarding change of control, which could lead to the compulsory early repayment of Bonds upon request of each bondholder in the event of a change of control of Pernod Ricard (benefitting a person or a group of persons acting in concert) and leading to a deterioration in Pernod Ricard's financial rating.\n\nIn addition, these Bonds may be redeemed early if certain customary eventsof default arise.",

According to the terms of the Programme, Pernod Ricard and Pernod Ricard International Finance/uni00A0LLC may issue Bonds by means of private placements in various currencies. The issues of Pernod Ricard International Finance/uni00A0LLC under the programme will be secured by Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA. The securities may be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. The maximum nominal amount of securities outstanding under the Programme is set at \u20ac7/uni00A0billion (or its equivalent in anyother currency). At its meeting on 1/uni00A0September 2020, the Board of Directors authorised Pernod Ricard to issue Bonds under the Programme up to a maximum nominal amount of \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion (or its equivalent in any other currency) for a period of one year from 1/uni00A0September 2020.\n\n## Europe Factoring Agreement 5.7.2.5\n\nOn 15/uni00A0December 2008, certain affiliates of Pernod Ricard and/uni00A0Pernod Ricard Finance signed a factoring framework agreement with BNP Paribas Factor, to set up a pan-European factoring programme in the gross amount of \u20ac350/uni00A0million, which/uni00A0was/uni00A0increased to \u20ac400/uni00A0million by an addendum dated 23/uni00A0June/uni00A02009. The programme was most recently renewed on 3/uni00A0December/uni00A02018, for a period of five years from 1/uni00A0January 2019. This/uni00A0programme was agreed in the amount of \u20ac500/uni00A0million. The/uni00A0receivables are sold under the contractual subrogation regime under French law, except where certain local legal restrictions are in force. As substantially all of the risks and rewards related to the receivables are transferred to the purchaser in accordance with this factoring programme, transferred receivables are deconsolidated.\n\n## Securitisation (Master Receivables 5.7.2.6 Assignment Agreement)\n\nOn24/uni00A0June 2009, certainaffiliates of Pernod Ricard entered into an international securitisation programme arranged by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The purpose of the programme was the transfer of eligible commercial receivables to \u20acSTR, in accordance with the provisions of a framework agreement dated 24/uni00A0June 2009 and country-specific agreements entered into at the time that each relevant affiliate joined the programme. This programme was renewed on 17/uni00A0June 2019 under the terms of an addendum to the framework agreement. The programme amounts to \u20ac65/uni00A0million, US$230/uni00A0million, \u00a3145/uni00A0million and 400/uni00A0million Swedish kronor.\n\nThis three-year programme includes a change of control clause that applies to eachaffiliate participating in the programme as a seller, which could lead to the early repayment of the programme by the affiliate concerned by such change of control. 'Change of control'is defined as Pernod Ricard ceasing to hold, directly or indirectly,at least 80% of the share capital or voting rights of an affiliate participating in the programme as a seller, unless (i)/uni00A0Pernod Ricard continues to hold, directlyor indirectly, 50% of the share capital or voting rights of suchaffiliate and (ii)/uni00A0issues, at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, a guarantee in/uni00A0terms that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB deems satisfactory (acting/uni00A0reasonably) for the purpose of securing the obligations of/uni00A0such affiliate under the securitisation transaction documents.\n\n## Factoring agreement Pacific 5.7.2.7\n\nOn 18/uni00A0March 2013, a new agreement for the saleofreceivables was signed between Pernod Ricard Winemakers Pty/uni00A0Ltd (formerly Premium Wine Brands Pty/uni00A0 (1) ), Pernod Ricard Winemakers New Zealand Limited (formerly Pernod Ricard New Zealand Limited) and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc. This factoring agreement covers Australia and New Zealand and/uni00A0amounts to AUD128.5/uni00A0million and NZD45/uni00A0million. The/uni00A0receivables sale agreement was taken over in full by BNP Paribas on 4/uni00A0December 2015, replacing The Royal Bank of/uni00A0Scotland plc.\n\nAdditional information on the impact of these financing contracts on the Group's financial statements is provided in Notes/uni00A04.8.1 -Breakdown of net financial debt by nature and maturity and 4.8.7 Bonds to the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies and/uni00A0significant events Note/uni00A01\n\n## Accounting policies Note/uni00A01.1\n\n## Principles and accounting standards 1. governing the preparation of the annual consolidated financial statements\n\nBecause of its listing in a country of the European Union, and in accordance with EC Regulation 1606/02, the Group's consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 30/uni00A0June 2021 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe accounting policies used to prepare the consolidated financial statements to 30/uni00A0June 2021 are consistent with those used for the consolidated financial statements to 30/uni00A0June 2020, with the exception of standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union applicable to the Group from 1/uni00A0July 2020 (see Note/uni00A01.1.2 -Changes in accounting standards ). The Group does not adopt early application of standards or interpretations.\n\nThe Group's financial year runs from 1/uni00A0July to 30/uni00A0June.\n\n## Changes in accounting standards 2.\n\n## Standards, amendments and interpretations whose/uni00A0implementation has been mandatory since/uni00A01/uni00A0July/uni00A02020\n\nAs of 1/uni00A0July 2020, the Group has applied the amendment to IFRS/uni00A09 and IFRS/uni00A07 published by the IASB in September/uni00A02019 and adopted by the European Union as part of the reform of benchmark interest rates. This amendment allows the Group not to take into account uncertainties about the future of benchmark interest rates in assessing the effectiveness of hedging relationships and/or in evaluating the highly probable nature of the hedged risk, thereby enabling it to secure existing or future hedging relationships until such uncertainties are resolved.\n\nDocumented interest rate derivatives hedging debts indexed to a benchmark rate are presented in Note/uni00A04.8 -/uni00A0 Financial liabilities . At 30/uni00A0June 2021, the Group's exposure to financial instruments indexed to floating rates with a maturity date beyond the implementation date of the reform is limited. The potential impact on financial information of the replacement of an existing benchmark rate by another will take effect as soon as Phase/uni00A02 of the benchmark interest rate reform is adopted.\n\nThe effects of the following IFRS/uni00A0IC agenda decisions are currently being analysed by the Group:\n\n- decision published in April/uni00A02021 relating to IAS/uni00A038 (Intangible glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Assets) on the recognition of configuration or customisation costs in a cloud computing arrangement as part of a 'Software as a service' agreement;\n- decision published in April/uni00A02021 relating to IAS/uni00A019 (Employee glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Benefits) on the attribution of employee benefits to periods of service. This decision clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed in allocating the IAS/uni00A019 expense.\n\nWhere applicable, the impact of the application of these decisions will be presented subsequently.\n\nFurthermore, the following decisions did not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements at 30/uni00A0June 2021:\n\n- decision published in June/uni00A02021 on IAS/uni00A02 (Inventories/uni00A0- Costs) glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> necessary to sell inventories;\n- decisionpublished in June/uni00A02021 on IAS/uni00A010 (Events after the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> reporting period/uni00A0- Preparation of financial statements) when an entity is no longer a going concern.\n\nNo other new standards, amendments or interpretations are applicable to Pernod Ricard as of 1/uni00A0July 2020.\n\n## Measurement basis 3.\n\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost method, except for certain categories of assetsand liabilities, which are measured in accordance with the methods provided by IFRS.\n\n## Principal uncertainties arising from 4. the/uni00A0use/uni00A0of estimates and judgements by/uni00A0Management\n\n## Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS means that Group Management makes a certain number of estimates and assumptions which have an impact on the amount of the Group's assetsand liabilities, and items of profit and loss during the financial year.These estimates are made on the assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern, and are based on informationavailable at the time of their preparation. Estimates may be revised where the circumstances on which they were based change or where new information becomes available. Future outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\n## Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A04.1 -Intangible assets and goodwill , l in addition to annual impairment tests applied to goodwill and intangibleassets with indefinite useful lives (such as brands), the Group carries out spot impairment tests where there is an indication that the value of an intangible asset may have been impaired. Any impairment loss is calculated using discounted future cash flows and/or the market values of the assets in question. These calculations require the use of assumptions regarding market conditions and projected cash flows, and any changes in these assumptions may thus lead to results different from those initially estimated.\n\n## Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions , the Group runs defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. In addition, provisions are also recognised in virtue of certain other post-employment benefits such as life insurance and medical care (mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom).The carrying amount of these provisions at the balance sheet date is set out in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions.\n\nThese benefit obligations are based on a number of assumptions such as discount rates, future salary increases, the rate of employee turnoverand life expectancy.\n\nThese assumptions are generally updated annually. The assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for the year ended 30/uni00A0June 2021and the procedures used in their determination are set out in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions . The Group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified. However, such actuarial assumptions may change in the future and this may have a material impact on the amount of the Group's benefit obligations and on its profits.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred tax\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A03.3 Corporate income tax , x the deferred tax assets recognised result mainly from tax loss carryforwards and from temporary differences between the tax base and the carrying amounts of assetsand liabilities. Deferred tax assetsin respect of tax losses are recognised if it is probable that the Group will have future taxable profits against which suchlosses will be used. The assessment of whether the Group will beableto use these tax losses is largely a matter of judgement.f Analyses are carried out to decidewhether or not these tax loss carryforwards are likely to be usable in the future.\n\n## Provisions\n\nAs explained in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions , the Group is involved in a number of disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. In some cases, the amounts requested by the claimants are significant and the legal proceedings can take several years. In this context, provisions are calculated on the basis of the Group's best estimate of the amount that will be payable based on the information available (notably that provided by the Group's legal advisers). Any change to assumptions can haveasignificant effect on the amount of the provision recognised. The carrying amount of these provisions at the balance sheet date isset out in Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions .\n\n## Judgements\n\nIn the absence of standards or interpretations applicable to a specific transaction, Group Management uses its judgement to define and apply accounting policies that provide relevant and reliable information in the context of the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A029, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy since 1/uni00A0July 2018.\n\nHowever, given the contribution of Argentina's business performance to the Group's financial statements, the impact of the application of IAS/uni00A029 has been deemed non-material, and the corresponding restatements have not been made.\n\n## Business combinations 5.\n\nBusiness combinations carried out before 1/uni00A0July 2009 were recognised using the accounting standards in force as of 30/uni00A0June 2009. Business combinations after 1/uni00A0July 2009 are measured and recognised in accordance with the revised version of IFRS/uni00A03: the consideration transferred (cost of acquisition) is measured at the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the transaction date.Identifiable assets and liabilities belonging to the acquired company are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition, such as legal, due diligence and other professional fees are recognised as other operating expenses incurred.\n\nAny surplus consideration in excess of the Group's share in the fair value of the acquired company's identifiable assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill. The option is available for each transaction to apply either proportionate or full goodwill methods. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of foreign entities is denominated in the functional currency of the business acquired. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, it is subject to an impairment test once a year or more often if there is any indication that its value may have beenimpaired.\n\nFinally, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A03 as revised and IAS/uni00A027 as amended, the Group recognised in shareholders' equity the difference between the price paid and the proportional part of non-controlling interests acquired in previously controlled companies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation 6.\n\n## Reporting currency used in the consolidated 6.1 financial statements\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared in euros, which is the functional currency and the reporting currency of the Parent Company.\n\n## Functional currency 6.2\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the economic environment in which it mainly operates. In most cases, the functional currency is the entity's local currency. However, in a very limited number of entities, a functional currency that is different from the local currency may be used if it reflects the entity's economic environment and the currency in which most of the entity's transactions are denominated.\n\n## Translation of transactions denominated 6.3 in/uni00A0foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are generally translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate applicable at the transaction date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised at the historical exchange rate applicableat the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate applying at the closing date. Foreign currency differences are recognised in profit and loss for the period, except for foreign currency differences arising on debts designated as hedges for the net foreign currency assets of consolidated affiliates. The latter are recognised directly in shareholders' equity, under currency translation adjustments, until the disposal of the net investment. Foreign currency differences related to operating activities are recognised within operating profit for the period; foreign currency differences related to financing activities are recognised within financial income (expense) or in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Translation of financial statements of affiliates 6.4 whose functional currency is different from the/uni00A0euro (the reporting currency)\n\nThe balance sheet is translated into euros at year-end exchange rates. The income statement and cashflows are translated on the basis of average exchange rates. The differences resulting from the translation of the financial statements of these affiliates are recognised in translation differences within shareholders' equity under other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, currency translation adjustments previously recognised in shareholders' equity are recognised in profit and loss.",

They are shown separately in the balance sheet at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell. An asset is considered as being held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. In orderfor this to be the\n\ncase, the asset must be available for immediate sale and its sale must be highly probable. Items in the balance sheet related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented under specific lines in the consolidated financial statements. Income statement items related to discontinued operations and assets held for sale are presented separately in the financial statements for all periods reported upon if they are significant from a Group perspective.\n\n## Significant events during the financial year Note/uni00A01.2\n\n## Impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic 1.\n\nThe continuation of the Covid-19 pandemic over most of FY21 has impacted the Group's business. Many countries have taken strict measures to try to slow the spread of the epidemic and have imposed the closure of establishments open to the public (including bars, hotels and restaurants) as well as lockdown measures and restrictions on international travel (affecting Travel Retail activities in particular).\n\nNevertheless, the Group rebounded and net sales amounted to \u20ac8,824/uni00A0million (an increase of 9.7% in organic growth and 4.5% in reported growth).\n\nAs part of the management of this crisis, the Group has taken a number of strong measures:\n\n- priority given to the health and safety of its employees and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> partners;\n- active inventory management to maintain a healthy level in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> main markets;\n- active management of resources and cost control to adapt to glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the crisis;\n- dynamic cash management and a strengthened liquidity glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> position thanks to a new bond issue in US dollars over the period and the early redemption of Bonds maturing in April/uni00A02021 and January/uni00A02022 (see Note - 1.2.2.2 Bond issues and redemptions ).\n\nDespite the crisis, the Group has continued to implement its Transform & Accelerate agenda.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has paid particular attention to the recoverability of its trade receivables in view of the increased credit risk related to the crisis, with the measures implemented enabling optimised management of trade receivables.\n\n## Other significant events during the financial 2. year\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals 2.1\n\nDuring the year, the Group continued the same strategy by strengthening its positions through partnerships/acquisitions of super and ultra-Premium brands in fast-growing categories such as the agreements signed with the companies Ojo de Tigre, owner of the Mezcal brand of the same name, Vermuteria de Galicia, owner of the Spanish Vermouth Petroni and La Hechicera Company, owner of the Columbian rum of the same name.\n\n## Bondissues and redemptions 2.2\n\nOn 1/uni00A0October 2020,the Group Pernod Ricard, through one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, issued a US$2/uni00A0billion bond in three tranches of 7.5, 10.5 and 30/uni00A0years, bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 1.25%, 1.625% and 2.75%, respectively.\n\nOn 6/uni00A0November 2020, Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA redeemed (i)/uni00A0the remaining amount of the 5.75%Bonds maturing in April/uni00A02021 for a principal amount of US$500/uni00A0million, and (ii)/uni00A0all of the 4.45% Bonds maturing in January/uni00A02022 for a principal amount of US$1,500/uni00A0million in accordance with the optional redemption clause provided for in the terms and conditions of these Bonds.\n\nThese early redemptions gave rise to the payment of a non-recurring fee (called 'make-wholecall') of \u20ac72/uni00A0million.\n\nOn 26/uni00A0January 2021, Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA redeemed the total of its Pandios USD bond for an amount of US$ 201/uni00A0million.\n\n## Favourable court ruling on Drawback 2.3. in/uni00A0the/uni00A0United States\n\nAlawsuit was filed on April 15, 2019 by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) against the US Treasury Department and the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on behalf of its members, including Pernod Ricard, to invalidate the regulations published in February 2019 and to affirm that Drawback is authorised pursuant to Article19 USC\u00a7 1313(j)(2) as amended by the Trade Facilitation and TradeEnforcement Act of 2015, which was enacted on February 24, 2016 (TFTEA).\n\nThe Drawback provided for under US law allows a company to benefit from the refund of excise duties or taxes paid on certain imported goods when similar goods are exported. On August/uni00A023,/uni00A02021, the US Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit handed downits ruling in favour of the National Association of Manufacturers, upholding the first instance judgement handed down in February 2020. As a result, Pernod Ricard may benefit from the Drawback on the basis of exports of certainspirits outside the United States. The impact of this decision on Pernod Ricard's FY21 financial statements represents an additional pre-tax income of US$163 million (\u20ac137 million), of which US$33/uni00A0million (\u20ac28 million euros) in Profit from Recurring Operations. As of June 30, 2021, the Group had already collected US$187 million (\u20ac156 million) in respect of claims already filed.\n\nAs part of its strategy of dynamic management of its brand portfolio, the Group also sold the Doble/uni00A0V brand in Spain.",

It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or to be received, after deducting trade discounts, volume rebates, certain costs associated with business and promotional activity and sales-related taxes and duties, notably excise duties.\n\n## Costs of commercial and promotional activity\n\nPursuant to IFRS/uni00A015, certain costs of services rendered in connection with sales, such as advertising programmes in conjunction with distributors, listing costs for new products, promotional activities at point of sale, and advertising and promotional expenses, are deducted directly from net sales if there is no distinct service whose fair value can be reliably measured.\n\n## Duties and taxes\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A015, certain import duties, in Asia for instance, are classified as cost of sales, as these duties are not specifically re-billed to customers (as is the case for social security stampsin France, for example).\n\n## Discounts\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A015, early payment discounts are not considered to be financial transactions, but rather are deducted directly from net sales.\n\nThe Group is focused on the single business line of Wines and Spirits sales. The Group is structured into three primary operating segments constituted by the following geographical areas: Europe, Americas and Asia/Rest of World.\n\nThe Group Management Team assesses the performance of each segment on the basis of sales and its profit from recurring operations, defined as the gross margin after logistics, advertising, promotional and structure costs. The operating segments presented are identical to those included in the reporting provided to Managing Directors, in particular for the performance analysis.\n\n## Gross margin after logistics expenses, contribution after advertising and promotion expenses, profit from recurring operations and other operating income and expenses\n\nThe gross margin after logistics costs corresponds to sales (excluding duties and taxes), less costsof sales and logistics expenses.The contributionafteradvertising and promotion expenses includes the gross margin after deduction of logistics expenses and advertising and promotion expenses. The Group applies recommendation 2013-R03 of the French accounting standards authority (Autorit\u00e9 des Normes Comptables - ANC), notably as regards the definition of Profit from recurring operations. Profit from recurring operations is the contribution after advertising and promotion expenses less trading costs and overheads. This isthe indicator used internally to measure the Group's operational performance. It excludes other operating income and expenses, such as those related to restructuring,capital gains and losses on disposals, impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and other non-recurring operating income or expenses. These other operating income and expenses are excluded from Profit from recurring operations because the Group believes they have little predictive value due totheir occasional nature. They are described in detail in Note/uni00A03.1 Other operating income and expenses .\n\nItems in the income statement and the balance sheet are allocated on the basis of either the destination of sales or profits. Operating segments follow the same accounting policies as those used for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Intra-segment transfers are transacted at market prices.\n\n| At 30.06.2020 \u20ac million                      | Americas   | Asia/Rest of/uni00A0World   | Europe   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Income statement items                       |            |                             |          |         |\n| Segment net sales                            | 3,747      | 5,181                       | 4,032    | 12,960  |\n| o/w intersegment sales                       | 1,298      | 1,715                       | 1,500    | 4,512   |\n| Net sales (excluding Group)                  | 2,449      | 3,467                       | 2,532    | 8,448   |\n| Gross margin after logistics expenses        | 1,599      | 1,969                       | 1,519    | 5,086   |\n| Contribution after advertising and promotion | 1,138      | 1,452                       | 1,169    | 3,759   |\n| Profit from recurring operations             | 718        | 938                         | 605      | 2,260   |\n| Other information                            |            |                             |          |         |\n| Current investments                          | 113        | 233                         | 611      | 957     |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment    | 972        | 133                         | 251      | 1,356   |",

Deferred tax assets are recognised in the balance sheet when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered in future years.

In order to evaluate the Group's ability to recover these assets, particular account is taken of forecasts of future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards are only reported when they are likely to be recovered, based on projections of taxable income calculated by the Group at the end of each financial year. All assumptions used, including, in/uni00A0particular, growth in operating profit and financial income (expenses), taking into account interest rates, are reviewed by the Group at the end of the financial year based on data determined by the relevant senior management.",

Whenfunds are obtained at the date of exercise of the dilutive instruments, the 'treasury stock' method is used to determine the theoretical number ofshares to be taken into account. When funds are obtained at the issue date of the dilutive instruments, net profit is adjusted for the finance cost, net of tax, relating to these instruments.\n\n| Numerator (\u20ac million)                                     | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Group net profit                                          | 329          | 1,305        |\n| Denominator (in number of shares)                         |              |              |\n| Average number of outstanding shares                      | 262,858,086  | 260,796,076  |\n| Dilutive effect of bonus share allocations                | 1,063,687    | 624,364      |\n| Dilutive effect of stock options and subscription options | 115,058      | 93,465       |\n| Average number of outstanding shares - diluted            | 264,036,831  | 261,513,904  |\n| Earnings per share (\u20ac)                                    |              |              |\n| Earnings per share - basic                                | 1.25         | 5.00         |\n| Earnings per share - diluted                              | 1.24         | 4.99         |\n\n## Expenses by type Note/uni00A03.5\n\nOperating profit notably includes depreciation, amortisationand impairment expenses as well as personnel expenses as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                                                                 | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment expense on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets* | (1,314)      | (441)        |\n| Salaries and payroll costs                                                                                | (1,317)      | (1,216)      |\n| Pensions, medical expenses and other similar benefits under defined-benefit plans                         | (46)         | (46)         |\n| Expense related to share-based payments                                                                   | (22)         | (28)         |\n| TOTAL PERSONNEL EXPENSES                                                                                  | (1,385)      | (1,290)      |\n\nOperating profit also includes \u20ac4.3/uni00A0millionin lease expenses relating to short-term leases, \u20ac1.7/uni00A0million in expenses relating to leases of low-value assets and \u20ac2.1/uni00A0millionin expenses relating to variable rents.",

These asset groupings correspond\n\nto groups of assets which jointly generate identifiable cash flows that are largely independent. If impairment is identified, an impairment loss is recognised in profit and loss for the financial year.\n\nGoodwill mainly stems from the acquisitions of Allied Domecq in July/uni00A02005 and Vin&Sprit in July/uni00A02008. The change in the value of goodwill in the period was mainly due to the acquisitions mentioned in Note/uni00A01.2.1 Significant events during the financial year Acquisitions and disposals , as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n## Brands\n\nThefair value of identifiable acquired brandsis determined using an actuarial calculation of estimated future profits or using theroyalty method and corresponds to thefair value of the brands at the date of acquisition. As the Group's brands are intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, they are not\n\namortised but are rather subject to an impairment test at least once a year or whenever there is an indication that their value may have been impaired. Brands acquired as a part of acquisitions of foreign entities are denominated in the functional currency ofthe business acquired.\n\nThe main brands recorded on the balance sheet are:Absolut, Ballantine's, Beefeater, Chivas Regal,Kahl\u00faa, Malibu, Martell and Brancott Estate. Most of these were recognised at the time of the acquisitions of Seagram, Allied Domecq and Vin&Sprit. The change in the gross value of brands for the period was mainly due to the acquisitions mentioned in Note/uni00A01.2.1 Significant events during the financial year Acquisitions and disposals , as well as currency fluctuations.\n\n## Impairment of tangible or intangible assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A036, intangible assetsand property,plant and equipment are subject to impairment tests whenever there is an indication that the value of the asset has been impaired and at least once a year for non-current assets with indefinite useful lives (goodwill and brands).\n\nThe assetssubject to impairment tests are included in cash generating units (CGUs), corresponding to linked groups of assets which generate identifiable cash flows. The CGUs include assets related to the Group's brands and are allocated in accordance with the three geographical areas defined by the Group, on the basis of thesale destination of the products. Concerning the inclusion of leases treated in accordance with IFRS/uni00A016, the simplified method was used, consisting of including the net value of the rights-of-use and lease liabilities in the various CGUs.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised within operating profit. The recoverable amount of the CGUis the higher of its market value and its value in use.\n\nValue in use is measured based on cash flows projected over a 19-year period. This period reflects the typically long lives of the Group's brands and their productive assets. Discounted projected cash flows are established based on annual budgets and multi-year strategies, extrapolated into subsequent years by gradually converging the figure for the last year of theplan\n\nfor each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal value derived by capitalising the cash flows generated in the last forecast year. Assumptions applied tosales and advertising and promotional expenditure are determined by Management based on previous results and long-term development trends in the markets concerned. The cash flow projection methodology takes into account, with respect to Working Capital Requirements and investments, the specific features of white spirits and maturing alcohols. The present values of discounted cash flows are sensitive to these assumptions, as well as to consumer trendsand economic factors.\n\nMarket value is based either on thesale price, net of selling costs, obtained undernormal market conditions or earnings multiples observed in recent transactions concerning comparable assets. The discount rate used for these calculations is an after-tax rate applied to after-tax cash flows and correspondsto the weighted average cost of capital.This rate reflects specific rates for each market or region, depending on the risksthat they represent. Assumptions made in terms of future changes in net sales and in terms of terminal values are reasonableand consistent with market data availablefor each of the CGUs. Additional impairment tests are applied where events or specific circumstances suggest that a potential impairment exists.",

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Useful life is reviewed on a regular basis.The averagedepreciable lives for the major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Buildings               | 15 to 50/uni00A0years   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Machinery and equipment | 5 to 15/uni00A0years    |\n| Other fixed assets      | 3 to 5/uni00A0years     |\n| Vines                   | 25 to 33/uni00A0years   |\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.\n\nIn accordance with the amendments to standards IAS/uni00A041 and IAS/uni00A016, vines are,since 1/uni00A0July 2016, valued at acquisition cost and depreciated over their useful life. In accordance with IAS/uni00A041, agricultural produce (harvests) continues to be recognised at fair value on the balance sheet, after deducting estimated\n\nselling costs, as from the date at which it is possible to obtain a reliable assessment of price, for example by referring to an active market.Changes in fair value are recognised in profit and loss. Land on which biological assets are planted is measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A016.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A016, applicable from 1/uni00A0July 2019, right-of-use assets for leases are recognised as property, plant and equipment in the class of underlying asset to which the rightof use relates, with the corresponding recognition of a lease liability. These are mainly offices occupied by the Group and recorded under Buildings. The value of right-of-use assets is determined on the basis of the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for the amount of prepaid rent, initial direct costs, benefits received from lessors and, where applicable, remediation costs. Right-of-use assets relating to leases are depreciated over the term of the lease. The accounting principles for determining the lease liability are detailed in Note/uni00A04.8 Financial liabilities .\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment, including right-of-use assets, are written down when their recoverable amount falls below their net carrying amount.",

Fair value results and the disposal gain or loss are recorded, in accordance with the management intention, either (i)/uni00A0in the income statement under the heading 'Financial income/Financial expenses - other non-recurring financial items' or (ii)/uni00A0in consolidated shareholders' equity under the heading 'Other comprehensive income' and are not recycled through profit or loss.\n\nFair value is determined on the basis of the financial criteria most appropriate to the specific situation of each company.The fair value of financial assets listed on a financial market is their stock market value. The valuation criteria generally used for other non-consolidated investments are share of equity and future profitability.\n\n## Loans, guarantees and deposits\n\nLoans, guarantees and deposits are valued at amortised cost.\n\n|                                        | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million                              | Current      | Non-current  | Current      | Non-current  |\n| Net financial assets                   |              |              |              |              |\n| Equity instruments                     | -            | 93           | -            | 286          |\n| Other financial assets                 | -            | 273          | -            | 294          |\n| Net loans and receivables              |              |              |              |              |\n| Loans, receivables and deposits*       | -            | 156          | -            | 106          |\n| Total net non-current financial assets | -            | 522          | -            | 685          |\n| Derivative instruments                 | 12           | 54           | 8            | 65           |\n| FINANCIAL ASSETS                       | 12           | 576          | 8            | 750          |\n\nThe table below shows the movements of financial assets, excluding derivative instruments:\n\n|                                                                     | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year             | Movements in the year   | Movements in the year   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                           | 30.06.2019              | Acquisitions            | Allowances              | Disposals               | Foreign currency gains and losses | Other movements         | 30.06.2020              |\n| Other financial assets                                              | 1,097                   | 2                       | -                       | (6)                     | 13                                | (832)                   | 273                     |\n| Equity instruments                                                  | 202                     | 19                      | -                       | (2)                     | 0                                 | (119)                   | 101                     |\n| Investment-related receivables                                      | 191                     | 31                      | -                       | (9)                     | (9)                               | 16                      | 219                     |\n| GROSS VALUE                                                         | 1,489                   | 52                      | -                       | (17)                    | 4                                 | (935)                   | 593                     |\n| Provisions for other financial assets                               | 0                       | -                       | 0                       | -                       | 0                                 | 0                       | 0                       |\n| Impairment losses recognised on available-for-sale financial assets | -                       | -                       | -                       | -                       | -                                 | -                       | -                       |\n| Provisions on equity instruments                                    | (7)                     | -                       | -                       | -                       | 0                                 | -                       | (7)                     |\n| Impairment losses recognised on investment-related receivables      | (62)                    | -                       | -                       | -                       | (1)                               | 0                       | (63)                    |\n| PROVISIONS                                                          | (70)                    | -                       | 0                       | -                       | (1)                               | 0                       | (71)                    |\n| NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS, NET                                   | 1,419                   | 52                      | 0                       | (17)                    | 3                                 | (935)                   | 522                     |",

Net realisable value is the selling price less the estimated costs of completion and sale of inventories. Most inventories are valued using the weighted average cost method.The cost of long-cycle\n\ninventories is computed using a singlemethod which includes distilling and ageing costs. These inventories are classified in current assets, although a substantial part remains in inventory for more than one year in order to undergo the ageing process used for certain wines & spirits before being sold.",

More specifically, non-impaired receivables with due dates of over 12/uni00A0months show no additional credit-related risk. There is no significant concentration of risks.\n\nThe change in impairment of trade and other operating receivables during FY20 and FY21 is notably linked to a reassessment of the recoverability of receivables in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn FY20 and FY21, the Group continued to implement its programmes to sell the receivables of several affiliates. Receivables sold under these programmes totalled \u20ac513/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2020 and \u20ac592/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2021.

In the case where a potential obligation resulting from past events exists, but where the occurrence of the outflow of resources is not probable or where the amount cannot be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed among the Group's commitments.The amounts provided for are measured by taking account of the most probable assumptions or using statistical methods, depending on the nature of the obligations. Provisions notably include:\n\n- provisions for restructuring; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- provisions for pensions and other long-term employee glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> benefits;\n- provisions for litigation (tax other than corporate income tax, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> legal, employee-related).\n\nLitigation is kept under regular review, on a case-by-case basis, by the Legal Department of each affiliate or region or by the Group'sLegal Department, drawing on the help of external legal consultants in the most significant or complex cases. A provision is recorded when it becomes probable that a present obligation arising from a past event will require an outflow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated. The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to settle this obligation.\n\n## Breakdown of provisions 1.\n\nThe breakdown of provisions for risks and charges at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                     | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-current provisions                                        |              |              |\n| Provisions for pensions and other long-term employee benefits | 605          | 477          |\n| Other non-current provisions for risks and charges            | 310          | 253          |\n| Current provisions                                            |              |              |\n| Provisions for restructuring                                  | 101          | 50           |\n| Other current provisions for risks and charges                | 121          | 113          |\n| TOTAL                                                         | 1,138        | 893          |\n\nThe cost of restructuring measures is fully provisioned in the financial year, and is recognised in profit and loss under'Other operating income and expenses' when it is material and results from a Group obligation to third parties arising from a decision made by the competent corporate body that has been announced to the third parties concerned before the closing date. This cost mainly involves redundancy payments, early retirement payments, costs of notice periods not served, training costs of departing individuals and costs of site closure. Scrapping of property, plant and equipment, impairment of inventories and other assets, as well as other costs (moving costs, training of transferred individuals, etc.) directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs.The amounts provided for correspond to forecast future payments to be made in connection with restructuring plans, discounted to present value when the payment schedule is such that the effect of the time value of moneyis significant.",

They are also subject to tax audits, some of which may lead to adjustment. The main disputes are described in Note/uni00A06.5 Disputes .\n\nAt 30/uni00A0June 2021, the provisions recorded by the Group forall litigation and risks in which it is involved amounted to \u20ac366/uni00A0million, excluding uncertain tax positions recognised in current tax liabilities.The Group does not provide details (with exceptions), as it believes the disclosure of the amount of any provision booked in consideration of each pending dispute would be likely to cause serious harm to the Group.\n\n## Provision for pension benefits 3.\n\nIn accordance with applicable national legislation, the Group's employee benefit obligations are composed of:\n\n- long-term post-employment benefits (retirement bonuses, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> pensions, medical and healthcare expenses, etc.);\n- long-term benefits payable during the period of employment. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nContributions are recognised as expenses as they are incurred. As the Group is not committed beyond the amount of such contributions, no provision is recognised in respect of defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the projected unit credit method is used to measure the present value of defined benefit obligations, current service cost and, if applicable, past service cost. The measurement ismadeat each closing date and the personal data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculation requires the use of economic assumptions (inflation rate and discount rate) and assumptions concerning employees (mainly averagesalary increase, rate of employee turnoverand life expectancy). The assumptions used in FY19 and FY20 and the methods used for their determination are described below.\n\nA provision is recorded in the balance sheet for the difference between the actuarial debt of related obligations (actuarial liabilities) and any assets dedicated to funding the plans, measured at their fair value, and includes past service costs and actuarial gains and losses.\n\nThe Group provides employee benefits such as pensions and retirement bonuses and other post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance:\n\n- in France, benefit obligations mainly comprise arrangements glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> for retirement indemnities (non-funded) and supplementary pension benefits (partly funded);\n\nThe change in 'Other current and non-current provisions' during the period is explained as follows:\n\n- allowances stem mainly from proceedings brought against the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Company and its affiliates, as part of the normal course of business and the emergence of new risks, including tax risks (other than corporate income tax risks);\n- reversals are made at the time of corresponding payments or glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> where the risk is considered to be nil. Unused reversals primarily concern the re-evaluation or the statute of limitation of certain risks, including tax risks.\n\nThe cost of defined benefit plans has three components, which are accounted for as follows:\n\n- the cost of services is recognised in operating profit. glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> It/uni00A0includes:\n- the cost of services rendered during the period, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- the cost of past services resulting from the modification or glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> reduction of a plan, fully recognised in profit and loss for the period in which the services were performed,\n- gains and losses resulting from liquidations; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- the financial component, recorded in financial income glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> (expenses), comprises the impact of discounting the liabilities, net of the expected return on plan assets, measured using the same discount rate as that used to measure the liabilities;\n- revaluations of liabilities (assets) are recognised as glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> non-recyclable items of comprehensive income, and consist mainly of actuarial differences, namely the change in plan obligations and assets due to changes in assumptions and to experience gains or losses, the latter representing the difference between the expected impact of some actuarial assumptions applied to previous valuations and the actual impact. Depending on the nature of the texts governing the plans in certain zones, if the hedging assets exceed the commitments entered into the accounts, any assets generated may be limited to the present value of the future reimbursements and the expected decreases in future contributions.\n- in the United States and Canada, benefit obligations include glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> funded pension plans guaranteed to employees as well as unfunded post-employment medical plans;\n- in Ireland,the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, benefit glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> obligations mainly consist of pension plans granted to employees.",

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nDefined benefit plans in the Group relate mainly to affiliates in the United Kingdom, in North Americaand in the rest of Europe. Defined benefit plans are subject to an annual actuarial valuation on the basis of assumptions depending on the country.Under these pension and other benefit plan agreements, employees receive at the date of retirement either a capital lump sum payment or an annuity. These amounts depend on the number of years of employment, final salary and the position held by the employee. At 30/uni00A0June 2021, fully or partly funded benefit obligations totalled \u20ac5,202/uni00A0million, equivalent to 95% of the total benefit obligations.\n\nCertain affiliates, mainly those located in North America, also provide their employees with post-employment medical cover. These benefit obligations are unfunded. They are measured using the same assumptions as those used for the pension obligations in the countries in question.\n\nSeveral affiliates, mainly in Europe, also provide their employees with other long-term benefits. Benefit obligations of this type are mainly in respect of long-service awardsand jubilee awards.\n\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of the provision between 30/uni00A0June 2020 and 30/uni00A0June 2021:\n\n|                                                                     | 30.06.2020          | 30.06.2020                                   | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021          | 30.06.2021                                   | 30.06.2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million                                                           | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        | Pension commitments | Medical expenses and other employee benefits | Total        |\n| Net liability/(asset) at beginning of period                        | (671)               | 147                                          | (524)        | 196                 | 145                                          | 341          |\n| Net expense/(income) for the period                                 | 26                  | 5                                            | 30           | 54                  | 4                                            | 58           |\n| Actuarial (gains)/losses/uni00A0 (1)                                | 916                 | 3                                            | 919          | (126)               | 0                                            | (126)        |\n| Employer contributions                                              | (53)                | -

The discount rates are based on the Group's borrowing rateplus a spread to take into account country-specific economic environments. They are estimated in each currencyusing available market data. They take into account the term of the leases. Lease payments may include fixed or variable payments that depend on a rate or index known at the commencement date of the lease.\n\nThe period used to calculate the lease liability corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the contract, unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will exercise a renewal option beyond this period.The probability of exercising an option is determined on a lease-by-lease basis, taking into account Management's intentions. This liability is then calculated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nLeases are recognised in the balance sheet from the commencement date. They are presented in 'Lease liabilities' with a corresponding entry in 'Property, plant and equipment', depending on the nature of the underlying asset (see Note/uni00A04.1 Property, plant and equipment ). t t Lease liabilities comprise a current and non-current portion on the basis of the expected future payments.\n\nIn the income statement, depreciation expenses are recognised on the basis of the use of the underlying asset and interest expenses are presented in financial income/(expense).\n\nIn the cash flow statement, repayments of lease liabilities are reported under 'Lease repayments' in cash flow from financing activities, while interest payments are reported under 'Interest paid' in cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe Group has chosen not to apply IFRS/uni00A016 to leases corresponding to assets with a low unit replacement value or to short-term leases. These leases are recognised directly in expenses.\n\nNet financial debt, as defined and used by the Group, corresponds to total gross financial debt (translated at the closing rate), including lease liabilities and fair value and net foreign currency asset hedged derivatives (hedging of net investments and similar), less cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Breakdown of net financial debt by nature and maturity 1.\n\n|                                                        | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2021   | 30.06.2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million                                              | Current      | Non- current | Total        | Current      | Non- current | Total        |\n| Bonds                                                  | 723          | 8,599        | 9,322        | 70           | 8,787        | 8,857        |\n| Syndicated loan                                        | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            |\n| Commercial paper                                       | 299          | -            | 299          | 7            | -            | 7            |\n| Other loans and financial debts                        | 81           | 192          | 273          | 115          | 108          | 222          |\n| Other financial liabilities                            | 380          | 192          | 572          | 122          | 108          | 229          |\n| GROSS FINANCIAL DEBT                                   | 1,103        | 8,791        | 9,894        | 192          | 8,894        | 9,086        |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives instruments - assets      | (3)          | (40)         | (44)         | -            | (22)         | (22)         |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives instruments - liabilities | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives                           | (3)          | (40)         | (44)         | -            | (22)         | (22)         |\n| Net investment hedge derivatives - assets              | -            | (13)         | (13)         | -            | (43)         | (43)         |\n| Net investment hedge derivatives - liabilities         | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            | -            |\n| Net asset hedging derivative instruments               | -            | (13)         | (13)         | -            | (43)         | (43)         |\n| FINANCIAL DEBT AFTER HEDGING                           | 1,100        | 8,737        | 9,837        | 192          | 8,830        | 9,022        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                              | (1,935)      | -            | (1,935)      | (2,078)      | -            | (2,078)      |\n| NET FINANCIAL DEBT EXCLUDING LEASE LIABILITIES         | (835)        | 8,737        | 7,902        | (1,886)      | 8,830        | 6,944        |\n| Lease liability                                        | 88           | 433          | 522          | 103          | 405          | 508          |\n| NET FINANCIAL DEBT                                     | (747)        | 9,171        | 8,424        | (1,783)      | 9,235        | 7,452        |",

The measurement is based on historical data (rating of counterparty banks and probability of default). At 30/uni00A0June 2021, theimpact was not significant.\n\n## Risk management 2.\n\nManagement and monitoring of financial risks is performed by the Financing and Treasury Department. Reporting to the Group Finance Department, it oversees all financial exposures and processes or validates all financing, investment and hedging transactions, as part of a programme approved by General Management.\n\nAll financial instruments used hedgeexisting or forecast hedge transactions or investments. They are contracted with a limited number of counterparties that have a first-class rating.\n\n## Managementof liquidity risk\n\nAt 30/uni00A0June 2021, the Group's cash and cash equivalents totalled \u20ac2,078/uni00A0million (compared with \u20ac1,935/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2020). An additional \u20ac3,360/uni00A0million of renewable medium-term credit facilities with banks was confirmed and undrawn. Group funding is provided in the form of long-term debt (bank loans, Bonds, etc.) and short-term financing (commercial paper and bank overdrafts) as well as factoring and securitisation, which provide adequate financial resources to ensure the continuity of its business. The Group also set up a \u20ac7/uni00A0billion EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme in May/uni00A02020. The Group's short-term financial debt after hedging was \u20ac349/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2021 (compared to \u20ac1,100/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2020).\n\nWhile the Group has not identified any other significant cash requirement, it cannot be fully guaranteed that it will be able to continue to access the funding and refinancing needed for its day-to-day operations and investments on satisfactory terms, given the uncertain economic context.\n\nThe credit ratings sought by Pernod Ricard from rating agencies on its long- and short-term debt are Baa1/P2 from Moody's and BBB+/A2 from Standard & Poor's, respectively.\n\nThe Group's bank and bond debt contracts include covenants and a financial ratio. Breaches of these covenants or financial ratio could force the Group to make accelerated payments. At 30/uni00A0June 2021, the Group was in compliance with the covenants under the terms ofits syndicated loan, with a solvency ratio (total Net debt converted at the average rate/consolidated EBITDA) of 5.25 or less.\n\nFurthermore, while the vast majority of the Group's cash surplus is placed with branches of global banks enjoying the highest agency ratings, it cannot be ruled out that these Group investments may lose some of their liquidity and/or value.\n\nThe currency controls in place in certain countries limit the Group's ability to use cash (prohibition on investment with the Group) and, in some cases, delay the possibility of paying dividends (authorisation is required from the relevant authorities, notably in Cuba). At 30/uni00A0June 2021, the delayed availability cashamounted to \u20ac138/uni00A0million, including \u20ac135/uni00A0million relating to Cuba. The monetary unification reform that led to the replacement of the convertible peso (CUC) by theCuban peso (CUP) from 1/uni00A0January 2021 has no material impact on the Group's financial statements at 30/uni00A0June 2021.\n\nSpecific terms of financing agreements and the schedule of financial liability maturity are respectively disclosed in the 'Material contracts' subsection of the management report and in/uni00A0Note/uni00A04.8 -Financial liabilities of the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Managementof currency risk\n\nAs the Group consolidates its financial statements in euros, it is exposed to fluctuations against the euro by the currencies in which its assets and liabilities are denominated (asset risk) or in/uni00A0which transactions are carried out (transaction risk and translation of results).\n\nWhile some hedging strategies allow exposure to be limited, there is no absolute protection against exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nFor asset risk, financing foreign currency-denominated assets acquired by the Group with debt in the same currency provides natural hedging. This principle was applied for the acquisition of Seagram, Allied Domecq and Vin&Sprit, with part of the debt being denominated in USD, reflecting the importance of cash flows generated in dollars or linked currencies.\n\nMovements in currencies against the euro (notably the USD) may/uni00A0impact the nominal amount of these debts and the financial expenses published in euros in the consolidated financial statements, and this could adversely affect the Group's results.\n\nFor operational currency risk, the Group's international operations expose it to currency risks affecting transactions carried out by affiliates in a currency other than their operating currency (transaction accounting risk).\n\nAs a rule, it is Group policy to invoice end customers in the functional currency of the distributing entity. Exposure to currency risk on invoicing between producer and distributor affiliates is managed via a monthly payment centralisation procedure involving most countries with freely convertible and transferable currencies and whose internal legislation allows this participation. This system hedges against net exposure using forward exchange contracts.\n\nResidual risk is partially hedged using financial derivatives (forward purchases, forward sales or options) to hedge certain or highly probable non-Group operating receivables and payables.\n\nIn addition, the Group may use firm or optional hedges with the aim of reducing the impact of currency fluctuations on its operating activities in some Brand Companies that make significant purchases in currencies other than the euro especially USD, GBP or SEK - or in order to secure the payment of dividends back to the parent.",

It is recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item is itself recognised in profit and loss. The change in value of the ineffective component of the derivative is however recognised directly in profit and loss.Ifthe derivative is designated as a hedge of a net foreign currency investment, thechange in value of the 'effective' portion of the hedgeis recognised in shareholders' equity and the change in value of the 'ineffective' portion is recognised in profit and loss.\n\n## Counterparty risk in financial transactions\n\nThe Group could be exposed to counterparty default via its cash investments, hedging instruments or the availability of confirmed but undrawn financing lines. In order to limit this exposure, the Group performs a rigorous selection of counterparties according to several criteria, including credit ratings, and depending on the maturity dates of the transactions.\n\nHowever, no assurance can be given that this rigorous selection will be enough to protect the Group against risks of this type, particularly in the current economic context.",

fair values are fixed upon implementation of each plan and do not vary year on year. In addition, only thevalues relating to the plans allocated during FY21 are presented above (information on previous plans is available in the previous universal registration documents).\n\nFrom 2012 onwards, the volatility assumption used for the plans is based on a multi-criteria approach taking into consideration:\n\n- historic volatility over a period equal to the duration of the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> options;\n- implied volatility calculated on the basis of options available in glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> financial markets.",

In 2017, a new option exercise profile was defined and replaced that established in 2010.It was assumed that 30%, 40% and 30% of the options would be exercised once the share price reached 120%, 150%and 180% of the exercise price respectively. This assumption is based on a recent analysis of behaviour observed on plans awarded before 2017.\n\nOptions allocated on 27/uni00A0November2020 are all conditional on the positioning of the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR/uni00A0 (1) ) compared with the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers: the stock options will be pre-vested on 27/uni00A0November 2023, provided that the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR/uni00A0 (1) ) is positioned 7 th 7 7 /uni00A0out of 13 or better (the number will be determined in increments depending on the level of performance achieved). Vesting will be finalif the continuous service conditionis met on 27/uni00A0November 2024.\n\nTwo performance share plans were granted on 27/uni00A0November 2020. In one case, the fair value corresponds, amongst other things, to the market price of the shares at the grant date, less the loss of expected dividends during the vesting period ( i.e. four years for all beneficiaries). Lastly, the number of performance shares granted will depend on the average level of Group Profit from recurring operations for the financial years ended 30/uni00A0June 2021, 30/uni00A0June 2022 and 30/uni00A0June 2023 compared with budgeted Profit from Recurring Operations for each of those financial years,at constant exchangerates and scope of consolidation. The accounting expense for the plan under IFRS/uni00A02 will be adjusted for this condition no later than the end of the vesting period.\n\nThe fair value of the other plan takes account of the same market performance condition as applied to the stock options allocated on 27/uni00A0November2020: positioning of the overall performance of the Pernod Ricard share (TSR/uni00A0 (1) ) compared with the overall performance of a panel of 12 peers over the period from 27/uni00A0November 2020 to 27/uni00A0November 2023 inclusive (three years). Vesting will be final as of 28/uni00A0November 2024 if the continuous service conditionis met on 27/uni00A0November2024.\n\n## Off-balance sheet commitments Note/uni00A06.3\n\n| \u20ac million                                                      | Total   | < 1/uni00A0year   | > 1/uni00A0year and </uni00A05/uni00A0years   | > 5/uni00A0years   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Commitments given at 30.06.2020                                | 2,367   | 851               | 1,316                                         | 200                |\n| Commitments given in relation to companies within the Group    | 5       | 3                 | 2                                             | -                  |\n| Investment commitments                                         | 5       | 3                 | 2                                             | -                  |\n| Commitments given as part of specific transactions             | -       | -                 | -                                             | -                  |\n| Other items                                                    | -       | -                 | -                                             | -                  |\n| Commitments given in relation to the financing of the Company  | 25      | 8                 | 11                                            | 6                  |\n| Financial guarantees given                                     | 25      | 8                 | 11                                            | 6                  |\n| Other items                                                    | -       | -                 | -                                             | -                  |\n| Commitments relating to the operating activities of the issuer | 2,337   | 841               | 1,303                                         | 194                |\n| Firm and irrevocable commitments to purchase raw materials     | 1,972   | 576               | 1,275                                         | 121                |\n| Tax commitments (customs guarantees and others)                | 309     | 228               | 9                                             | 71                 |\n| Operating lease agreements                                     | 8       | 3                 | 3                                             | 1                  |\n| Other items                                                    | 49      | 33                | 15                                            | 1                  |",

        "page_content": "## Lines of credit received and not used 1.\n\nThe lines of credit received and not used correspond primarilyto the nominal amounts of thesyndicated loan and a bilateral credit line not drawn at 30/uni00A0June 2021 (see Note/uni00A04.8 Financial liabilities ).\n\n## Contingent liabilities Note/uni00A06.4\n\nPernod Ricard has received several notices of tax adjustment for the financial years 2007 to 2016, specifically concerning,foran amount of 8,231/uni00A0million Indian rupees (equivalent to \u20ac93.2/uni00A0million, including interest as of the date of the reassessment), the tax deductibility of promotion and advertising expenses. It should be noted that the level and amount of this risk have been gradually and significantly reduced in recent years and that the Company obtained two court rulings in its favour in FY20 for the period\n\nfrom FY07 to FY14. These court decisions further strengthen Pernod Ricard India's position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses. Reassured by these decisions and after consulting with its tax advisers, Pernod Ricard India will continue to dispute the merits of the reassessment proposal and believes it has a probable chance of success in litigation. Accordingly, no provision has been booked for this matter.\n\n## Disputes Note/uni00A06.5\n\nIn the normal course of business, Pernod Ricard is involved in a number of individual and group legal, governmental, arbitration and administrative proceedings.\n\nA provision for such procedures is constituted under 'Other provisions for risks and charges' (see Note/uni00A04.7 Provisions ) only when it is likely that a current liability stemming from a past event will require thepayment of an amount that can be reliably estimated. In the latter case, the provisioned amount corresponds to the best estimation ofthe risk. The provisioned amount recorded is based on the assessment of the level of risk on a case by case basis, it being understood that any events arising during the proceedings may at any time require that risk to be reassessed.\n\nThe provisions recorded by Pernod Ricard at 30/uni00A0June 2021 for all litigation and risks in which it is involved amounted to \u20ac366/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac431/uni00A0million at 30/uni00A0June 2020 (see Note/uni00A04.7 -Provisions ), excluding uncertain tax positions recognised in current tax liabilities. Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other than in exceptional circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no other governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings pending or threatened, including any proceeding of which the Company is aware, which may have or have had over the last six months a significant impact on the profitability of the Company and/or the Group, other than those described below.\n\n## Disputes relating to brands\n\n## Havana Club\n\nThe Havana Club brand is owned in most countries by a joint venture company called Havana Club Holding/uni00A0SA (HCH), of which Pernod Ricard is a shareholder, and is registered in over 160/uni00A0countries in which the Havana Club rum is distributed. In the United States, this brand is owned by a Cuban company (Cubaexport). Ownership of this brand is currently being challenged in the United States by a competitor of Pernod Ricard.\n\nIn1998, the United States passed a law relating to the conditions for the protection of brands previously used by nationalised companies. This law was condemned by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2002. However, to date, the United States has not amended its legislation to comply with theWTO decision.\n\n- The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) 1. decided that this law had the effect of preventing any renewal of theUS trademark registration for the Havana Club brand, which, in the United States, has been owned by Cubaexport since 1976, without obtaining a specific licence from OFAC. In August/uni00A02006,the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) denied the renewal of the said Havana Club trademark registration, following OFAC's refusal to grant a specific licence. Cubaexport petitioned the Director of the USPTO to reverse this decision and also filed a claim against the OFAC, challenging both OFAC's decision and the law and regulations applied by OFAC. In March/uni00A02009, the US District Court for the District of Columbia ruled against Cubaexport. In March/uni00A02011, in a two-to-one decision, the Court of Appeals blocked Cubaexport from renewing its trademark. A certiorari petition was filed before the US Supreme Court on 27/uni00A0January 2012, with the support of the French government, the National Foreign Trade Council and the Washington Legal Foundation. On 14/uni00A0May 2012, the Supreme Court denied the petition. In November/uni00A02015, Cubaexport again applied for a specific licence from OFAC to renew the trademark in the United States. On 11/uni00A0January 2016, OFAC granted Cubaexport's licence application and on 13/uni00A0January 2016, the application to the Director of USPTO was declared admissible and the trademark was renewed for the 10-year period ending on 27/uni00A0January 2016. A request for a further renewal for a period of 10/uni00A0years from 27/uni00A0January 2016 was also granted.\n- A competitor of the Group has petitioned theUSPTO to 2. cancel the Havana Club trademark registration inthe United States. In January/uni00A02004, the USPTO denied the petition and refused to cancel the trademark registration. Asthis decision was appealed, proceedings are now ongoing before the Federal District Court for theDistrict ofColumbia. These proceedings were stayed pending the outcome of Cubaexport's petition to the USPTO. Following acceptance of the petition by theDirector of theUSPTO, these judicial proceedings resumed and the plaintiff amended the complaint. In response, Cubaexport and HCH filed two motions in 2016: one to dismiss all actions commenced against them and one to expedite proceedings on certain issues. Both applications have been fully disclosed and are awaiting a decision by the Court.\n\n## Firm and irrevocable commitments 2. to/uni00A0purchase raw materials\n\nInthe context of their cognac, wine, champagne and whiskies production, the Group's main affiliates have signed raw material supply agreements, mainly for eaux-de-vie , grapes, base wines and grain.",

        "page_content": "These risks constitute a potential obstacle to the Group's business development but there are no foreseeable obligations resulting from these events at the present time. The resolution of these disputes would represent a business development opportunity for the Group.\n\n## Taxdisputes\n\nThe Group's companies are regularly audited by the tax authorities in the countries in which they are registered.\n\nThe estimation of the risk concerning each dispute is regularly reviewed by theaffiliate or region concerned and by the Group's Tax Department, with the assistance of external counsel for the most significant or complex cases.Provisions are recognised if necessary.Pernod Ricard provides no further details (other than in exceptional circumstances), as disclosing the amount of any provision for ongoing tax litigation could cause the Group serious harm.\n\n## India\n\nPernod Ricard India (P)/uni00A0Ltd has an ongoing dispute with the Indian customs authorities over the declared transaction value of concentrates of alcoholic beverages (CAB) imported into India. Customs are challenging the transaction values, arguing that some competitors used different values for the import of similar goods. This matter was ruled on by the Supreme Court which issued an order in July/uni00A02010, setting out the principles applicable for the determination of values which should be taken into account for the calculation of duty. Pernod Ricard India (P)/uni00A0Ltd has already paid the corresponding amounts up to 2001. For the period between 2001 and December/uni00A02010, Pernod Ricard India (P)/uni00A0Ltd has paid almost the entire differential duty as determined by customs in Delhi following the initial adjustment notice received in 2011. A second notice, received in 2013 and confirmed by a court on 14/uni00A0August 2017 has been suspended by the Supreme Court. The Company continues to actively work with the authorities and courts to resolve pending issues.\n\nPernod Ricard India (P) is also involved in a debate with the Indian customs authorities over the transaction value of international products imported into India. Discussions are ongoing with therelevant authorities and jurisdictions.\n\nMoreover, Pernod Ricard India (P) received several notices of tax adjustment for FY07 to FY16 relating to the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses (see Note/uni00A06.4 Contingent liabilities ). In FY20, Pernod Ricard India (P) obtained two court rulings in its favour in FY20 for the period fromFY07 to FY14, strengthening its position on the tax deductibility of advertising and promotional expenses.\n\nIt should be noted that the above-mentioned disputes are only the subject of provisions, which, where appropriate, are recorded in other provisions for risks and charges (see Note/uni00A04.5 -Provisions ) or in current tax liabilities (see Note/uni00A03.3 Corporate income tax ), x when it is probable that a present obligation resulting from a past event will require a settlement the amount of which can be reliably estimated.The amount of the provision is the best estimate of the outflow of resources required to extinguish this liability.\n\n## Commercial disputes\n\n## Colombia\n\nTwo separate complaints were filed before the Colombian Competition Agency (the Superintendencia De Industria Y Comercio) on 14/uni00A0November 2017 by the Department of Cundinamarca (Colombia) and its wholly owned distilling company Empresa de Licores de Cundinamarca against Pernod Ricard/uni00A0SA, Pernod Ricard Colombia/uni00A0SA and a competitor company. An additional complaint was filed in September/uni00A02019 by the departments of Valle and Antioquia (as well as its wholly-owned distillation companies).The complaint alleges that the defendants have committed violations of the Colombian Unfair Competition Act and, in particular, articles/uni00A07 and 18 thereof,through theillegal import of spirits into Colombia. The complaint alleges that the companies have gained an unfair market advantage over local producers through such activity. The plaintiffs seek damages corresponding to the loss of profits and taxes over the period 2013/17 (2019 in the case of Valle and Antioquia).\n\nPernod Ricard intends to vigorously defend itself against these allegations. These recent complaints contain allegations that are similar to those made in prior legal proceedingsbefore theNew York courts brought by Cundinamarca, the Republic of Colombia and several other Colombian departments in 2004. The New York proceedings were dismissed voluntarily by the parties in 2012.\n\n## Related parties Note/uni00A06.6\n\nTransactions with associates and joint ventures were immaterial in the financial year ended 30/uni00A0June 2021.\n\nThe compensation paid to corporate officers and Executive Committee (COMEX) members in return for their services to the Group is detailed below:\n\n| \u20ac million                                                        | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Board of Directors (1)                                           | 1            | 1            |\n| Group Executive Committee                                        |              |              |\n| Short-term benefits glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>              | 15           | 10           |\n| Post-employment benefits glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>         | 5            | 2            |\n| Share-based payments/uni00A0 (2) glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> | 5            | 5            |\n| TOTAL EXPENSES RECOGNISED FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR                 | 26           | 19           |\n\nMoreover, the Executive Director is eligible for the following termination compensation :\n\n- one-year non-compete clause, together with a payment glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> corresponding to 12/uni00A0months' compensation;\n\n- imposed departure clause subject to performance conditions, glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> together with a maximum payment corresponding to 12/uni00A0months' compensation.\n\nThese clauses were not implemented in the course of the past financial year.",

Control is the power to influence the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities, irrespective of the percentage held in the entity. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated affiliates are presented separately from Parent Company shareholders' equity. Non-controlling interests include both the\n\ninterests of minority shareholders at the date of the original business combination and minority interests in any subsequent changes to shareholders' equity.\n\nIntragroup transactions and internal profits and losses relating to consolidated companies are eliminated.\n\nCompanies over which the Group exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\n\n## Consolidation scope Note/uni00A07.1\n\nThe main changes to the Group's scope of consolidation at 30/uni00A0June 2021are presented in Note/uni00A01.2 Significant events during the financial year .",

Their recoverable amount is determined as part of mandatory annual impairment tests given their indefinite life and/or specific tests required in the event of an indication of a loss in value. Recoverable amounts are generally determined based on discounted future cash flow calculations and involve significant management judgments of components such as price and volume growth rates, the timing of future operating expenses and discount and long-term growth rates.\n\nIn certain countries, difficult trade conditions impacted the performance and future outlook of certain CGUs, leading the Company to record an impairment loss before tax of \u20ac72/uni00A0million for the year ended 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021, as disclosed in Notes/uni00A03.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- assessing the principles and methods of calculating CGUs' glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> accounting and recoverable amounts;\n- testing the operation of Group controls covering the calculation of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> CGUs' recoverable amounts;\n- for CGUs with a recoverable amount close to their carrying amount glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> ('sensitive brands' CGUs'), confirming the results of the valuation model used by management by comparing them with the results of our models;\n- corroborating the reasonableness of the main data and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> assumptions underlying the estimates (such as the discount rates and long-term growth rates), primarily for 'sensitive brands' CGUs', especially with regard to available market analyses and in relation to economic environments where the Group operates;\n- being informed of the commercial outlook of the brands based on glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> interviews with management and comparing the accounting estimates of prior period cash flow projections with corresponding actual values to assess reliability;\n- testing the arithmetical accuracy of the valuations used by the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> Company on a sample basis;\n- assessing management's sensitivity analysis on recoverable glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> amounts to changes in main assumptions.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02020 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05/uni00A0(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments/uni00A0- Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing,and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travelrestrictions and remote working,have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce ') relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as/uni00A0well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, approved in the conditions mentioned above, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separateopinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\nFurthermore, the sensitivity of CGUs' recoverable amounts to assumptions was analysed by management and presented in Note/uni00A04.1. Changes in these assumptions could give rise to further impairment losses.\n\nConsidering the weight of brands on the balance sheet, the complexity of the models used and their sensitivity to changes in the data and assumptions underlying the estimates, particularly cash flow forecasts and discount rates used, we considered the recoverable amount of brands to be a key audit matter presenting a risk of material misstatement.\n\n## Tax risk\n\n(Notes/uni00A01.1.4, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4 and 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nThe Group operates in numerous different tax jurisdictions. The tax authorities of the countries in which the Group companies operate regularly have queries on issues relating to their everyday activities. Tax audits can therefore give rise to tax reassessments and litigation with these tax authorities. The assessment of the risk related to each tax litigation is regularly reviewed by each concerned subsidiary or region and by the Group's tax department, with the support of its external counsels for the most significant and complex litigations. Part of the amount of provisions for contingences for all legal disputes or risks involving the Group relate to tax risks and litigation.\n\nMore particularly, the Indian subsidiary is involved in disputes with customs and tax authorities over, among others, the declared transaction value of imported products into India and the tax deductibility of promotional and advertising expenses. As indicated in the Note/uni00A06.5 'Disputes', the reassessment proposals are only the subject of provisions or income tax payables where appropriate, when it is likely that a current liability resulting from a past event will require an outflow of resources which can be reliably estimated. Given the Group's exposure to tax issues, which are in part specific to its business sector, and the high level of management judgment in estimating the risks and amounts recorded, we considered tax risks to be a key audit matter and the understatement of the corresponding provisions to be a possible source of material misstatement in the financial statements.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group'sinformation given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article/uni00A0L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce ') is included in the Group's information given in the management report, it being specified that, in/uni00A0accordance with the provisions of Article/uni00A0L.823-10 of the code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and this information should be reported by an independent third party.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes/uni00A01.1.4, 3.1 and 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements and verified the arithmetical accuracy of the presented sensitivity analysis.\n\nBased on discussions with management, we have been informed of the procedures implemented by the Group to identify uncertain tax positions and, where necessary, provide for tax risks or income tax payables.\n\nIn addition, we assessed the judgments made by management in evaluating the probability of taxes being payable, the amount of potential exposure and the reasonableness of the estimates adopted for provisions for tax risks or income tax payables. We particularly focused on the impact of changes in local tax regulations and ongoing audits conducted by local tax authorities.\n\nTo assess whether the tax liabilities were appropriately recognized, and with the assistance of our tax experts, we:\n\n- conducted interviews with the Group's tax department and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> regional and local management teams in order to assess the current state of the investigations and reassessments made by tax authorities and monitor the development of ongoing tax disputes;\n- consulted the recent Group company decisions and glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> correspondence with local tax authorities, and reviewed the correspondence between the relevant companies and their lawyers, where necessary;\n- analyzed lawyers' responses to our information requests; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- performed a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> by management;\n- assessed whether the latest developments were taken into glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> account in the provisions recorded in the balance sheet. We also assessed the disclosures in Notes/uni00A01.1.4, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, 6.4\n\nand 6.5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## FORMAT OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article/uni00A0L.451-1-2,/uni00A0I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), r r prepared under the responsibility of the Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation N\u00b0/uni00A02019/815 of 17/uni00A0December/uni00A02018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we concludethat the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (' Code de commerce '), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- Identifies and assesses the risksof material misstatement of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis forhis opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company'sability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> financial statementsand assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsiblefor the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.",

This production of algorithms falls within the scope of the accounting regulations for internally generated intangible assets. Development costs are recognised as intangible assets from the date on which the technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the human and material resources are sufficient to produce these tools. The amount recognised as intangible assets relating to these projects was \u20ac5.7/uni00A0million for FY21. The amortisation period is five years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment 2.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is initially measured at cost (purchase/uni00A0price plus ancillary costs but not including fees incurred in connection with asset purchases). Impairment is calculated using the straight-line or declining-balance methods, on the basis of the estimated useful lives of the assets:\n\n- buildings: between20 and 50/uni00A0years (straight line); glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- fixtures and fittings: 10/uni00A0years (straight line); glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- machinery and equipment: 5/uni00A0years (straight line); glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- office furniture and equipment: 10/uni00A0years (straight line) or glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> 4/uni00A0years (reducing balance).\n\n## Financial assets 3.\n\nThe gross value of investments is composed of their acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf the value in use of investments is lower than their acquisition cost, a/uni00A0provision for impairment is recognised in financial income/(expense) for/uni00A0the amount of the difference.\n\nPernod Ricard mainly uses two methods to estimate the value in use of its equity investments:\n\n- the enterprise value of the main securities is estimated on the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> basis of the most recent estimate of the revalued net asset value, by identifying in particular the unrealised capital gains on assets held by the affiliates, such as the brands. The revalued net assets of these entities are estimated using\n\nmethods such as discounted future cash flows. The term of the cash flow projections reflects the characteristics of the Group's brands and their production assets. Discounted projected cash flows are established based on annual budgets and/uni00A0multi-year strategies, extrapolated into subsequent years by gradually converging the figure for the last year of the plan for each brand and market towards a perpetual growth rate. The calculation includes a terminal value derived by capitalising the cash flows generated in the last forecast year;\n\n- for other equity investments, the value in use is estimated glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> based on the share of equity of the affiliate that these securities represent.\n\n## Receivables 4.\n\nReceivables are recognised at their nominal value. A provision is recognised in the event that their value falls below the net carrying amount at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Marketable securities 5.\n\nThis item includes the treasury shares acquired for the allocation of stockoption and performance share plans from the time of acquisition.\n\nAliability is recognised when it becomes probablethat the rights to receive the marketable securities concerned under the plans will be exercised. For other marketable securities, an impairment provision is recognised when the cost price is higher than the market price.\n\n## Bonds 6.\n\nRedemption premiums are amortised over the life of the loans.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges 7.\n\nProvisions for risks and charges are recognised in accordance with French Accounting Regulation/uni00A02000-06 on liabilities, issued on 7/uni00A0December 2000 by the French Accounting Regulatory Committee (CRC).\n\nThis accounting regulation provides that a liability be recognised when an entity has an obligation towards a third party and that it is probable or certain that this obligation will cause an outflow of resources to thethird party without equivalent consideration being received. A present obligation must exist at the balance sheet date for a provision to be recognised.\n\n## Pensions and other long-term employee 8. benefits\n\nSince the year ended on 30/uni00A0June 2014, the Company has opted to recognise the full liability for pensions and other long-term employee benefits in the balance sheet, as provided by recommendation 2013-02. At 30/uni00A0June 2021, the provision for pensions and other long-term employee benefits was \u20ac63/uni00A0million.\n\n## Translation of foreign 9. currency-denominated items\n\nPayables, receivables and cash balances denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- translation of all payables, receivables and cash balances glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> denominated in foreign currencies at year-end rates;\n- recognition of a provision for currency risk for any unrealised glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> currency losses, aftertaking into account the effect ofany offsetting foreign exchange hedging transactions.",

        "page_content": "The present value of employee benefit obligations is calculated using the prospective method involving the calculation of a projected salary at the retirement date (projected unit credit method).The measurement is made at each balance sheet date and the personal data concerning employees is revised at least every three years. The calculationrequires the use of economic assumptions (inflation rate and discount rate) and/uni00A0assumptions concerning employees (mainly average salary increase, rate of employee turnoverand life expectancy).\n\nAt 30/uni00A0June 2021, the total amount of benefit obligations was \u20ac63/uni00A0million. These obligations are fully provisioned.\n\nFor information, the inflation rate used for the valuation at 30/uni00A0June 2021 was 1.75% and the discount rate was 0.75%.\n\nPlan assets are measured at their market value at each balance sheet date.\n\n## Accounting for actuarial gains and losses\n\nActuarial gains and losses arise primarily when estimates differ from actual outcomes, or when there are changes in long-term actuarial assumptions ( e.g. discount rate, rate of increase of salaries, etc.).\n\nThe Company has applied the option set out in recommendation 2013-02, in which the full pension liability is recognised, since the financial year ended 30/uni00A0June 2014.\n\n## Components of the expense recognised for the financial year\n\nThe expense recognised in respect of the benefit obligations described above incorporates:\n\n- expenses corresponding tothe acquisition of an additional glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> year's rights;\n- interest expense arising on the unwinding of the discount glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> applied to vested rights at the start of theyear (as a resultof the passage of time);\n- income corresponding to the expected return on plan assets glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> measured using the discount rate which is used to measure plan liabilities;\n- income or expense corresponding to actuarial gains or losses; glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT>\n- income or expense related to changes to existing plans or the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> creation of new plans;\n- the income or expense related to any plan curtailments or glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> settlements.\n\n## Deferred income and adjustment accounts Note/uni00A010\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                                  | At 30.06.2020   | Increases   | Decreases   | At 30.06.2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Deferred income                               | 21,719          | -           | (2,730)     | 18,989          |\n| Unrealised foreign exchange gains/uni00A0 (1) | 468,419         | 124,000     | (468,419)   | 124,000         |\n| TOTAL                                         | 490,138         | 124,000     | (471,149)   | 142,989         |\n\n## Accrued income and/uni00A0expenses Note/uni00A011\n\n## Accrued income\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                                                  | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Amount of accrued income in the following balance sheet items |              |              |\n| Loans and advances to affiliates and associates               | 257,055      | 53,536       |\n| Trade receivables                                             | 273,788      | 338,459      |\n| Other receivables                                             | 1,921,251    | 1,036,227    |\n| Cash                                                          | 630,753      | 93,029       |\n| TOTAL                                                         | 3,082,847    | 1,521,251    |\n\n## Accrued expenses\n\n| (\u20ac thousand)                                                    | 30.06.2020   | 30.06.2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Amount of accrued expenses in the following balance sheet items |              |              |\n| Bank debts                                                      | -            | -            |\n| Trade payables                                                  | 95,483       | 148,218      |\n| Taxes and social payables                                       | 35,913       | 62,721       |\n| Other payables                                                  | 348,628      | 1,065,925    |\n| TOTAL                                                           | 480,024      | 1,276,864    |",

Shareholders' Meeting,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders' Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Pernod Ricard for the year ended 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as of 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance withFrench accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## AUDIT FRAMEWORK\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the ' Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements ' section of our report.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Responses as part of our audit\n\n## Valuation of investments\n\n(Notes/uni00A01.3 and 3 to the financial statements)\n\nAs at 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021, consolidated and non-consolidated investments are recorded in the balance sheet at a net carrying amount of \u20ac12,953/uni00A0million and represent 87% of total assets. They are initially recognised at acquisition cost, excluding ancillary costs.\n\nIf the value in use of investments is lower than their net carrying amount, a provision for impairment is recognised in financial income/(expense) in the amount of the difference. As disclosed in Note/uni00A01.3 to the financial statements, value in use is determined based on two methodologies:\n\n- The enterprise value of the main investments is based on the most glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> recent estimate of the adjusted net asset value, by identifying unrealized capital gains on assets owned by the subsidiaries, such as brands. The adjusted net asset value is assessed based on methods such as the discounted cash flows method.\n- For other investments, value in use is estimated based on the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> share of the subsidiary's equity represented by the investment.\n\nEstimates of the value in use of these investments are based on complex valuation models for subsidiaries which in turn own several subsidiaries and require management to exercise significant judgment (particularly regarding cash flow assumptions and taking into consideration asset revaluations).\n\nGiven the weight of investments in the balance sheet, the complexity of the models used and their sensitivity to changes in the data and assumptions underlying estimates, we considered the determination\n\nof the value in use of investments to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the Company's controls covering the process for determining the value in use of investments. Our other procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- verifying, based on information communicated to us, that the glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> values in use for investments estimated by management are supported by appropriate documentation of the valuation method and amounts used;\n- obtaining and analysing the valuation report on certain glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> investments produced by the Company's external valuation advisors;\n- comparing data used in investment impairment tests with source glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> documents by entity and the results of our audit procedures on these subsidiaries;\n- sample testing the arithmetical accuracy of values in use adopted glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> by the Company.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of disclosures in Note/uni00A01.3 to the financial statements.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors, for the period from 1/uni00A0July/uni00A02020 to the date of our report,and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article/uni00A05/uni00A0(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments/uni00A0- Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of thestateof sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing,and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risksof material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-11 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or/uni00A0Information\n\n## FORMAT OF PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0451-1-2,/uni00A0I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), r r prepared under the responsibility of the ChiefExecutive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation n\u00b0/uni00A02019/815 of 17/uni00A0December/uni00A02018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Pernod Ricard/uni00A0S.A. by the Shareholders' Meeting of 13/uni00A0May/uni00A02003 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and 17/uni00A0November/uni00A02016 for KPMG/uni00A0S.A.\n\nAsof 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9sand KPMG/uni00A0S.A.were in the 18 th /uni00A0year and 5 th /uni00A0year of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting standards, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company'sability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal controland risk management systems and, where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of/uni00A0the Financial Statements\n\n## OBJECTIVE AND AUDIT APPROACH\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.",

If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify theopinion expressed therein;\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit.

For the other beneficiaries, the weighting would be as follows: 80% of the allocations would be subject to the internal PRO performance conditionand 20% would be subject to the internal CSRperformance condition.\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided to align the performance conditions of the Company's Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee combining internal and external conditions and by also including a corporate responsibility criterion, taking into account the importance of the Group's roadmap in this area. For other beneficiaries, it also appeared important to introduce a corporate responsibility criterionin addition to the PRO criterion to which they were previouslysubject.\n\nThe vesting period for theshares would be of at least three years.\n\nThis authorisation would be valid for a period of 38 months from the date of the Shareholders Meeting. During this period, it would permit the allocation of performance-based shares representing a maximum of 1.5% of the Company'sshare capital at the date of the Board of Directors' decision to allocate such shares. Moreover, the number of performance-based shares allocated to the Company'sExecutive Directors shall not exceed 0.08% of the Company's share capital at the date of the Board of Directors' decision to allocate such shares, which amount would be deducted from the aforementioned ceiling of 1.5% of the Company's share capital. This sub-ceiling has been slightly increased compared to the last authorisation of the Shareholders Meeting to take into account the fact that stock options will no longer be allocated to Executive Directors.\n\nUnder the 23 rd resolution , the definitive allocation of shares free of charge would be subject to a presence condition but without any performance condition. The Board of Directors wished to have a tool for rewarding, and retaining the Group's talents while at the same time making them interested in the Company'sshare performance, but also for attracting new talents, thus aligning with market practices in order to remain competitive. Consequently, these allocations would be made: (i) on the occasion of recruitment as part of our policy to attract new talents but also (ii) to reward and retain certain employees.\n\nThe Company'sExecutive Directors would not benefit from any allocation within the framework of this authorisation. The members of the Company's Executive Committee would also be excluded from the benefit of any allocation within the framework of this authorisation, except on the occasion of their recruitment in accordance with our policy of attracting new talents.\n\nThe vesting period for theshares would be of at least three years.\n\nThis authorisation by theShareholders Meeting would be valid for a period of 38 months from the date of theShareholders Meeting. During this period, it could give rise to the allocation of shares free ofcharge representing a maximum of 0.5% of the Company's share capital at the date of the Board of Directors' decision to allocate such shares.\n\nThe 24 th /uni00A0and 25 th 5 5 /uni00A0resolutions propose delegations of authority granted to the Board of Directors by the Shareholders' Meeting in order to allow the Board of Directors to set up an employee shareholding plan in France and abroad.\n\nSuch a shareholding plan could be set up in particular to facilitate access to the Company's share capital for a large numberof the Group's employees and to align their interests with those of shareholders.\n\nMore precisely, the 24 th /uni00A0resolution allows capital increases reserved for employees and/or Executive Directors who are members of a company savings plan within the Group.The purpose of the 25 th 5 5 resolution is to allow employees and corporate officers in certain countries outside of France to subscribe to Company shares with similar benefits in terms of economic profile to those offered to employees in the 24 th resolution, in/uni00A0particular, when local legal and/or tax constraints make the implementation of the employee shareholding plan in the context of the 24 th resolution impossible or difficult.\n\nIt is stated that these delegations of authority allow share capital increases and that they could not be used during a public offering for Company shares.",

The/uni00A0deduction is no longer mandatory when the legal reserve reaches an amount equal to one-tenth of theshare capital. It once again becomes mandatory in the event that, for whatever reason, this reserve falls below one-tenth of theshare capital.\n\nFor the first distributable profit (dividend) as determined in accordance with the law, an amount corresponding to 6% of the fully paid up share is deducted, subject to the possibility that the Board of Directors authorises shareholders who request to do so to pay up their shares in advance, it being specified that the payments cannot give rise to entitlement to the aforementioned initial dividend.\n\nThis initial dividend is not cumulative, i.e. if profits for the financial year are not sufficient to makethis payment or are only sufficient to make thepayment in part,theshareholders cannot claim this on profits generated in the following financial year.\n\nFrom the available surplus, theOrdinary Shareholders' Meeting maydecide to deduct all amounts it considers appropriate, either to be carried forward to the following financial year or to be transferred to extraordinary or special reserves, with or without special allocations.\n\nThe balance is distributed among shareholders as an additional dividend.\n\nTheOrdinary Shareholders' Meeting is authorised to distribute non-statutory reserves set up in previous years any amounts that it considers should be either:\n\n- distributed to theshareholders or allocated to total or partial glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> depreciation of theshares; or\n- accumulated or used for the repurchase and cancellation of glyph<c=1,font=/AAFOBE+ArialMT> shares.\n\nWholly depreciated shares are replaced by dividend right certificates granting the same rights as the existing shares, with/uni00A0the exception of entitlement to the initial statutory dividend and capital repayment.\n\nDividend payment terms and conditions are fixed by the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting or, failing that, by the Board of/uni00A0Directors within the maximum period set by law.\n\nIn deliberating on the financial statements for the financial year, the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting has the option to grant each shareholder the choice between a cash or stock dividend, for all or part of a dividend or interim dividend payment.\n\nDividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months following the year end.This period may be extended by court ruling. Dividends will be transferred to the French State after the/uni00A0statutory period, i.e. five years.\n\n## Changes in the share capital and/uni00A0the/uni00A0rights/uni00A0attached to/uni00A0shares 9.1.10\n\nAny changes in the share capital or the voting rights attached to the shares making up the share capital shall be governed by the/uni00A0standard legal provisions as the bylaws do not contain any specific provisions in this respect.\n\n## TheStatutory Auditors 9.1.11\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s, member of the CompagnieR\u00e9gionale des Commissaires aux Comptes de Versailles (Versailles regional auditors' association), represented by Mr/uni00A0David Dupont-No\u00ebl, whose registered office is at TSA 20303, 92030 La D\u00e9fense Cedex, reappointed by the Shareholders' Meeting of 19/uni00A0November 2017 for a term of six financial years, which will end after the Shareholders' Meeting to be convened in 2023 to approve the preceding year's financial statements.\n\nKPMG/uni00A0SA, member of the Compagnie R\u00e9gionale des Commissaires aux Comptes de Versailles (Versailles regional auditors' association), represented by Ms/uni00A0Caroline Bruno-Diaz and Mr/uni00A0\u00c9ric Ropert, whose registered office is at TourEqho, 2,/uni00A0avenue Gambetta, 92066 Paris - La D\u00e9fense Cedex, and whose term of office as passed by the Shareholders' Meeting of 17/uni00A0November 2016 will end after the Shareholders' Meeting to be convened in 2022 to approve the preceding year's financial statements.\n\n## Fees of Statutory Auditors and members of their networks\n\nThe fees of the Statutory Auditors and members of their networks for the 12-month financial year are set out in Note/uni00A06.8 Fees of Statutory Auditors and members of their networks for the 12-month financial year in Section/uni00A06 'Consolidated financial statements' of this universal registration document.",
