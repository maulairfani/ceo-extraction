It's fair to ask whether there is still a role for co-operatives and the co-operative model in this reality.\n\nWe think that now, more than ever, there is a clear and compelling role for co-operatives like us. Vancity continues to show the strong difference a co-operative can make - and how being a co-operative is so central to shaping Vancity as a truly different financial institution.\n\nDuring these difficult times, rather than turning people away, we see it as our role and responsibility to ask 'how can we help?' That's been our approach throughout this challenging period.\n\nWhen members needed our help to deal with the impacts of the pandemic or of extreme weather events on their personal finances or their business, we listened to their unique needs and provided solutions. For example, we proactively reached out to members who might have been affected by flooding, and helped facilitate access to cash or credit if needed. We also deployed our Humanitarian Fund to help communities impacted by flooding or forest fires, including several Indigenous communities that were particularly hard hit.\n\nThose steps made a big difference, and it's our employees who made it happen. Our employees also needed us - to ensure a safe environment in which to continue delivering an essential service to members, and to help them deal with the same challenges so many of us have been facing outside work. As successive waves of COVID-19 variants brought shifts in public health measures, our employees' health and safety were (and continue to be) paramount for the Board.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 has also intersected with both economic inequality and the effects of systemic racism, oppression and colonialism.\n\nThese systemic challenges are other areas where co-operatives can make a difference, and where Vancity has sought to be a leader. Our work supporting the community-led development of climate-ready affordable housing in multiple Lower Mainland communities is but one example.\n\nAs a co-operative, we know that we must stand together against all forms of social and economic exclusion. Everyone must have the same opportunities to succeed. It is unacceptable that people continue to face systemic racism and discrimination, and one of the Board's goals is to become a proactively anti-racist governing body. Doing more to remove systemic barriers is an ongoing Board priority, especially important when those barriers affect people's financial wellbeing.\n\n2021 further reminded everyone why Reconciliation is a core Vancity value. The Board knows true Reconciliation starts with meaningful engagement, listening and respectful collaboration, and Vancity continues to work to deepen and broaden our partnerships and relationships with Indigenous communities. As part of its continuous learning, the Board learned about Indigenous principles of value, wealth and wellbeing from Dr. Dara Kelly in September 2021 and plans further director education on Indigenous topics for 2022.\n\nVancity's climate commitments, announced in 2021, are another top priority for the Board in addressing a systemic challenge that intersects with existing inequalities. That is why the Board set as one of its goals to approve climate risk goals and metrics, and a net-zero emissions transition plan.\n\nBut as a co-operative, we've long known that while the climate crisis will impact us all, those already facing economic and systemic barriers will fare worse. The Board is focused on ensuring our credit union provides help to those among our members and in our communities who might struggle to respond and adapt to the climate crisis on their own. Helping those who might otherwise be left behind is another way co-operatives make a difference.\n\nIn 2021, following an extensive search process, we appointed Christine Bergeron as our permanent President and CEO. Christine has been instrumental in leading our work. She has led our credit union to achieve record results and has done so while navigating a challenging external reality. The Board looks forward to working with Christine and the rest of our leadership group to advance our transformational vision and continue being there for our members and communities when they need us.\n\nSince our founding 75 years ago, Vancity has worked to increase financial opportunity, remove economic barriers, and address systemic challenges affecting our members. This past year, the Board approved a new Vision Statement for Vancity, one that fully captures our hopes and aspirations and will guide our work into the future. Our Vision is: 'A transformed economy that protects the earth and guarantees equity for all.' The challenges we face today may be more complex than they used to be, but our commitment to helping solve them is steadfast. We know that, together with our members, we can bring this vision to life.\n\nAnita Braha Chair, Vancity Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

Yet, I'm proud of how everyone at Vancity responded: staying true to our values and focusing on what matters most - our members, the communities we serve, each other, and the planet that nurtures us all.\n\nMost important was to stand by our members through the turbulence. Our teams continued to serve members' banking needs through the thick and thin of the pandemic. We helped member businesses get through the impact of health restrictions and supply chain delays. We helped members and communities impacted by flooding. We've enhanced account security and how we advise our members and understand their needs.\n\nThis relentless member focus was one key reason that we had very strong financial results this year, especially in terms of loans, investment intakes and overall operating earnings. I take these results both as a sign of the trust our members put in us and as encouragement to further improve member service and experience wherever we can.\n\nBut our work to deliver impact and systemic change for members and communities was equally important in driving our financial results. Throughout our 75 years, Vancity has been committed to addressing systemic challenges and barriers faced by our members and communities. And recent years reinforce why we must continue to be a financial force for change.\n\nWe launched our climate commitments, pledging to bring our financed emissions to net zero by 2040, offer only responsible investment options, and support our members and communities through the transition to a clean and fair economy. We released the first comprehensive\n\naccounting of our financed emissions, giving us a starting point for credible interim targets we'll release in 2022. And we refreshed our slate of climate-focused financial products.\n\nAs part of our journey to become a proactively anti-racist organization, we are implementing recommendations from an external audit we had initiated to look at ways we can advance racial equity for employees, members and communities. To further embed Reconciliation as a core Vancity value, we are deepening our work to better understand and meet the needs of our Indigenous partners and to expand the ways we serve them. And we continue to tailor loans and investments to those underserved, including Black, Indigenous and women entrepreneurs.\n\nOur community investment work continued in full force, funding multiple organizations and initiatives that are removing barriers and driving change in areas ranging from affordable housing to the circular economy and climate equity. We are further focusing this work while also enhancing it as part of the reshaping of our Shared Success program.\n\nWe continue to be recognized for leadership - in our actions, within the credit union system, at all levels of government, and globally - on how to navigate the complexities of achieving sustainable and inclusive growth and building a clean and fair world. Our thought leadership builds on our\n\nco-operative model and decades of experience working to achieve greater financial inclusion and equity. As the world is finally taking notice of a model that we've espoused for many years, we represent a clear, relevant and sought-after voice speaking on behalf of people and planet.\n\nHow we serve members is a big part of what makes us different. And it's our amazing team, who met the year's challenges with determination and so much heart, that sets us apart. That's why we prioritize employees' safety and wellbeing, listen to our people, are purposeful in our actions and inclusive in our approach - and why I was so proud that we saw high employee engagement results and were ranked as the top local employer.\n\nNot every year will see such terrific outcomes, and certainly I expect ups and downs in 2022 given the uncertainty facing the economy. But our member focus and impact work, our employees' patience and compassion, and our commitment to staying true to our values and pursuing our vision, remain constant and will continue to propel us forward.\n\nI am inspired by our organization, the work we did, and our successes achieved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristine Bergeron President and CEO",

        "page_content": "## Operating context and strategic priorities.\n\nIt has been over two years since the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. Navigating the pandemic has forced our members, our communities and everyone at Vancity to face unprecedented challenges, find new ways of working, and support our friends, family and coworkers as they confront the physical and mental health challenges of a lengthy pandemic.\n\nAs we were planning for 2021, the effects of the pandemic were creating enormous uncertainty. It was unclear whether sufficient government support could be maintained until public health measures could stop, or at least contain, the spread of the virus. At Vancity, the pandemic was impacting nearly every aspect of our operations and financials. Our actions to support our members, ready our organization, and strengthen our financial position were swift and effective. However, they only served to partially address the challenges that we were facing.\n\nOur plans called for 2021 to be a year of transition as we recovered from, and adapted to, the effects of the pandemic and put Vancity on a trajectory towards achieving our strategic goals.\n\nAt the end of 2021, our world looked very different. BC's economic recovery was stronger than we expected as the unemployment rate fell below pre-pandemic levels, business and consumer confidence strengthened, and consumer spending rose. However, new variants forced us to continuously adapt the way we live, work and play. And we face new challenges and uncertainties in the form of rising inflation and rising geopolitical tensions.\n\nThrough all of this uncertainty and change, Vancity and our members have shown their strength and resiliency. Our organization is also stronger than ever, with a more engaged workforce, a structure that is more aligned to our strategy, and improved technology, processes and capabilities.\n\nLooking ahead, our strategy hasn't changed. Vancity is committed to being a financial force for change as we use the tools of finance to address members' needs and to advance the wellbeing of our members and the communities where they live and work. Our goals also remain the same:\n\n- \u00b7  Delivering what our members need, when and where they need it, to become the financial institution our members love to bank with and their best financial partner\n- \u00b7  Driving meaningful social and systemic change to build a clean and fair world and demonstrate that a financial institution can be an agent of positive change\n- \u00b7  Creating an internal culture that values purpose and performance through a diversity, equity and inclusion lens to become the organization people love to work at and a leading employer\n- \u00b7  Delivering strong, stable financial performance to support investments in our future and to ensure our credit union remains financially strong so we can make a greater impact in our communities\n\nFor more on our financial plan, see\n\npage 24\n\n.\n\n## Our climate commitments.\n\nWe must work towards a climate transition that puts people at its centre and leaves no one behind.\n\nNet zero by 2040: Our ambition is to make Vancity net zero by 2040 across all our mortgages and loans. That means the carbon emitted from anything we finance will be eliminated or significantly reduced, with any remaining emissions being brought to net zero. We'll start this work by setting our first target for 2025.\n\nFinancing an equitable climate transition: Unaddressed, climate change will change how we work and live, and will drive further inequality. We will focus our work in financial and social inclusion to provide banking and other solutions to help people who are affected by the climate emergency, as well as those seeking support in transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable living.\n\nInvesting in a better future: We will help our members invest for the future we need by offering only responsible investment options that can demonstrate\n\nthe integrity of their Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) screening and stewardship process.\n\nBe transparent and accountable: We will encourage change within the financial services sector by accurately measuring and openly reporting on how our own actions are improving the wellbeing of people, communities and the environment. We aim to continue implementing, testing and helping improve emerging international standards for climate and impact reporting.\n\nWalk the talk in all we do: We will live our values in our daily decision-making in order to serve the diverse needs of our members, staff, and communities. We will do our part across our operations to contribute to a just climate transition.\n\nFor more details, see Climate commitments",

Members who are very satisfied with our overall service delivery decreased to 50 per cent, not meeting our 2021 target, although our average score out of 10 was still quite high at 8.1.\n\n## Satisfaction with overall service delivery (9s and 10s out of 10)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|    |     | 2022 TARGET 54%   |\n|----|-----|-------------------|\n| 21 | 50% | 50%               |\n| 20 |     |                   |\n| 19 |     |                   |\n| 18 |     |                   |\n| 17 |     |                   |\n\n50%\n\nThis decrease can be attributed to several factors. As members are doing more of their banking with us digitally or by phone, rather than in branches, our digital channels have seen a significant increase in volume. This posed challenges in having enough employees available to respond in a timely manner in a year with a record high number of interactions with us via our call centre. The introduction of new features, such as multi-factor authentication and self-serve password reset, also influenced member satisfaction in 2021.\n\nTo provide additional ways to allow our members to avoid in-person transactions due to COVID-19, we continued to provide a dedicated phone line for members who are 65+ years old or have a disability, to better assist them with their specific needs.\n\nOur branch network also saw changes to provide greater community location coverage with the opening of the Wesbrook Village Community Branch at UBC, while closing the Oakridge Community Branch. In addition, we plan to open a new branch in North Vancouver on Lonsdale Avenue in 2022, as we continue to monitor our members' changing needs while working to expand our physical presence in new communities.",

Since then, we've continued to serve all the evolving financial needs of our members, while using financial tools and community partnerships to address the systemic challenges they face and advance the wellbeing of their communities.\n\nIn response to changing payment needs of our business owners, we launched the enviro\u2122 Visa* Business Card , a no-fee card designed to support small businesses and not-for-profit organizations, especially with their growth. We also introduced Interac e-Transfer \u00ae for Business, and updated our business lending system, enabling online self-service capabilities for business members.\n\nIn 2021, we made numerous upgrades to the technology that enables us to serve our members. In 2022, we plan to continue to invest in this work, including further improvements to our online banking platform.\n\nOpen banking (often called consumer-directed finance) provides a way to exchange data that would allow members to share their financial information safely with third parties. While it's still not clear how or when open banking will be implemented in Canada, we are focused on modernizing our payments infrastructure and implementing new capabilities like Interac e-Transfer for Business that are built upon the new data exchange standards. We are working to ensure that we will have the technological foundation to enable our participation.\n\n## Membership growth\n\nAs Vancity grows, our influence on financial inclusion, environmental sustainability and the economic resilience of our communities grows too.\n\nIn 2021, Vancity's membership grew by 9,662, or 1.75 per cent. This rate was twice that of the rest of the BC credit union system, and above our target of 1.20 per cent, which we set at 1.5 times the projected general BC population growth.\n\n## Number of members\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET 557,206   | 2022 TARGET 569,505   | 2024 PROJECTION 574,896   |\n|----|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| 21 | 560,261               |                       |                           |\n| 20 | 550,599               |                       |                           |\n| 19 | 543,621               |                       |                           |\n| 18 | 533,936 1             |                       |                           |\n| 17 | 1                     |                       |                           |\n\n525,506\n\n- 1  Due to a change in methodology, data as of 2018 is not comparable.\n- * Trademark of Visa Int., used under licence.\n\n## Percentage increase in membership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET 1.20%   | 2022 TARGET 1.65%   | 2024 PROJECTION 1.95%   |\n|----|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| 21 | 1.75%               |                     |                         |\n| 20 | 1.28%               |                     |                         |\n| 19 | 1.81%               |                     |                         |\n| 18 | n/a                 |                     |                         |\n| 17 |                     |                     |                         |\n\nn/a",

As we all do more of our banking online, Vancity has been working to ensure we offer the digital services members want while having a stable and secure technology platform that helps protect member privacy.\n\nWe want to make our community branches as safe and convenient as possible. COVID-19 and climate-related weather events such as wildfires have enhanced our focus on filtration, ventilation, and monitoring overall indoor air quality. In 2021, we switched from annual to continuous real-time monitoring of indoor air quality at branch locations and continued deep cleaning practices.\n\n## Better online security for all members.\n\nWhen we asked members what digital features they most wanted, self-serve password reset was the most requested, followed by Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\nIn late 2021, we rolled out MFA, an additional layer of security that helps to protect members' accounts from fraud. When members enter their MEMBER CARD \u00ae number and password, they may be asked to enter an additional one-time code which will be sent via a text message, an automated voice call, or an authentication app.\n\nThe introduction of MFA helped reduce online banking-related fraud. It also made it possible to offer members self-serve password reset.\n\nHowever, the launch was challenging for some members who had difficulty setting up MFA. We worked to support all members through the transition and were able to resolve access issues.\n\nWe reviewed the rollout of MFA and listened to members and employees to learn how we can improve the member experience in future security upgrades.",

This commits us to identify metrics and set targets by 2023 that make a substantial contribution to the financial health and inclusion of our communities. While we've demonstrated leadership in financial inclusion and access for 75 years, signing on to this commitment will help us better track our outcomes relative to our peers and set targets to support our journey to achieving a just transition. This new financial inclusion commitment aligns directly with our second climate commitment, Financing an\n\nequitable climate transition\n\n.\n\nAccess to capital has long been a barrier to growth for entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds. Through the Black Entrepreneurship Program , launched in 2021,\n\nwe offer term loans and operating loans to Black entrepreneurs and Black-led organizations. We also provided the Black Business Association of BC support to develop a 12-month business program that provides entrepreneurs help with loan applications, sustainability practices and strategic growth planning support.\n\nWe also revised the\n\nUnity Women's Entrepreneurship\n\nProgram in 2021 to improve accessibility in response to feedback from members.\n\nRefugees and newcomers to Canada often experience difficulties in accessing basic banking services. Since 2016, we've had an on-site banking kiosk at the Immigrant Services Society of BC's (ISSofBC) Welcome Centre in Vancouver. This is a one-stop support centre offering services such as opening bank accounts on arrival for newcomers and refugees coming to Canada.\n\nIn 2021, Vancity welcomed the first of five refugee families from diverse backgrounds we committed to sponsoring through ISSofBC's family reunification program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVANCITY FIRSTS\n\nIn 2014, we became one of the first mainstream financial institutions to launch an alternative to typical payday loans.

We also focused on offering self-led financial literacy modules online , making financial education more accessible to the community and members. Topics include basic banking, investments, and retirement and estate planning.\n\nFor many years, Vancity led the national Each One, Teach One financial literacy program, training credit union employees across the country to become certified volunteer trainers in the community, in partnership with the Canadian Credit Union Association (CCUA). In 2021, we fully transitioned the program to the CCUA, creating a centralized coordination hub of information and resources.\n\nWe created the Wealth Mindset - Indigenous Financial Resilience program in collaboration with Indigenous Elders, to meet the needs and strengths of Indigenous learners and communities. We started training some employees as facilitators and will roll out the program to communities in 2022.\n\nOur commitment to the creation of more affordable housing units and to supporting new builds and retrofits that reduce emissions from the built environment could result in increased demand for timber. We are working with nonprofit builder partners to test ways to reduce the environmental impacts of these processes. We are also encouraging members taking out loans or mortgages that entail retrofits to consider 'deconstruction,' a process that maximizes the resources, including timber, that can be salvaged for reuse as part of a retrofit.\n\nIn 2021, 3,150 units of affordable housing were constructed or renovated with financing from Vancity.\n\n## Affordable housing\n\nLack of access to affordable housing is severely affecting people's quality of life and the health of our communities. For many years, Vancity has worked with organizations that help people living along the housing continuum: from emergency shelters through to transitional and subsidized housing, co-operatives, below-market rentals and property ownership.\n\nThe Vancity Affordable Housing Accelerator Fund plays a key role in this strategy by providing low-cost and flexible loans to support capital needs in the pre-development phase of affordable housing development projects. Since 2011, the Fund has supported the development of 4,450 affordable rental homes by providing 75 loans for 59 unique housing projects developed by 31 non-profit housing organizations.\n\n## Number of affordable housing units constructed or renovated with funding from Vancity 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2,907\n\n- 1  Includes acquisitions and renovations of homes that already existed, as well as net new homes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVANCITY FIRSTS\n\nVancity blazed a trail by providing mortgages to women without a male co-signer. In the early 1960s, even if a woman had an income, banks deemed it too risky to provide women loans, because they assumed women would leave work to have children.",

As one of our key goals, we're committed to being an anti-racist organization.\n\nIn 2021, we received the results of our external racial equity audit. With Vancity's Racial Equity Employee Resource Group (ERG) review, validation and input into these findings, we began implementing some of these recommendations. We:\n\n- \u00b7  Implemented recommendations to improve accessibility in hiring through transparency, inclusive language and processes\n- \u00b7  Engaged with additional community partners to help us attract diverse employees\n- \u00b7  Improved our systems to gather insights on employee diversity while protecting employee privacy\n- \u00b7  Updated and added new training on topics such as anti-racism, active bystanders, neurodiversity, and psychological safety\n- \u00b7  Hosted employee divisional townhalls and micro learning sessions, and provided resources to employees via an anti-racism resource centre to further internal learnings\n- \u00b7  Expanded the Indigenous talent program and began training leaders on Reconciliation\n- \u00b7  Hired a Chief Equity and People Officer to lead our human resources function, as well as two new permanent roles in the diversity, equity and inclusion team\n- \u00b7  Began a review of our granting processes and practices to uncover bias and improve access\n- \u00b7  Engaged with our Employee Resource Groups to ensure our efforts are informed and assessed by people with lived experience of discrimination\n\n## Unbinding gender binaries.\n\nFor the past several years we've been keenly aware that our binary malefemale gender data didn't reflect the varied identities of our employees. In 2021, we ensured employees had choice and ownership over their gender options in our data.\n\nFollowing consultation with people with lived experience in discrimination and industry experts, we changed our diversity survey significantly. To create a more inclusive and accurate survey, nearly 50 options and free text spaces were added to reflect a more diverse range of gender, racial identity, abilities and disabilities, and sexual orientation.\n\nAccurate gender and other diversity data helps us better reflect the communities we serve in our employee composition, see our employee population for what it truly is, better meet employee needs, and ensure equitable employment opportunities and benefits.\n\nDisclosing one's diversity is a choice. This means that we will have incomplete data. An employee can choose not to answer a specific question, or choose not to participate at all. We asked all employees to complete the myDiversity survey and 69 per cent participated.\n\nRepresentation of diversity among employees is one of many indicators that tell us we're on the right track to creating an actively anti-racist organization. We continue to encourage our employees to complete the myDiversity survey and help us build an accurate picture of our progress in representation of diversity at Vancity.",

        "page_content": "## Planet: The climate crisis.\n\nIn 2021, British Columbians experienced three high-profile and devastating climate change-related catastrophes in less than six months: a heat dome, wildfires, and unprecedented flooding from an atmospheric river. These events highlighted the inadequacies of infrastructure and buildings to meet the changing conditions, the insecurity of supply chains and food systems, and the disproportional impacts on vulnerable groups and communities including low-income residents, the elderly, and remote or Indigenous communities.\n\nThey also highlighted the need to think long term and act quickly to find solutions to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions while adapting to keep our ecosystems and communities healthy and safe. This requires deep (some would say radical) collaboration across key players such as governments, regulators, experts, industry groups, businesses, residents and consumers - and for each one of us to play a role.\n\nWe believe financial institutions, including Vancity, can and should play a critical role in enabling the transition to a clean, resilient and fair economy. The climate crisis is a global issue with significant implications for the financial sector, our own operations and business model, and for the people and local communities we serve. It requires shifting how we all do business.\n\n## Financed greenhouse gas emissions\n\nVancity's most significant climate-related impacts are as a result of the loans and investments we choose to make. In 2019, we publicly committed to tracking and disclosing financed emissions using the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Global GHG\n\nAccounting and Reporting Standard\n\n.\n\nWe reported our financed emissions publicly for the first time in our 2020 Annual Report. Currently, we report emissions for around 82 per cent of all lending, 53 per cent of treasury investments and 63 per cent of managed client investments in terms of the dollars loaned or invested. Our coverage is generally higher than our Canadian peers. We report financed emissions separately from the rest of our scope 3 emissions for now.\n\nWe are a signatory to both the UN Principles for Responsible Banking's Collective Commitment to\n\nClimate Action\n\n(CCCA) and the UN-convened\n\nNet-Zero\n\nBanking Alliance (NZBA). We were the first Canadian financial institution to join the NZBA in early 2021, which at the time of writing had grown to include eight Canadian members. The NZBA has the most ambitious commitments of all banking climate initiatives. In January 2022, it welcomed the 100th signatory to its net-zero emissions by 2050 commitment, representing over 40 per cent of global banking assets.\n\n## What we're doing to address the climate crisis.\n\nWe want to lead and advocate for changes that are needed across the financial services sector, and in early 2021 we announced five ambitious Climate Commitments , including financing an equitable climate transition and achieving net zero across our lending portfolio by 2040.\n\nAchieving net zero means eliminating or significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from anything we finance, with any remaining emissions being balanced by removing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the air. Our ambition outpaces by ten years the global targets called for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which notes that global net human-caused emissions of CO 2 need to fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach 'net zero' around 2050.\n\nWe've committed to measure and openly report our financed emissions in addition to our operational emissions - Vancity has been carbon neutral in our operations since 2008 - and to continue to implement and advance global standards for climate and impact accounting and target setting. We've further committed to set near-term targets for climate and financial health and inclusion, and to demonstrate how our actions are contributing to the wellbeing of people, communities and the environment.\n\nWe will ground our work in financial and social inclusion, providing banking and other solutions to help people who are affected by the climate crisis, as well as those seeking support in transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable living.\n\nWe also recognize the importance of developing, adopting and employing climate risk management practices, building on the foundation of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

        "page_content": "We consider the financed emissions data presented in the table to be highly estimated due to limitations in data availability. The data quality score averages 4.2 for loans, excluding project finance, which PCAF defines as proxy data (data quality 4) or estimated data with very little support (data quality 5). As an example, guided by the PCAF standard we calculate emissions related to residential or commercial mortgages based on the type and location of the building. Where feasible, we use the floor area to improve our estimates and increase our data quality score from a 5 to a 4. The data quality score is approximate for project finance, treasury investments and managed client investments for various reasons, including the fact that we source some of the data from third-party data providers.\n\nWe hired external consultants to assess methodology, data integrity, and reporting of our 2021 financed emissions.\n\nIn 2021, as well as improving data quality, we expanded our financed emissions disclosures to include project finance and some of our liquidity investments where data and methodologies exist. As we continue to improve data quality and coverage, we expect further changes to our methodology which may result in recalculations of historical data. To provide the percentage change in emissions since 2020, we updated our financed emissions totals for 2020 so they are comparable with 2021.\n\n## Please refer to the\n\nFinanced emissions approach and methodology\n\nfor more detail, including updated 2020 data.\n\n## Operational and financed emissions Operational and financed emissions\n\n(tonnes CO 2 e) (tonnes CO 2 e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data insights\n\nOur financed emissions data, despite being highly estimated, provides valuable insights into the size and concentration of emissions within our lending and investment portfolios. While many financial institutions must contend with emissions attributed to fossil fuel investments, we don't lend or directly invest in that sector. Most of our lending-related emissions can be attributed to natural gas use from the buildings and homes we finance, and specifically the natural gas used by the owners and/or occupants of these buildings. Our business loans support small- and mediumsized enterprises. In 2021, the top emitters by total emissions in our portfolio were associated with manufacturing and construction, in particular, emissions related to the construction and renovation of buildings. Our financed emissions data is also helpful to understand climate transition-related risks and opportunities, and we've begun the process to quantify transition risk in our portfolios.\n\nIn general, our lending and investment portfolios grew over the past year. Overall, absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by around three per cent for project finance, mortgages and loans combined, and increased by around eight per cent for managed client investments in liquid equity. Of note is that absolute emissions related to business loans decreased by 15 per cent despite moderate loan growth. This was due in part to a relatively large loan provided to a manufacturing company being paid off, decreasing emissions significantly. Similarly, emissions related to managed client investments in Inhance SRI (responsible investment) mutual funds grew by just nine per cent compared to portfolio growth of 60 per cent. The likely explanation is material fluctuations in the market value of investee companies, which can affect how much emissions are attributed to Vancity, as well as actual or estimated investee emissions.\n\nWe have several strategies to help manage and reduce our emissions, which we will review and adjust based on the nearterm climate targets we set in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VANCITY FIRSTS\n\nVancity was the first financial institution in Canada to contribute Visa profits to community groups working on environmental initiatives when we established the Vancity enviroFund\u2122 program in 1990. We still contribute five per cent of Vancity enviro Visa card profits to the program each year.\n\nIn 2021, we established a specific policy to guide lending to energy-related projects and support the transition to a low-carbon economy. The policy confirms our focus on financing clean energy projects and reinforces our practice of not lending to companies that extract, produce and/or distribute fossil fuels, biogases or nuclear energy. In 2022, we plan to refine our investment approach to energy to ensure we continue to be well positioned to support the low-carbon transition. Because this is a rapidly evolving area, we will review these policies semi-annually with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nIn addition to financed emissions, we track avoided emissions from clean energy projects. In 2021, these resulted in approximately 4,300 tonnes of avoided emissions, the majority from geothermal, solar and wind technologies. This is equivalent to driving 19 million miles, or one year's trash from 4,300 households, according to\n\nCitizens for Public Justice\n\n.\n\nPlease read more on our clean energy financing at\n\nvancity.com/VCIBCleanEnergy",

See our and inventory report for more details.\n\nOverall operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased again in 2021, primarily due to the pandemic. As many employees continued to work from home and restrictions on non-essential travel were issued, there were reductions in energy use, paper use, employee commuting and business travel.\n\nTo further reduce emissions, we plan to move all of our operations away from carbon-based heating and have an all-electric vehicle fleet.\n\nGHG handbook\n\nCarbon neutral in our own operations since 2008, in 2021 we purchased offsets from Offsetters for $63,910 to offset our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations. As part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, we are committed to reaching net-zero emissions for both financed and operational emissions.

We also launched Vancity's Planet-Wise Business\n\nGuide for Climate Action\n\n.\n\n## Advocacy\n\nVancity meets and consults regularly with officials and policymakers at every level of government to advance our commitment to building a cleaner and fairer world, as well as in service of our business and regulatory needs. Our climate commitments, in particular, are highly dependent on enabling government policy and regulations, and in 2021 we formed strategic partnerships and networks to serve those goals and drive systemic change. We've also begun building coalitions of stakeholders who share our goals, and working with community partners to inform research and initiatives that serve to illuminate and elevate the profile of our advocacy priorities.\n\nKey appointments:\n\n- \u00b7  Our CEO was appointed to the federal Sustainable Finance Action Council , to support the growth of a well-functioning, sustainable finance system\n- \u00b7  She also joined a new extension of BC's economic forecast council, the Economic Wellbeing and Sustainability Roundtable\n- \u00b7  Our Chief Technology and Information Officer was appointed to the federal government's Task Force on Women and the Economy , advising on strategies to advance gender equity and address systemic barriers\n- \u00b7  We continued to lead the Canadian Credit Union Association's Climate Change Working Group\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions through retrofits.\n\nThere are many ways we are working with community organizations to promote building retrofits to lower emissions. This is our approach and some activities we have invested in.\n\nBetter understanding barriers to retrofitting: OPEN Regenerative Technologies conducted research to help identify and address barriers to retrofits.\n\nHelping homeowners choose their best options: City Green conducts virtual home energy check-ups, one-on-one coaching, and public education on heat pumps and home retrofits.\n\nEnsuring equity in retrofits access: Vancity's early support to Ecotrust Canada enabled the installation of 154 heat pumps in Bella Bella (with additional installations planned in 2022-2023 across both Heiltsuk and 'Namgis territory).\n\nBuilding a network of qualified contractors rooted in a just transition: The Electrical Joint Training Committee supports solar-capture infrastructure training. WesternJets' Training Centre provides career access to youth, women, newcomer and Indigenous apprentices to develop skills required to maintain a green energy structure. And the Home Performance Stakeholder Council is focused on building a network of qualified contractors and readying the workforce to improve performance and reduce GHG emissions in single family homes.",

A record-low interest rate environment also drove many members to refinance their mortgages in 2021 to lock in a lower cost of borrowing. The resulting prepayment penalty fee income from this activity provided a one-time boost to our 2021 earnings. And the reduction and stabilization of the credit risk environment in 2021 reduced our expected credit losses. Behind the scenes, we made targeted investments in our people, technology and facilities, and closely managed expenses.\n\nAll of these factors led to an overall strengthening of our financial foundation as we finished 2021 with income before distribution and tax of $176.4 million, compared to $65.3 million in 2020. With 30 per cent of our net income each year going to members and communities, these positive financial results have led to the largest Shared Success payout in our history.\n\n## Operating earnings (millions)\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET $115.1   | 2022 TARGET $126.9   | 2024 PROJECTION $153.1   |\n|----|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| 21 |                      |                      |                          |\n| 20 |                      |                      |                          |\n| 19 |                      |                      |                          |\n| 18 |                      |                      |                          |\n| 17 |                      |                      |                          |\n\n$155.0\n\n## Net lending growth (millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET $1,083 2   | 2022 TARGET $1,225   |\n|----|------------------------|----------------------|\n| 21 |                        |                      |\n| 20 |                        |                      |\n| 19 |                        |                      |\n| 18 |                        |                      |\n| 17 |                        |                      |\n\n$697\n\n- 2  In Q3, we updated the target from $1,048M as disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## VANCITY FIRSTS\n\nIn 2011, Vancity became the largest organization in Canada to adopt the Living Wage policy recognizing the social and economic benefits of paying employees and service providers a wage that meets their basic living needs.\n\n## Return on average members' equity (ROME) - business results\n\n|    |      | 2021 TARGET 5.4%   | 2022 TARGET 6.2%   | 2024 PROJECTION 6.6%   |\n|----|------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| 21 | 9.3% |                    |                    |                        |\n| 20 | 4.3% |                    |                    |                        |\n| 19 | 5.6% |                    |                    |                        |\n| 18 | 7.9% |                    |                    |                        |\n| 17 |      |                    |                    |                        |\n\n9.3%\n\n## Return on average members' equity (ROME) - after Shared Success\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET 4.0%   | 2022 TARGET 4.7%   | 2024 PROJECTION 5.0%   |\n|----|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|\n| 21 |                    |                    |                        |\n| 20 |                    |                    |                        |\n| 19 |                    |                    |                        |\n| 18 |                    |                    |                        |\n| 17 |                    |                    |                        |\n\n7.6%\n\n## Net SWM inflows (millions) 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2021 TARGET $238   | 2022 TARGET $695   | 2024 PROJECTION $803   |    |\n|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|----|\n| 21 $462            |                    |                        |    |\n| 20 $59             |                    |                        |    |\n| 19 $(15)           |                    |                        |    |\n| 18 $(50)           |                    |                        |    |\n| 17                 |                    |                        |    |\n\n$74\n\n- 1  Desjardins Financial Services (DFS) inflows of $43M are included in net SWM inflows; however, DFS assets under management are excluded from reported total assets under administration/ management as the service is administered by DFS and not through Vancity advisors.",

        "page_content": "As we look to 2022 and beyond, we see a need to manage an ever-shifting set of economic and geopolitical conditions. We see an increasingly choppy global economic recovery and a Canadian economy grappling with widespread demand-supply mismatches, mounting inflation concerns, and the continued emergence of new COVID-19 variants.\n\nIf these conditions persist, 2022 and beyond may be more challenging for us as higher interest rates and inflation pressures reduce consumer purchasing power, trigger greater market volatility and limit economic growth.\n\nWe will also face pressures resulting from activity we experienced in 2021. Record refinancing of loans and mortgages in 2021 will drive further compression of our margins and put pressure on revenue growth. At the same time, we are accelerating our investment in our technology foundation to provide a strong, stable and safe platform for our members and continue to evolve our services and products. Our 2022 financial plan calls for some moderation in our profitability, with strengthening results through to 2024 and beyond.\n\nTo calculate how much profit we generate with every dollar of members' equity, we use a measurement called ROME, or return on average members' equity. This measurement shows the returns or business results that Vancity generates after taxes and Shared Success distributions. In 2021, ROME was 7.0 per cent, against a target of 4.0 per cent.\n\n## Assets and liabilities (balance sheet)\n\nIn 2021, Vancity's total assets and assets under administration grew to $33.2 billion from $30.5 billion. At the end of the year, our total assets were $26.6 billion and our assets under administration were $6.6 billion. This represents growth of 6.8 and 17.9 per cent, respectively, over the previous year. Our balance sheet reflects the continued economic strength of our communities with 89.4 per cent of our loans funded by deposits from our members.\n\n| Residential mortgages                                                    | $  14,686   | $  12,684   | $  2,002   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------|\n| Consumer (personal) loans                                                | 596         | 588         | 8          |\n| Commercial mortgages and  loans (loans to businesses  and organizations) | 7,495       | 6,742       | 753        |\n|                                                                          | 22,777      | 20,014      | 2,763      |\n| Accrued interest receivable                                              | 28          | 45          | (17)       |\n| Allowance for credit losses                                              | (84)        | (119)       | 35         |\n| Total loans and advances  to members                                     | $  22,721   | $  19,940   | $  2,781   |\n| Member deposits                                                          | $  20,490   | $  19,234   | $  1,256   |\n| Agent and wholesale  deposits                                            | 2,168       | 2,239       | (71)       |\n| Shares                                                                   | 140         | 143         | (3)        |\n| Accrued interest and  dividends payable                                  | 94          | 129         | (35)       |\n| Total deposits                                                           | $  22,892   | $  21,745   | $  1,147   |\n\n## Triple bottom line assets and assets under administration (TBLAA)\n\nVancity uses our assets to improve social inclusion, economic wellbeing and environmental sustainability. The Global Alliance for Banking on Values defines TBLAA as assets that contribute to at least one dimension of social/cultural, economic or environmental wellbeing (see the glossary for more information).\n\nIn 2021, our TBLAA assets grew to $10.7 billion from $8.9 billion in 2020, ahead of target. Nearly one-third (32.3 per cent) of all our assets and assets under administration are now invested in the triple bottom line, up from 29.2 per cent in 2020. This increase reflects the composition of the growth of our lending and Sustainable Wealth Management portfolios. Almost 70 per cent of our growth of total assets and assets under administration in 2021 were TBLAA.\n\n## Triple bottom line assets and assets under administration (billions)\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET $9.1   | 2022 TARGET $11.7   | 2024 PROJECTION $14.6   |\n|----|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| 21 |                    |                     |                         |\n| 20 |                    |                     |                         |\n| 19 |                    |                     |                         |\n| 18 |                    |                     |                         |\n| 17 |                    |                     |                         |\n\n$6.1\n\n## Total assets and assets under administration (billions)\n\n|    | 2021 TARGET $29.0   | 2022 TARGET $35.1   |\n|----|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 21 |                     |                     |\n| 20 |                     |                     |\n| 19 |                     |                     |\n| 18 |                     |                     |\n| 17 |                     |                     |\n\n$26.4",

The 2021 calculation no longer includes distribution to community.\n\n## Paying a living wage\n\nIn 2021, Vancity recertified as a Living Wage Employer. The living wage in 2021 was a minimum of $20.52 per hour in Metro Vancouver. We continue to make living wage adjustments in what we pay our own employees as well as working closely with key suppliers to have their employees providing direct services to Vancity paid a living wage. When the living wage rate decreases, we continue to pay the previous, higher rate (in 2021 we continued to pay the 2018 rate of $20.91).\n\n## Liquidity and capital\n\nVancity's liquidity ratio is expressed as a percentage of treasury assets - liquid investments that can be quickly and economically converted into cash - against total deposits and debt liabilities (borrowings). Our liquidity fell to 13.6 per cent in 2021, down from 16.9 per cent in 2020, reflecting a reduction in the additional liquidity that we were holding in the face of the highly uncertain environment in 2020.\n\nOur capital adequacy ratio was 14.2 per cent in 2021, safely above our internal minimum and the minimum capital required by our regulator. A strong capital ratio demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet and provides us with the capacity to support future growth\n\n| Liquidity ratio        | 13.6%   | 16.9%   | 13.1%   | 13.4%   | 12.9%   |\n|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Capital adequacy ratio | 14.2%   | 14.7%   | 14.7%   | 14.8%   | 14.1%   |\n\nVANCITY STORIES\n\n## Creating the circular economy.\n\nThe Project Zero incubator program helps entrepreneurs with new business ideas or early startups turn waste into a resource rather than a liability.\n\nREAD THE FULL STORY HERE",

The EPBR provides a framework under which we make decisions that seek to increase positive impact, or reduce harm, for people and planet.\n\nIn 2021, we sourced 63 per cent of the value of our purchases from locally based businesses - about $80 million.\n\nLocal businesses were severely impacted by the economic fallout of the pandemic and lockdowns. We heard from thousands of our business members that they need people to shop locally, and to support a fair economic recovery. We responded in part with the 'Load-up on local' campaign, when Vancity enviro TM Visa cardholders earned additional reward points from local businesses. We also partnered with Support Local BC and Daily Hive on initiatives meant to encourage local spending.\n\nIn 2021, we invested $8.7 million back into community through\n\n- grants to 452 not-for-profit organizations and businesses. The vast majority (62 per cent) of our grants support strategic, larger scale initiatives through our Systems Transformation Grants. However, small grants, like those made through our Community Partnership\n\nProgram and Community Branch Partnerships , play an important role in helping build new relationships with non-profit organizations we haven't worked with before. About one in 20 of these grant recipients end up being our partners in larger scale community projects and/or become Vancity loan recipients.\n\n## See page 24 of the accountability statements for more information on our Profit metrics.\n\n| Allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans                                  | %   |   0.4 |   0.6 |   0.4 |   0.4 |   0.4 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Return on average assets                                                                    | %   |   0.4 |   0.2 |   0.3 |   0.4 |   0.4 |\n| Net interest margin (net interest income as a per cent of average interest  earning assets) | %   |   1.9 |   1.9 |   1.9 |   2   |   2   |\n| Net interest income as a percentage of operating revenue                                    | %   |  81.8 |  82.4 |  82.1 |  83.5 |  77.1 |\n| Percentage of member loans funded by member deposits                                        | %   |  89.4 |  95.4 |  85.6 |  84.4 |  85.7 |\n| Spending through locally based suppliers                                                    | %   |  63   |  63   |  65   |  64   |  68   |\n| Community grants approved (millions)                                                        | $   |   8.7 |   4.6 |  10.4 |  12.4 |   7.9 |\n\nWe know that small businesses and not-for-profits are vital to creating fair, equitable and vibrant communities. That's why in 2021 we allocated 13 per cent of our Shared Success community funds to support small business and not-for-profit members continuing to grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vancity supported 99 small businesses with a total of $462,500 in COVID-19 recovery grants. Employees helped identify businesses impacted by the pandemic and in need. For example, a $5,000 grant meant one business member could finally pay her employees, who had offered to put their salaries on hold in order to keep the business open. Vancity also provided grants totalling $505,000 to 36 not-for-profits affected by COVID-19. Most were in hard-hit sectors, such as support and recovery services or arts and culture organizations.",

Deeply embedding Reconciliation as one of Vancity's core values continued to be a focus. In 2021:\n\nWe provided employees with resources to learn from and reflect on, recommitting to understanding the truth of our shared history. More than 1,200 employees participated in an employee townhall meeting with the Honourable Steven Point, (member of the Skowkale Nation and BC's 28th Lieutenant Governor), to deepen our understanding of Reconciliation. Member-\n\nfacing managers were trained on working effectively with Indigenous people.\n\nWe established a cross-functional leadership group to work through operational barriers in serving Indigenous people and First Nations, and to guide the development of an integrated Indigenous Banking Strategy for Vancity.\n\nWe changed requirements so that our services are more inclusive to the Indigenous people who may not have readily available IDs.\n\nWe signed on to the Progressive Aboriginal Relations (PAR) certification program run by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business to help identify the most impactful opportunities and to hold ourselves accountable to that recognized framework. It will provide an independent, third-party verification process of Vancity reports on leadership actions, employment, business development and community relationships. The PAR program will help ensure our new Indigenous Banking Strategy is rooted in community through access to Indigenous resources and networks.\n\nWith the support of Elders and community members, we indigenized and decolonized the Each One, Teach One financial literacy curriculum and centred it on an Indigenous definition of wealth and learning.\n\nWe invested over $1.3 million of our Shared Success community funds in initiatives designed to strengthen Indigenous communities by:\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing the development of on- and off-reserve housing\n- \u00b7 Increasing access to financial tools and advice for Indigenous entrepreneurs\n- \u00b7 Increasing stable and supportive employment for Indigenous people\n- \u00b7 Developing formalized relationships with First Nations and Indigenous communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VANCITY FIRSTS\n\nIn 1959, Leonard Lane and other members of the BC Association for the Advancement of Coloured People saw a need in their community, much like Vancity's founders did in 1946, and took action. They opened BC's only Blackowned and run financial institution - the BC Unity Credit Union - and focused on financial literacy and equitable loan access for Vancouver's Black Strathcona community. Since merging with Vancity in 1971, the BCUCU's legacy lives on through us.\n\nThis resource is taken from Black Strathcona and is copyright Creative Cultural Collaborations Society 2013, reproduced with permission.",

Board members are responsible for ensuring good governance at Vancity. They act as stewards of our organization, provide critical oversight and help ensure that members' money is invested in ways that improve our communities.\n\nThe Board delegates the day-to-day management of Vancity to the President and Chief Executive Officer, who establishes the accountabilities of each member of the executive leadership team. Each Director serves on three or more committees and may be appointed to the Boards of our subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\nMembers of Vancity's Board of Directors are regularly in touch with our members and are active in the communities where they live and work. They represent the credit union at public events, meet with other credit unions, and in some cases hold positions on other boards.\n\nFor more on the Board, including attendance records, professional development, remuneration, and the Board diversity statement, see Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Board of Directors' election\n\nOne of the seven co-operative principles is 'democratic member control.' One way Vancity members have a say in the future direction of our credit union is by electing Directors annually for a term that normally runs three years, up to a maximum of four consecutive terms.\n\nThe Board considers regulatory expectations and feedback from members to establish a transparent election process. The Nominations and Election Committee works hard to attract a diverse range of candidates, including those with experience to oversee more than $33 billion in assets and assets under administration.\n\nFor the 2021 election, the Committee included two Directors and four members-at-large and recommended five of twelve Board candidates. Members could vote for their choice of up to four candidates. The top three candidates were elected for three-year terms. The candidate who placed fourth was elected for a one-year period to fill a vacancy left by a Board member who resigned before the end of their term.\n\nA total of 33,303 members voted (6.7 per cent of eligible members).\n\n## Risk management\n\nVancity's risk management framework enables the Board to define and approve an appropriate risk appetite, which outlines how much risk Vancity is willing to take in order to successfully achieve its strategic plan. We knowingly and willingly take on risk because we see the upside and use effective risk management techniques to provide an appropriate safety net.\n\nIn 2021, the areas of risk we focused most attention on included:\n\n- \u00b7  Climate: meeting net-zero goals and mitigating the impact of climate change on Vancity\n- \u00b7  Talent: attracting and retaining the employees we need\n- \u00b7  Credit: uncertainty in retail and office space market\n- \u00b7  Technology: modernizing our platforms to meet member expectations; open banking/consumerdirected finance; and the potential impacts of cryptocurrencies\n\nFor more, see Climate-related Financial Risk Disclosures (TCFD) on page 34 and risk management on page 31 of the accountability statements .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Leadership diversity.\n\nVancity is part of the federal 50-30 Challenge to accelerate diversity and improve equity at our Board and senior management 1 levels. The goal is to attain gender parity (50 per cent) and at least 30 per cent representation of under-represented groups to build a more diverse, inclusive and vibrant economic future for Canadians. We want to be bolder so that by the end of 2025 we reflect our community diversity with a Board and a senior management team where at least 40 per cent identify as Indigenous, Black or people of colour, 2SLGBTQIA+, gender or sexually diverse, and people living with a disability.\n\nGender parity\n\n(self-identified as women and/or transgender or non-binary)\n\n(self-identified as women and/or transgender or non-binary) (self-identified as women and/or transgender or non-binary)\n\n## Gender parity Gender parity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Under-represented groups Under-represented groups Under-represented groups (self-identified as IBPOC and/or 2SLGBTQIA+ and/or\n\n(self-identified as IBPOC and/or 2SLGBTQIA+ and/or gender or sexually diverse and/or living with a disability) (self-identified as Indigenous, Black or a person of colour and/or 2SLGBTQIA+ and/or  gender or sexually diverse and/or living with a disability) gender or sexually diverse and/or living with a disability)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard\n\nSenior Management\n\n1  Senior management includes director-level roles and above.",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nPutting people and planet first is at the core of Vancity's identity and business model. We've been carbon neutral in our own operations since 2008, we do not invest in or lend to fossil fuel companies, yet we recognize more must be done to address the climate emergency.\n\n## Climate risks and opportunities\n\nWe define our time horizons as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Short term 3-5 years\n- \u00b7  Medium term 5-10 years\n- \u00b7  Long term 10-20 years\n\nOur strategic planning process is annual, leading to a strategic plan with short-term targets. In 2022, we are planning to set a first round of interim climate targets for 2025. We will use available tools and pathways in line with what the climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. We do not yet classify our risks across time horizons. Doing so will depend on both the climate action plan and scenario analysis work.\n\nVancity advocates at every level of government for the integration of climate-related risks and opportunities into the economy. We sit on the federal government's Sustainable Finance Action Council, and we meet regularly with policymakers to discuss strategies for reducing GHG emissions from commercial and residential buildings.\n\n## Impacts from climate risks and opportunities on business, strategy and financial planning\n\nWe need to do more than be carbon neutral in our operations, which is why we've set a target to bring our financed emissions to net zero by 2040, ahead of most other Canadian financial institutions. As we understand more about our own financed emissions and opportunities to reduce them, we are incorporating this into our Climate Action Plan. This Plan will direct our strategy to achieve net zero, including the release of interim targets, priorities for advocacy, strategies and actions to reduce our financed emissions.\n\nVancity's lending and community investing decisions, as well as our procurement decisions, are guided by our Ethical Principles for\n\nBusiness Relationships (EPBR). The EPBR direct our lending, investing, and procurement teams to put particular focus on working with businesses and organizations that align with core Vancity values. This explicitly includes businesses and organizations that show 'environmental and sustainability leadership.' Loans to such businesses and organizations are included in our triple bottom line assets and assets under administration (TBLAA), for which we have ambitious growth targets in our annual performance metrics.\n\nWe need to do more than be carbon neutral in our operations which is why we've set a target to bring our financed emissions to net zero by 2040, ahead of most other Canadian financial institutions.\n\nOur subsidiary Vancity Investment Management (VCIM) incorporates a four-part climate risk strategy of divestment, decarbonization, reinvestment, and engagement to investment decisions. VCIM has divested from companies that are primarily involved in the production, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels. VCIM has joined the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and is committed to achieving net zero by 2050 for VCIM managed portfolios. VCIM also represents Vancity as a founding member of Climate Engagement Canada , alongside 20 other Canadian institutions.\n\nThe strategy of our subsidiary Vancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB) is to fill gaps in the clean energy landscape that are underserved by other investors. For example, VCIB provides financing dedicated to the under-invested small to mid-size renewable energy market. VCIB financed the world's largest wastewater energy transfer project in 2021, supplying 90 per cent of Toronto Western Hospital's heating and cooling needs. VCIB works with businesses and institutions developing, testing and demonstrating emerging technologies such as geo-exchange and bioenergy systems.\n\nGoing beyond the general qualitative scenarios used for ICAAP, in 2022 Vancity plans to use specific scenario pathways developed by a Bank of Canada pilot program. This work will be aided by a climate risk management consultant and will be particularly useful in developing a sense of our potential future physical and transition risks under different warming scenarios.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\n## Process for identifying and assessing climate risks\n\nClimate-related risk is one of nine key risk dimensions monitored quarterly and reported to both the RMC and the Board Risk Committee, guided by our Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The climate risk dimension is divided into physical risk and transition risk with a risk appetite of medium, reflecting there is both risk in how Vancity affects the climate and how the climate affects Vancity. Including climate risk as a key risk dimension allows us to assess it in conjunction with other risks, as climate risk can affect multiple risk dimensions.\n\nWhile we have some influence over how we affect the climate, if the global community doesn't also act to keep warming below 2\u00b0C, the consequences for Vancity will be severe. Even with a 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario there will be greater climate risks facing Vancity than have existed in the past.\n\nThe 2021 heatwaves and wildfires in BC are something we expect to see more frequently in the short term. We also expect greater rainfall during the winter, which is likely to increase flooding, and we expect rising sea levels in the longer term. We've identified flooding as our greatest current and short-term climate-related physical risk, with wildfires as an emerging risk given our lending growth in higher risk fire areas. In 2021, we used a live wildfire map of BC and overlaid it with our mortgage portfolio. Forecasting the potential future scale of these risks is new and challenging. We are working with other organizations to help us develop models from which we can set appropriate risk tolerances and monitoring.\n\n## Managing climate risks and integration of climate risk into risk management practices\n\nWhile we've monitored flood risk in our lending portfolio for some years, in 2021 we significantly improved the model to assess at six-digit postal code levels. The results showed a decrease in our overall flood risk exposure. We are currently evaluating ways to manage this risk beyond insurance coverage. We've begun conversations with our retail and business members about climate risk mitigation they can perform to increase their resilience. Further data refinement may allow us to target these conversations more specifically. We expect to make improvements to the flood model as it doesn't currently assess urban flooding from overwhelmed infrastructure or sewer backups. Further, the fluvial (river flooding) assessment is only based on the Fraser River and its tributaries and assumes flood defences are adequate, which we saw failed in many places in late 2021. We expect to have improved flood risk modelling in place for 2022 and in the same year develop enhanced wildfire modelling tools.\n\nOur financed emissions have been an early identified transition risk and opportunity. Our work using the PCAF model (see page 17 ) shows us where our highest concentrations of financed emissions are. It also identifies where we can lead and have higher impact, for example, by encouraging and supporting electrification. In addition, we will increase our financing for the development of new net-zero buildings and climate adaptation solutions.\n\nTransition risk can be further divided into policy, legal and regulatory, market, and reputational risks. We manage legal risk by making decisions within existing legal and regulatory frameworks. We also monitor the legal and regulatory landscape, keeping close contact with industry associations and all levels of government to understand and influence policy and regulatory direction. We seek to understand our community's needs, which we translate into changes in our products and service offerings as well as our strategy and messaging.\n\nWe've begun the process to quantify our transition risk in our lending and investing activities. We've started by separately assessing retail lending, commercial lending, and investing. To do so, we've assigned transition risk levels to industry sectors based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). This early work has identified data and process actions we need to take to improve our assessment.\n\nOn the investing side, we are guided by our Ethical Principles which include environmental and sustainability leadership. We conduct carbon footprinting, both absolute (market capitalization based) and relative (revenue based) for scope 1 and 2 emissions, as part of our climate risk assessments, and review how companies are managing climate risks to ensure we are offering sustainable investments for our members.\n\nOur subsidiary, VCIM, also conducts positive impact revenue analysis to identify opportunities to invest in companies contributing to the climate-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We see a significant opportunity to put our members' investing power to use in driving a just climate transition, with new contributions directed to only responsible investment options, by the end of 2022.",

This maps impact associations for each of the sectors and products. It further highlights sectors and activities that are key (most significant) to each of the impact areas. There are 22 potential impact areas, which are aligned to the UN's 17 SDGs.\n\nIn 2021, we used version 2.0 of UNEP FI's Portfolio Impact Analysis Tool for the analysis. The updated version of the tool is more detailed with revised mapping for sector impacts, and it now includes the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes used by Vancity.\n\n## Consumer banking\n\nThe impact areas most associated with consumer banking products at Vancity are shown in the graphic below.\n\n## Potential impact areas associated with consumer banking products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: The impact areas in bold are the most significant.\n\nIn general, all consumer banking products have potential positive associations with Employment and Inclusive, Healthy Communities. Credit products including microcredit also have potential negative associations with Inclusive, Healthy Communities if they're not designed to be fair and accessible, especially to those traditionally excluded from banking services. Our microcredit products, designed to help individuals with limited credit history, such as recent immigrants to Canada, have positive associations with Justice and Economic Equality.\n\nCredit products and account services facilitate consumer spending, but we lack the data to understand the spending patterns (and associated impacts) of our members. However, we can say with certainty that there are additional key negative associations with consumer credit on Climate, Waste and Resources Efficiency.\n\nWhile relatively few members access motor vehicle loans, many members purchase vehicles through consumer credit, and their potential impact is significant. From efforts to measure financed emissions, we know that motor vehicle loans generate the most greenhouse gases per dollar loaned.\n\n## Business banking\n\nThe key impact areas associated with the greatest proportion of our business loan portfolio (primarily small- and medium-sized enterprises, or SMEs) are shown in the graphic below.\n\n## Potential key impact areas associated with business lending",

        "page_content": "The majority of our business lending supports the real estate sector - both directly and indirectly through mortgage lending. This explains our key positive impacts on Housing and Health and Sanitation, and our key negative impacts of Climate and Resources Efficiency. Additional potential negative impacts include Waste, Culture and Heritage, and Biodiversity and Ecosystems.\n\nHowever, while not key impact associations, every organization we lend to contributes to Employment - positively and negatively, depending on working conditions - and most contribute positively to Inclusive, Healthy Communities We typically lend to small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including social enterprises, not-for-profits and co-operatives. In our primary market of BC, SMEs account for the majority of companies and are responsible for approximately half of private sector employment in the province. We understand that some of the sectors we support (such as food and beverage services, accommodations services, health and social work) are associated with poorer job quality and/or fewer career prospects, and that certain jobs are more vulnerable to change due to technology and/or climate change.\n\nSTEP 3: Context and relevance - To help determine which of these impact areas are our most significant ones, we needed to take our operating context into account, in particular community needs. We operate in Canada, and primarily within the province of BC. Applying the 'Country Needs' resource in the Portfolio Impact Tool, we determined that the most relevant challenges and priorities in Canada/BC that intersect with Vancity regions in which we operate are:\n\n- \u00b7  Climate (based on greenhouse gas emissions)\n- \u00b7  Resources efficiency (based on energy, water and materials consumption)\n- \u00b7  Waste (based on solid waste generated and recycling rates)\n- \u00b7  Housing (specifically the housing cost overburden for low-income owners and renters)\n\nWe need to do more work to fully understand and monitor needs across the 22 areas identified in the UNEP FI's Impact Radar, such as mapping needs at a more granular level (e.g., across BC) and separately for Indigenous communities.\n\nSTEP 4: Scale and intensity/salience of impact - Through the initial 2020 impact analysis, we identified Climate as a significant impact area. This was validated through the 2021 impact analysis. To understand our climate impact more fully, we improved and expanded our financed emissions data using the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard. See page 17 for an overview of our financed emissions by asset class.\n\nIn 2021, we identified our second significant impact area, Financial Health and Inclusion, based on the above results, and further informed by member feedback and the work we've been doing for decades in this area: every two years we ask members about their priorities for Vancity to focus on. We conducted further research using the Canadian Financial Resilience Index to better understand the level of resilience and vulnerability of our members.\n\nOur dual focus on Climate and Financial Health and Inclusion supports our Climate Commitments strategy to work towards a climate transition that puts people at its centre and leaves no one behind. It further aligns with existing strategic business opportunities, for example, our Planet-Wise suite of products and the Vancity Fair & Fast Loan (an alternative to payday loans).",

Scope: The bank's core business areas, products/services across the main geographies that the bank operates in have been as described under 1.1 have been considered in the scope of the analysis.\n- b. Scale of exposure: In identifying its areas of most significant impact the bank has considered where its core business/its major activities lie in terms of industries, technologies and geographies.\n- c. Context and relevance: Your bank has taken into account the most relevant challenges and priorities related to sustainable development in the countries/regions in which it operates.\n- d. Scale and intensity/salience of impact: In identifying its areas of most significant impact, the bank has considered the scale and intensity/salience of the (potential) social, economic and environmental impacts resulting from the bank's activities and provision of products and services.

We did not include Vancity's own investments, or off-balance-sheet managed client assets.\n\n## b. Scale of exposure\n\nThe three most significant potential impact areas most associated with consumer banking products at Vancity are Inclusive, Healthy Communities, Employment, and Climate.\n\nFor business banking, the three most significant potential impact areas are Housing, Climate, and Health and Sanitation.\n\n## c. Context and relevance\n\nApplying the Country Needs resource in the Portfolio Impact Tool, we determined that the most relevant challenges and priorities in Canada and BC that intersect with Vancity regions in which we operate are:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate (based on greenhouse gas emissions)\n- \u00b7 Resources efficiency (based on energy, water and materials consumption)\n- \u00b7 Waste (based on solid waste generated and recycling rates)\n- \u00b7 Housing (specifically the housing cost overburden for low-income owners and renters).\n\nImpact analysis,\n\np. 39\n\n2020 Annual Report\n\n, p. 42\n\nFinanced emissions,\n\np. 16",

The bank should have identified a baseline (assessed against a particular year) and have set targets against this baseline.\n\nShow that the bank has analyzed and acknowledged significant (potential) negative impacts of the set targets on other dimensions of the SDG/climate change/society's goals and that it has set out relevant actions to mitigate those as far as feasible to maximize the net positive impact of the set targets.\n\n## Targets\n\nClimate: We have published a goal of net-zero emissions across our mortgages and loans by 2040. We have announced that we will publish interim targets in 2022 along with our implementation plan.\n\nFinancial Health and Inclusion: We have been promoting financial health and inclusion for decades and we currently track several related metrics (e.g., units of affordable housing financed). In December 2021, we were one of the founding signatories of the PRB's Commitment to Financial Health and Inclusion (CFHI) which requires us to set and publish targets within 18 months of signing (by June 2023). We are in the process of identifying the appropriate areas, metrics and baselines for target setting.\n\n## Alignment and baseline\n\nClimate: Our net zero by 2040 goal is ten years ahead of the Paris Agreement targets and the net-zero targets set by the Canadian and BC governments. Vancity was the first Canadian financial institution to join the UN-led Net-Zero Banking Alliance in 2021, and we were already committed to the UN's Collective Commitment to Climate Action (CCCA).\n\nOur work in 2021 focused on improving the accuracy and coverage of financed emissions data. Applying the Global PCAF methodology, we expanded the scope of our financed emissions disclosures and improved our data quality score in three asset classes. We also explored best practices and approaches for target setting and decarbonizing mortgages and loans. We considered the UNEP Guidelines, Paris Alliance Investment Initiative, Science-Based Targets Initiative, Climate Action A100+ and Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance.\n\nWe established baseline (2019) data for our first set of near-term climate target(s) focusing on three asset classes that are responsible for most of our known lending-related emissions: commercial mortgages, residential mortgages, and general-purpose business loans. Our intention is for our target setting process to align with the UNEP FI's Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks .\n\n## Potential negative impacts - for both targets\n\nFor the climate transition to succeed, we need more people to be able to reduce their emissions and to fully participate in the clean economy that follows. Our work to build increased financial resilience in the face of climate-related shocks, particularly amongst our more vulnerable members and communities, is key to ensuring a just transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nNow that we have identified our priority areas, we have begun work to more fully understand and maximize positive/reduce negative impacts on people and the planet. This includes conducting research and engaging with thought-leaders and experts, peers, community partners, and members.\n\n## Please provide your bank's conclusion/statement if it has fulfilled the requirements regarding Target Setting.\n\nWe have partially fulfilled the requirements by identifying climate as one area where we have significant impact, and making public our goal to be net zero by 2040. We are working on establishing interim climate targets and identifying a second significant area of impact.\n\n## Financed emissions, Impact analysis, p. 39\n\np. 16\n\nNet-zero commitment\n\nFinancing an equitable climate\n\ntransition",

These principles focus on stakeholder engagement to inform strategy and decision-making:\n\n- \u00b7  Inclusivity - taking into consideration information and insights gathered from engagement with members, communities and others we have an impact on or who have an impact on us, and including these groups in our response to sustainability\n- \u00b7  Materiality - determining the relevance and importance of an issue to our organization, to our members and their communities, and to society\n- \u00b7  Responsiveness - demonstrating responsiveness to issues through our decisions and actions, and through communications, including our annual reports and strategic plans\n- \u00b7  Impact - taking accountability for the effects our behaviour, performance and outcomes have on the economy, the environment, society, stakeholders or Vancity\n\nOur annual report is aligned with the International Integrated Reporting Framework (January 2021) and is also prepared, including the accountability statements, in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards.\n\nWe include specific material topics in our annual reporting, placing greater emphasis on the most material. Under the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles, material topics 'substantively influence and impact the assessments, decisions, actions and performance of an organization and/or its stakeholders in the short, medium and/or long term.' In 2021, we conducted a materiality assessment using the topics with GRI standards as a starting point and considered the materiality definitions used in the GRI standard and the IR Framework, as well as AA1000.\n\nWe choose the content for our annual reporting based on our business plans, the impacts we have and the value we create, and what our members and other stakeholders tell us they want to know.\n\nAs a financial co-operative, members are our main stakeholder they are both our customers and our investors or providers of financial capital. We regularly engage with them in developing our products and services and in our strategic planning process. Every two years we ask members about their priorities for Vancity to focus on. We considered the survey conducted in 2020, and feedback received on previous reports from members, employees and experts, including those from the UNEP FI PRB office and the Value Reporting Foundation. Our business plans and discussions with our Board Directors and executive leadership team also informed the choice of topics, as did a review of industry peer reports.\n\n' It is the Board's responsibility to ensure the integrity of this integrated report. It is our opinion that it is presented in accordance with the International Integrated Reporting Framework.'\n\nAnita Braha, Board Chair, on behalf of the Vancity Board of Directors\n\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the annual report plan and performance metrics, and ensures an effective process is in place to identify material topics. The Board approves this integrated annual report and accountability statements prior to their release.\n\nOne firm provides assurance over key accountability information and principles as well as audits the financials. External assurance provides confidence that key information is complete, accurate and balanced. It also drives improvements and integration in our management and reporting practices.\n\nIn the accountability statements see page 38 for our Material topics and page 39 for the GRI content index.",

As such, Vancity applies the AccountAbility Principles, ISO 14064 - Part 1, and internally developed reporting criteria (collectively the 'applicable criteria') that are described in the 2021 Annual Report glossary, the accountability statements, and the 2021 GHG handbook and inventory report available at www.vancity.com/AnnualReport .\n\n## Vancity's responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Subject Matter, in accordance with the applicable criteria, current as at the date of our report and for determining the appropriateness of the use of the applicable criteria.\n\nManagement is also responsible for determining Vancity's objectives in respect of accountability performance and reporting, including the identification of stakeholders and material issues, and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported Subject Matter is derived.",

        "page_content": "## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility in relation to the Subject Matter is to perform an assurance engagement and to express conclusions based on the evidence obtained. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements , issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410 require that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain the stated level of assurance, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\n\n## Independence, quality control and competence\n\nWe have complied with the relevant rules of professional conduct/ code of ethics applicable to the practice of public accounting and related to assurance engagements, issued by various professional accounting bodies, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nThe firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance Engagements and, accordingly, maintains a comprehensive system of quality control, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe engagement was conducted with a multidisciplinary team, which included professionals with suitable experience in both assurance and in the applicable Subject Matter, including AA1000AP, environmental, social and financial performance, and GHG accounting.\n\n## What is limited vs. reasonable assurance?\n\nWe were engaged to perform an assurance engagement at either a reasonable or limited level according to the Subject Matter being assured. The extent of evidence gathering procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than that for a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore a lower level of assurance is obtained. Limited assurance procedures consist primarily of inquiries and applying analytical procedures to the Subject Matter, as appropriate. In addition to inquiries and analytical procedures, reasonable assurance procedures could include testing the design and effectiveness of internal controls, obtaining third party or supporting evidence, and performing recalculations.\n\n## Assurance approach - our procedures\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users of our report.\n\nWe planned and performed our work to obtain all the evidence, information and explanations we considered necessary in order to form our assurance conclusions as set out above. The nature, timing and extent of procedures depended on our professional judgement including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, as well as, the level of assurance being provided and included:\n\n- \u00b7  Interviews with senior management, including the Executive Leadership Team and the Board of Directors, and relevant employees to gain an understanding of the process for determining the material issues for Vancity's key stakeholder groups, the development of Vancity's accountability strategy, and the implementation of accountability policies across the business;\n- \u00b7  Obtaining supporting evidence relating to representations made by interviewees and reviewing key organizational documents concerning accountability at Vancity including strategy documents, formalized policies and procedures, and Board reporting;\n- \u00b7  Reviewing the results of member and employee research insights on accountability reporting and material issues;\n- \u00b7  Inquiries with relevant employees to understand the data collection and reporting processes for the targets and results;\n- \u00b7  Performing walkthroughs to test the design, and where applicable the operating effectiveness, of internal controls relating to the collection and reporting of data measuring Vancity's progress on the targets and results;\n- \u00b7  Comparing the reported data for the targets and results, including greenhouse gas emissions and carbon offsets, to underlying data sources, including third-party evidence;\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of key assumptions and, where appropriate, re-performance of calculations; and,\n- \u00b7  Reviewing the targets and results presented in the Report to determine whether reported progress is consistent with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the social, environmental and economic performance of Vancity.\n\nWe believe the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nNon-financial information, such as that included in the Report, is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of significant elements of the Subject Matter and the availability and relative precision of methods used for determining both qualitative and quantitative information. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques which can result in materially different measurements and can impact comparability. The nature and methods used to determine such information, as described in management's internally developed criteria, may change over time. It is important to read Vancity's reporting methodology in the 2021 Annual Report glossary, the consolidated accountability statements, and the 2021 GHG handbook and inventory report available at\n\nwww.vancity.com/AnnualReport\n\n.\n\n## Chartered Professional Accountants\n\nMay 5, 2022 Vancouver, Canada",
